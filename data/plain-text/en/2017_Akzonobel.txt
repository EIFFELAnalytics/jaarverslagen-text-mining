As we forge ahead to build for the future and maximize the
power of our brands, the company is sharpening its focus.
We have a new management team in place; have adopted a
new structure to create a simpler, faster organization ready
to adapt to new industry challenges; have committed to
new financial guidance of 15% ROS* by 2020 and remain as
dedicated as ever to delivering for our customers. Thanks to
the tireless effort of our hard-working colleagues around the
world, AkzoNobel is entering an exciting new era.

2017 was an extraordinary year
for AkzoNobel. Our people helped
the company deliver volume
and revenue growth while going
through a time of unprecedented
change. And as that period
of transformation continues,
our commitment to unlocking
value, accelerating growth and
contributing to the success of our
customers – to becoming a world
class, global market leader in the
paints and coatings industry –
becomes stronger by the day.

CFO Maëlys Castella took a leave of absence, also for health
reasons. She has been an integral part of establishing a solid
financial foundation. We look forward to welcoming her back
in a senior management role once she returns.
The improvements Ton and Maëlys brought about were
crucial and helped pave the way for the new AkzoNobel.
Thanks to their vision, leadership and expertise, we
established a solid structure and put key processes in place

“AS WE FORGE AHEAD
TO BUILD FOR THE FUTURE
AND MAXIMIZE THE POWER
OF OUR BRANDS, THE
COMPANY IS SHARPENING
ITS FOCUS”
There were many notable events during 2017, although the
milestone development was the decision to separate our
Specialty Chemicals business.
Another major change saw CEO Ton Büchner step down
for health reasons. Ton’s contribution to the company
was immense. He put in place a strong operational
foundation, providing a solid platform for the future. I feel
privileged to have worked with him and honored to have
succeeded him.

which have enabled the company to move forward and
take the next step. Our new strategy – which has powerful
performance and precise processes as cornerstones – is
therefore a natural progression. It will make us more agile
and drive the streamlining of our core capabilities – making
and selling paint and striving for the best efficiency and
performance in what we do.
We gave full details of this new strategic direction when we
officially announced our plans to create two focused, high
performing companies – Paints and Coatings, and Specialty

Chemicals. We have widespread shareholder support for
the direction we are taking and our focus now is on ensuring
a successful separation of Specialty Chemicals. As of
January 1, 2018, we have been operating as two separate
companies under the AkzoNobel umbrella, ready for formal
separation in April. As well as enabling Specialty Chemicals
to realize its full potential, this will create a leaner, stronger
Paints and Coatings company to take AkzoNobel forward.

As a focused Paints and Coatings company, we have
changed the structure of our Executive Committee and the
way we operate and work with each other – underpinned
by the roll-out of a world class Integrated Business Planning
process. Designed to support a more efficient and faster
way of working, we have reorganized the company by
separating our commercial activities (led by Chief Operating

Officer, Ruud Joosten) from those in our supply chain (led by
Chief Supply Chain Officer, David Allen), while maintaining
very close cooperation between the two. This means
on the commercial side, we will have a clearer focus on
customers, delivering on our new financial guidance and
achieving profitable growth. And by centralizing all supply
chain responsibilities – including manufacturing – into a single,
global function with dedicated experts, we can serve our
customers more efficiently by further driving standardization,
building functional excellence, leveraging expertise and
assets across our businesses and accelerating our
AkzoNobel Leading Performance System (ALPS) program.
We expect to start seeing the benefits already in 2018.
Due to this reorganization, the roles of Executive Committee
members responsible for Business Areas became redundant.
It was therefore mutually and amicably decided that
Mr. Conrad Keijzer would step down in April 2017.

Throughout 2017, I am proud to say we never lost focus.
We continued to deliver for our customers, develop new
and exciting products, grow the business and increase our
operational efficiency. We achieved another record year of
EBIT (including discontinued operations), despite significant
external headwinds, and delivered real organic growth,
supplemented by the three acquisitions I referred to earlier.
Specialty Chemicals achieved record results as it prepares
to become a standalone business, led by Werner Fuhrmann.
Meanwhile, the investments we are making to drive growth
were evident throughout our portfolio, and throughout the

During 2017, we received unsolicited proposals from a
competitor which undervalued AkzoNobel and raised a
number of other concerns. We carefully and seriously
considered each of these proposals, but concluded they
were not in the best long-term interests of the company,
its shareholders and other stakeholders. We also held
constructive discussions about a possible merger with
one of our peers, which ended without agreement. As
the industry continues to consolidate, we will continue to
strengthen our business model, with a singular focus on
further improvement. However, we remain open to exploring
relevant opportunities, including bolt-on acquisitions,
illustrated by three acquisitions we made in 2017 – Flexcrete
Technologies in the UK, Disa Technology in France and the
business of V.Powdertech in Thailand (see page 11).

Leadership

This is something we have been building up to for some
time, driven by sustained operational and financial
performance improvements. The company has solid
financials and our single focus on the proud craft of making
the finest paints and coatings will enable us to make a
step-change in our performance and long-term value
creation, with a clear commitment to achieving our 2020
financial guidance.

how we work with our customers.

world, as various new sites opened and several locations
were expanded – including our research and development
facilities in Houston, Texas.
One of the highlights was the official opening of our new
Ashington, UK, site (pictured on previous page). The facility
is the world’s most advanced and sustainable paint plant
and is the new center of production for Dulux in the UK
(see page 12 for more details). It’s physical proof of our
strategy in action and I feel immensely proud of what our
colleagues have achieved there. In addition, we opened a
new €31 million plant for coatings in Chonburi, Thailand, a
new Aerospace Color Center in Dongguan, China, and we
are building the biggest powder coatings plant of its kind in
Changzhou, China.
The Specialty Chemicals business also expanded several
sites. As well as increasing capacity for sodium hydrosulfide
in LeMoyne (US), a capacity expansion was inaugurated for
producing organic peroxides in Los Reyes (Mexico). In China,
an important expansion was completed at the Boxing plant,
while production capacity for dicumyl peroxide (DCP) was
boosted at the multi-site in Ningbo. And in Gujarat, India,
work started on a world-scale plant for monochloroacetic
acid (MCA) as part of a joint arrangement with Atul. All these
developments underline our commitment to working more
closely with our customers to deliver the brands, products
and technologies they need to ensure their own success.
With all that happened during the year, we made sure we
kept our eye on the ball, so it was very pleasing to be ranked
number one on the 2017 Dow Jones Sustainability Index in
the Chemicals industry. The fact we claimed top spot again

AkzoNobel Report 2017

(our fifth number one ranking in six years) says everything
about the dedication and commitment of our employees.
Our people take great pride in what they do and are always
looking to deliver more by consuming less, so this was a
notable achievement. We all believe putting sustainability
at the heart of our business strategy leads to better longterm business results, both for ourselves and our business
partners. During 2017, we put particular emphasis on
increasing our energy efficiency, reducing material waste and
continuing to deliver more eco-premium solutions and waterbased products to our customers. Sustainability is clearly
good for business.
Relevant cutting-edge innovation is also key to delivering
on our strategy and we’re making great progress with
our product development, especially in terms of providing
customers with more sustainable solutions and greater
functionality. For example, in China we introduced Dulux
Biocare, an interior paint which will boost the sustainable
development of the country’s eco-friendly residential
repainting market. We also launched Sikkens Alpha Rezisto
for the professional market in several European countries.
Its hydrophobic coating creates a surface which repels
many common household stains. In Specialty Chemicals,
notable launches included six new product applications from
the Pulp and Performance Chemicals business through its
Levasil (colloidal silica), Expancel (expandable microspheres)
and Kromasil brands.
I always like to see how people benefit from using our
products, so I was very happy that our partnership with the
MasterPeace organization achieved its goal of creating
100 Walls of Connection in cities around the world (in fact,
the eventual total was 141). An extension of our global “Let’s
Colour” initiative, we worked with artists and local residents
to help create connections between groups of people who
otherwise wouldn’t have come together (see page 14). I was
also delighted with the success of the inaugural Imagine
Chemistry innovation challenge, which attracted a lot of
interest globally and is being staged for a second time in
2018 (see page 58).

Our employees are our greatest asset and I want to thank
the proud people of AkzoNobel for all their hard work during
such a busy year. Their passion, resilience and commitment to
delighting our customers has shone throughout 2017, whether
they have been dealing with the challenges of Hurricane
Harvey in the US, driving our continuous improvement agenda,
developing new products or delivering on successfully
carrying out the separation of Specialty Chemicals. Thanks
to them, we now stand on the cusp of a new era.
It’s an honor to be the new CEO of AkzoNobel. We are building
something very special, backed by two centuries of pride and
experience. We have a new organization in place; we have a
compelling strategy and clear financial ambitions; we have
a world class portfolio of brands and products; we command
strong leadership positions in our markets and are ready to
hit the ground running as we look to continue our momentum
in 2018 and beyond. I am in no doubt we have the brands,
the products, the people – and the passion – to deliver.

Flexcrete Technologies (UK)
Manufactures industry-leading technical mortars and
high performance coatings for the protection and repair
of concrete substrates. The deal will allow us to expand
our customer offering in several key industrial markets,
including downstream oil and gas and chemical processing,
commercial infrastructure, power, water and waste water,
and mining and mineral processing. By leveraging our global
presence and existing distribution channels, we can also sell
these products more efficiently to our customers.

V.Powdertech (Thailand)
Supplies a range of powder coatings products for domestic
appliances, furniture and general industrial applications.
The acquisition will bring new technologies and services to
complement our global technology portfolio and business
in market segments such as architectural and automotive
coatings. The transaction includes all relevant technologies,
patents and trademarks, as well as a high quality manufacturing plant close to Bangkok. The deal means we are
strongly positioned to capitalize on the growth in demand for
powder coatings in South East Asia.

Financial
information

Our acquisition criteria are compelling and simple. The
targets must deliver a number one or two position in the
market, and/or offer new customer value propositions or
new technologies. In addition to strategic fit, the economics
need to be supportive of the increased financial guidance
we shared in April 2017. All recent acquisitions exceed these
criteria comfortably, delivering sustainable, long-term value
for all our stakeholders. Details about our 2017 deals can
be found below.

equipment. Acquiring the business means we can offer
our customers a broader product portfolio while
complementing our own position in liquid coatings and
films for those markets.

These acquisitions show that we are taking part in the consolidation of the paints and coatings market in a “string of
pearls” strategy. We’ve also shown that we don’t shy away
from looking at value-adding, transformative opportunities.

Having acquired BASF’s Industrial Coatings business in
2016 – a sizeable deal which added around 2% inorganic
revenue growth (AkzoNobel including Specialty Chemicals)
– we made three further bolt-on acquisitions in 2017. Key

“Ashington secures AkzoNobel’s future as a manufacturer
of cutting-edge products, including paints that improve
air quality, increase energy efficiency and protect
against bacteria,” said Ruud Joosten, Chief Operating
Officer of Paints and Coatings. “We have taken the best
technology available globally, improved on it and put it all
under one roof, ensuring that this new facility represents
a significant step forward for the whole industry.”
The new center of production for Dulux – a global megabrand and the UK’s leading decorative paint brand – the
facility uses a variety of renewable energy sources,
including photovoltaic cells and a biomass boiler which
burns wood pellets from managed forests in the UK.

The factory will be capable of producing enough paint

Cuprinol, Polycell, Hammerite and Armstead.

For AkzoNobel, however, the state-of-the-art factory
– the largest ever global investment in the company’s
paints activities – was proof of our growth strategy
in action.

It’s estimated that the carbon footprint per liter of paint
produced at the site will be 50% lower when compared
with facilities at the plants it is replacing. This makes it
an excellent example of how we apply our sustainable
business imperative of resource productivity in practice.

When we opened the world’s

CONNECTING
PEOPLE AND PLACES

Leadership

Ever since we launched our
partnership with the MasterPeace
organization in early 2017, people
have started to fall in love with
walls all over again.

Some commented that they literally saw the barriers
between people collapse before their eyes. And it’s
something which has the power to create lasting change.
All the artworks that have been created around the
world are a permanent visual reminder which people can
see every day and be proud of.

“Let’s Colour” Walls of Connection has demonstrated the
power of paint brands, such as Dulux, to uplift communities
and make living spaces more liveable and enjoyable. In fun
and surprising ways, these walls have brought communities
together in celebrating unity, kindness and connection.
Nearly 400 artists and more than 5,200 people (including
259 AkzoNobel volunteers) joined in during 2017.

Financial
information

The beauty of the project is that it has enabled connections
to be made between groups of people who otherwise
wouldn’t have come together. Launched at the Albeda
College in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, the event made a
lasting impact on many of those who were involved. The
young people who took part embraced the opportunity to
connect and overcome division and drew praise for how
energized they were.

Another great thing about our MasterPeace partnership
is that it provided an opportunity for our employees to
get involved and contribute to the societies in which we
operate. In fact, employee involvement is one of the main
criteria we use in setting up most of our partnerships, driven
by the fact that collaborating with others is a vital part of
what we do.
Working with MasterPeace was rewarding for all involved.
Together, we’ve helped many people to break down barriers
and become connected in a very special way. You could say
that walls really did come tumbling down.

For more information, please visit:
www.masterpeace.org/walls-of-connection

Sustainability
statements

Known as Walls of Connection, it was a simple idea,
but proved to be brilliantly effective. We got artists and
local residents together to create designs which were
then painted onto a wall in the local community. In total,
141 walls have been painted in 31 cities, helping to
make people’s lives more liveable and inspiring.

Governance and
compliance

In cities in particular, we increasingly see invisible walls
creating separation and detachment. Our initiative with
global peace movement MasterPeace is helping to
overcome that barrier.

Our oceans are under attack –
from a small but powerful enemy
– and the statistics are staggering.
More than five trillion pieces of
plastic currently litter the seas
around the world, with eight million

Some even claim that by 2050,
there will be more plastic than fish

Fortunately, that’s exactly what’s happening. Back in 2013,
young Dutchman Boyan Slat had become so concerned
about the state of the world’s oceans that he decided to set
up The Ocean Cleanup with the express aim of ridding the
seas of plastic.
Fast forward to today and his vision is edging ever closer
to reality. A floating system is being developed which could
clean 50% of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch (located
half-way between Hawaii and California) in five years. The
technology is now at the prototype stage, with the first
operational clean-up system scheduled to be deployed in
the Great Pacific Garbage Patch by mid-2018.

AkzoNobel Report 2017

To help protect the equipment from the harsh marine
environment, AkzoNobel has partnered with The Ocean
Cleanup and will provide biocide-free coatings technology for
all its devices for the next five years. As the world’s largest
producer of marine coatings – with a maritime heritage
stretching back more than a century – the partnership offers
a natural showcase for the company’s expertise.
The most high profile use of AkzoNobel’s International range
of products will be on the specially designed floating cleanup system which will collect the waste plastic. The system
employs U-shaped screens to channel floating plastic to a
central point. The concentrated plastic can then be extracted

and shipped to shore for recycling into durable products.
It’s designed to capture plastic pieces of all sizes, from one
centimeter right up to massive discarded fishing nets, which
can measure tens of meters. By removing the plastic while
most of it is still large, it can be prevented from breaking
down into dangerous micro-plastics.
“The ocean plastic pollution problem is a very big one, and
big problems require big solutions,” explains Boyan. “This
has been my mission since I started The Ocean Cleanup
and, with the help of many partners, we have come a long
way. After all, don’t we all want a future that is better than
the present?”

The Ocean Cleanup’s systems will be equipped with an impenetrable
screen to catch the sub-surface debris. This will allow sea life to safely pass
underneath the screen with the current. The system will be protected by
biocide-free Intersleek products, which are already helping to make
the shipping industry more sustainable by reducing fuel consumption and
cutting emissions.

Our strategy
In 2017, we announced the
decision to create two focused,
high performing companies –
Paints and Coatings, and Specialty
Chemicals – with separation
due to take place by April 2018.
Pursuing this strategy will drive
a step-change in growth and
value creation and enable both
businesses to become more agile,
while accelerating profitability.
Increased financial guidance was
also announced for the two
new businesses.

Our focused strategy for Paints and Coatings will accelerate
growth and profitability, while increasing returns to all our
stakeholders. We are creating a fit-for-purpose organization
with clearer customer focus, continued cost discipline, a
performance culture and simplified ways of working. Our
financial guidance for this refocused business is 15% return

Meanwhile, by centralizing all supply chain responsibilities
– including manufacturing and procurement – into a single,
global function with dedicated experts, we can further drive
progress across a number of key areas. We can achieve
faster standardization, build functional excellence, leverage
scale and expertise across our businesses and accelerate
our ALPS continuous improvement program.
To help connect these teams and drive delivery, we
are rolling out Integrated Business Planning across the

company. This will provide the heartbeat for achieving
alignment and delivering a common operating plan. It will
further drive efficiency, improve transparency and be the
driving force to help us lower the cost of getting products
to our customers. Operational excellence and continuous
improvement programs also remain at the heart of our plans
across all functions – we aim to realize €150 million a year in
savings from continuous improvement, which will contribute
significantly to achieving our 2020 financial guidance.
In addition, we have introduced a new role of Chief Technology Officer to sharpen our medium to long-term innovation
road map and drive opportunities closer to our customer
needs. One of the key responsibilities of this role is to help
realize synergies across Paints and Coatings and drive
clearer benefits from our innovation efforts, including building
on our increasing focus on digital business innovation.

Going forward, we will continue to develop our world
class portfolio of brands and products – including Dulux,
International, Sikkens and Interpon – with a focus on
sustainable and digital solutions which will help bring us
closer to our customers. Remaining open to exploring
relevant opportunities, including bolt-on acquisitions, also
continues to be part of our strategy.

Financial
information

On the commercial side, this new structure will enable a
clearer focus on our customers, delivering our new financial
targets and achieving sustainable, profitable growth. To
ensure maximum customer focus and agility, our paints
and coatings activities have been consolidated into eight
business units from the start of 2018, all reporting to the
Chief Operating Officer directly.

At our investor update held in London in April, we gave full details of the new strategy for the company – including the separation of
Specialty Chemicals – and announced updated financial guidance for 2020.

By creating a high performance, fit-for-purpose organization
with a clear and single focus, we intend to accelerate
our growth momentum and enhance profitability. We are
committed to increasing returns to shareholders, while
continuing to invest in growth, creating sustainable value
for all our stakeholders to become a truly global paints and
coatings leader.

In order to support this, we have put a new Executive
Committee structure in place designed to not only drive
operational synergies and standardization, but also leverage
expertise across the business. To enable a more efficient and
faster way of working, we have separated our commercial
activities (led by Chief Operating Officer, Ruud Joosten) from
those in our supply chain (led by Chief Supply Chain Officer,
David Allen), while maintaining close cooperation between
the two (see page 38 for more operational insight).

Success will be found in streamlining our core capabilities –
making and selling paint – and striving for the best efficiency
and performance in what we do. We aim to set the standard,
be first choice for customers and shape the industry. To help
us achieve our ambitions, we have launched a “Winning

Accelerating growth
Our key customers are winning in growth markets and we
aim to grow with them. We are managing our margins to
better adapt to changing raw material prices while analyzing
our portfolio to fine-tune our products, customers and
prices. Strong focus on commercializing our existing new
product introduction pipeline, expanding our growing range

We have a strong track record of improving profitability.
By maintaining our commitment to operational excellence,
we will build on these achievements. Continuous and
thorough analysis of our sites and production processes
will debottleneck and free up resources to run our sites to
their fullest potential. Embedding standardized processes,
continuous improvement tools and clear targets throughout
our organization will enable us to continue to improve our
fixed and variable costs, while Integrated Business Planning
will help us reduce working capital costs. This combination
of operational excellence and operating leverage will result
in higher margins and ensure attractive ROIs as per our
2020 guidance. The focus on further optimization goes
hand in hand with our unwavering commitment to safety for
our employees and the communities in which we operate,
and our belief that focusing on sustainability is simply the

smartest way to do business. We will work to maintain
our leadership position in Health, Safety, Environment and
Security performance and continue to drive the shift from
fossil fuels to renewable sources of energy, such as wind
power and biomass.

Investments to spur a step-change in growth
As a standalone company, we are well-positioned to make
strategic investments with attractive returns tailored to
the needs of our customers and the markets in which we
operate. We have identified and prioritized investments for
the next five years that will allow us to continue our success
and grow post-separation. These opportunities range from
capacity expansions in growth markets to collaborations
with start-ups and universities designed to spur innovation.
We also plan to further invest in the development of more
eco-premium solutions. In addition to organic growth
opportunities, we envisage bolt-on acquisitions in selected
areas that will enable us to truly take our growth ambitions to
the next level.

Return on sales (ROS)

We use return on sales (ROS) as a performance indicator
to reflect profitability relative to revenue. ROS as a financial
guidance aims to focus management on delivery and quality
of profits. ROS is defined as EBIT as percentage of revenue.

We use return on investment (ROI) as a performance
indicator to reflect profit relative to invested capital. ROI as a
financial guidance aims to focus management on delivering
value through returns in excess of our cost of capital. ROI
is defined as EBIT of the last 12 months as percentage of
average invested capital.

Profitability increased, with higher volume and cost savings
more than compensating for raw material price inflation and
adverse currencies.

• EBIT was impacted by higher raw material costs, partly
offset by increased selling prices, continuous improvement
and cost control
• Average invested capital of the Paints and Coatings
organization increased slightly to €6.5 billion

Cradle-to-grave carbon
footprint

Resource Efficiency Index
(REI)

In 2017, cradle-to-grave carbon footprint per ton of sales
further reduced to 7% below the 2012 baseline.

The Resource Efficiency Index measures gross margin over
carbon footprint, charting our long-term drive for margin
growth decoupled from resource constraints.

Climate change risks and opportunities are assessed via our
risk management process, aligned with recommendations of
the Financial Stability Board (FSB) Task Force on Climaterelated Financial Disclosures (TCFD). We manage potential
business risk of a regulated price on carbon, leading
to higher raw material costs, by working with suppliers
to manage their carbon footprint, embedding carbon
information at raw material level in formulating systems and
adopting an internal carbon price in investment proposals
(see Notes 5 and 6 of the Sustainability statements).

Business
performance

During 2017, sales of eco-premium solutions with customer
benefits totaled 20% of our revenue. We aim to maintain
eco-premium solutions at a sustainable 20% of revenue
through 2020 by constantly innovating.

*Including discontinued operations.

In 2017, our volume grew in all areas. We also integrated an
industrial coatings business acquired from BASF. As a result,
our carbon footprint increased slightly, even though our
emissions per ton of product went down. Combined with a
lower gross margin, the Resource Efficiency Index equaled
106, compared with the 2012 baseline of 100.

an interim dividend of €0.56 per share (2016: €0.37), with
the option to elect stock dividend, was paid. We will
propose a final dividend of €1.94 per share, making a total
2017 dividend of €2.50 (2016: €1.65) per share, up 52%.
A €1 billion special cash dividend was also paid on
December 7 as advance proceeds for the Specialty
Chemicals separation.

Full-year effective tax rate for continued operations was
33% (2016: 28%), impacted by US tax reform, several
adjustments to prior years and de-recognition of deferred tax
assets due to the Specialty Chemicals separation. Effective
tax rate going forward is expected to be 27%.

Effective raw material management helps to reduce waste
in our manufacturing operations, while reducing both our
environmental footprint and costs.

Energy

Our target is to drive towards “zero waste to landfill” and
a program is being developed to achieve this with specific
projects.

The energy we use at our sites contributes about 15% to our
cradle-to-grave carbon footprint. Renewable energy is an
important aspect of the improvements required to reduce our
carbon footprint.

Total waste per ton of production generated and leaving our
sites was down 5%, while total waste volume was down by
4%.

The proportion of renewable energy in our operations
increased to 45%.

Employees

A considerable proportion of our environmental footprint
results from the raw materials we buy, with most of the
bio-based materials exhibiting lower footprints.

At year-end 2017, the number of employees decreased by
1% to 45,400 people (year-end 2016: 46,000 people).

In 2017, 11% of all our organic raw materials came from
bio-based (renewable) sources.

Medium-term risks

Risk management in 2017
Enterprise risk management is a company-wide activity,
under the responsibility of the Board of Management and the
Executive Committee, which ensures we focus on the areas
of major risk exposure.
During 2017, we held 84 enterprise risk management
workshops. They identified around 1,700 unique risk
scenarios, which were prioritized by responsible management teams and functional experts. The outcomes of all risk
analyses are included in risk profiling and trend analysis and
shared by managers across the company at different levels.
Our initial focus is on major risks that may impact
achievement of our strategy in the next three-to-five years
(medium-term risks). We also recognize there are relevant
risk factors beyond the five-year horizon that could impact
our strategy (long-term risks). Both risk categories feature in
this chapter on the understanding they are not exhaustive
lists. There may be current risks the company has not fully
assessed, or that are currently identified as not having a
significant impact, which could, at a later stage, develop into
a material impact.

The table below summarizes the major risk factors for the company in the next three-to-five years.
The symbols represent management’s assessment of how these risks are expected to develop,
compared with the previous year.

As well as risks listed in this section, our 2017 risk landscape
changed due to the decision to separate Specialty
Chemicals, and the actions of an activist shareholder.

Risk has been assessed to remain fairly stable

External - Strategic
The separation of Specialty Chemicals is not without risk.
We have, however, assessed a complete set of risks and
mitigating measures which we believe adequately address:
• All aspects – legal, operational, human and economic – of
the path to separation
• The options to divest or demerge
• The challenges that lie beyond the separation for the
Specialty Chemicals, and Paints and Coatings businesses
During 2017, we intensified our discussions with
shareholders. We will continue to develop this, and our
communication with other stakeholders.

Global economy and the geopolitical context
The world’s geo-political situation remains unpredictable
and, despite an improved economic outlook, we continue
to operate in highly competitive markets that require us
to carefully manage cost and complexity and develop a
good understanding of end-user segments. Failure in this
area could have an immediate impact on market share and
margins and could result in the company not realizing its
financial guidance.

Mitigating actions
• Continue our strategy to bring down our operational cost
base and reduce complexity
• Leverage our Global Business Services to further
standardize core functional processes in all regions
• Further deploy our commercial excellence programs and
more sustainable product solutions to capture organic
growth
• Develop alternative business models – e-commerce,
partnerships with start-ups
• Have contingency plans prepared for a select number
of scenarios, dealing with geographical or segment
slowdowns

Strategic moves in our
value chain
An accumulation of strategic moves (horizontally and/or
vertically) impacts our competitive position and/or increases
the vulnerability of operations. Further consolidation renders
acquisitions more expensive, makes possible anti-trust
implications larger and the required synergy targets more
difficult to achieve.

Mitigating actions
• Competitive intelligence analysis of (new) competitors,
customers and suppliers
• Strengthen M&A and integration capabilities
• Enhance pipeline of viable market and technology
opportunities for mergers and acquisitions, focusing on
strategic rationale
• Pro-actively explore M&A outside auction processes

High impact product liability claims, while unlikely, could
follow from the use of former, current or new technologies
and compounds.

Due to the nature of our business, we use – and have used
– potentially hazardous compounds in product development
programs and manufacturing. We have been, and may
still be, exposed to risks of environmental releases and
contamination with associated risk of costs of regulatory
compliance and claims.

Mitigating actions

Prices for key raw materials and energy can be volatile, are
affected by economic conditions and regulations and have
a direct impact on margins. In addition, there is a non-level
playing field on a global level (e.g. shale gas, national
policies, subsidies), which affects our competitive position.
The chart below shows our relative spend on these key raw
materials, excluding energy.

Sustainability
statements

As a global business we are exposed to a variety of risks,
many beyond our control, such as unfavorable geo-political,
social or economic developments and developments in laws,
trade policies, regulations and standards. Our ambition to
grow the business across the globe will further expose us to
these risks.

Information technology
The company’s longer term IT strategy means we
increasingly rely on fewer consolidated critical applications,
including industrial process control systems. As the number
of digital exchanges of business transactions is increasing,
the non-availability of IT systems, or unauthorized access,
can have a direct impact on our business processes,
competitive position and reputation.

Our current policy is to contribute to defined contribution
schemes wherever possible. A number of defined benefit
pension and healthcare schemes from the past are generally
funded through external trusts or foundations, where
AkzoNobel faces the potential risk of funding shortfalls.

• Our policy is to offer defined contribution schemes to new
employees and, where appropriate, to existing employees.
The most significant defined benefit schemes are the

Business
performance

To support the implementation of our strategy, we continue
to implement important changes in our operating model
across the entire company.

The most significant long-term risks we observe are:
• Public concern over specific substances and their
environmental impact (such as hazardous substances,
plastics/synthetic polymers, fossil fuels), could result in
major changes in our markets
• Emerging technologies – including downstream process
technology, digital and cybercrime – transforming our
markets, the application of our products and supply
chains and triggering the introduction of an ever more
stringent legal and regulatory environment
• Failing to listen to, and engage with, an ever-widening
field of stakeholders and address their social and
environmental concerns, leading to reputation and
financial damage
• Not making sustainable business imperatives an integral
part of economic value creation, due to variable maturity
of markets, as well as real and perceived differences in
risks and opportunities
• Increased instability due to a rise in national sentiment,
increased public pressure to move away from
globalization, increased geo-political tensions and failure of
national and supranational governance, having a negative
impact on business and an effective global response
to climate change, or man-made environmental damage

It will no doubt be remembered as one of the most eventful
years in AkzoNobel’s long history, but along with that came
new opportunities.

between business needs and operational and supply chain
delivery. We’re convinced it’s the natural next step in our
evolution as we remain committed to working closely with
our customers and firmly establishing ourselves as the
number one choice.

Operating in such a dynamic, competitive environment had
its challenges, and while we experienced difficulties in certain
markets, others proved more favorable due to a combination
of regional demand, changing consumer preferences
for bio-based products and ongoing technological
advancements. The strength of our brands and products also
drove overall performance as we leveraged our scale and
continued to invest in water-based technologies and digital
solutions to support the growing needs of our customers.

Our clear strategic focus ensured we made steady progress
with our growth ambitions during the year, securing three
acquisitions. In July, we announced a double deal for the
UK’s Flexcrete Technologies Ltd. and French manufacturer
Disa Technology (Disatech). Flexcrete manufactures industryleading technical mortars and high performance coatings
for concrete, while Disatech supplies innovative adhesive
films used in the aerospace, transportation and industrial
equipment sectors. This was followed in November by the

which is also the UK’s leading decorative paint brand. We
have taken the best technology available globally, improved
on it and put it all under one roof, ensuring this new facility
represents a significant step forward for the whole industry.
It’s also home to our second Dulux Academy, set up to help
the UK painting and decorating industry meet the evergrowing demand for skilled professionals. In addition to
Ashington, we opened a new €31 million coatings plant in
Chonburi, Thailand, our ninth production site in South East
Asia. We also inaugurated a new Aerospace Color Center
in Dongguan, China, which will offer improved and faster
service to existing and new customers.

Governance and
compliance

The ability of these new plants to serve our customers
faster and more reliably is crucial, which is why our new
organizational structure is designed to not only drive
operational synergies and standardization, but also leverage
expertise across all our activities. The key to maximizing the
power of our brands, accelerating our operational excellence
benefits and working towards a lower cost to serve is
Integrated Business Planning. It will be a driving force linking
the needs of the business with our manufacturing capability

Our new Aerospace Color Center in Dongguan, China, will offer improved and faster
service to new and existing customers.

This change in the way we operate will be fundamental to

Partnerships are another way of sharing knowledge and

difficult period. There is ongoing uncertainty in the UK, but
we command a strong leadership position with our Dulux
brand and have signalled our intent to continue supplying
the best possible products for our customers by opening the

In Coatings, the Specialty, Powder and Automotive
businesses all performed well, with Powder in particular
benefiting from its global leadership position. The business
continues to grow, with new sites under construction in India
(Thane) and China (Changzhou). In fact, the Changzhou
powder plant is the biggest of its kind in the world. It was a
very different story for our Marine and Protective Coatings

Another great partnership saw us team up with global peace
movement MasterPeace. With walls so often being seen as a
symbol of division, we worked with local artists and residents
to paint 141 “Let’s Colour” Walls of Connection in over 30
cities around the world. We also widened our partnership
with SOS Children’s Villages to include six new countries
in 2018, further highlighting our ongoing commitment to
contributing to the societies in which we operate.
From a financial perspective, it was a mixed year, with
positive developments in some areas being offset by a series
of negative impacts. Although raw material prices remained
high, it’s clear that our strategy to grow the Paints business
is working, while in Coatings, aside from the challenges
presented by the downturn in the marine, and oil and gas
industries, we performed well in our other markets and made

In addition to our record financial performance, we also
achieved the lowest safety incident rate in the history of
AkzoNobel’s chemicals business. Over the last two years, we
have reduced our incident rate by 58%.
With the foundations in place, we are now focusing on the
next stage of value creation – organic growth. This gained
traction in 2017, driven by increasing demand from our
customers. To satisfy this growing demand, we approved a
series of debottlenecking investments and expanded several
sites in all our key regions.

We achieved record results in
2017 and grew the business,
despite currency headwinds and
challenging conditions in some
markets. Our solid track record of
improving profitability, combined
with a commitment to operational
excellence and capturing longterm growth, mean we are in a

For example, in China, we completed an expansion at our
Boxing plant – significantly increasing Surface Chemistry’s
regional product portfolio – and boosted production capacity
for dicumyl peroxide (DCP) at our Ningbo multi-site by
40%. We then announced plans to further increase DCP
capacity in Ningbo by another 50% by Q3 in 2018. In North
America, capacity for sodium hydrosulfide was increased in
LeMoyne (US) to meet growing customer demand, while in
Los Reyes (Mexico), we inaugurated a capacity expansion
for the production of organic peroxides. Over in Brazil, we
completed the expansion of the Chemical Island at the
Fibria Três Lagoas site, which is now the largest single pulp
mill in the world.

This activity throughout the year shows that we are
investing all over the world and are continuing to satisfy the
requirements of our customers.
Organic growth is also being stimulated through the
introduction of new products and technologies. I’m
particularly excited by the work being done in our Ethylene

focused businesses, along with new financial guidance, I am
confident that Specialty Chemicals is well positioned to grow
and prosper. We have a highly engaged workforce and we’re
looking forward to a new future.

Looking briefly at how each business performed, Industrial
Chemicals had a strong year, with high capacity utilization
and good margins, while Pulp and Performance Chemicals
also had an excellent 2017 and captured healthy growth
opportunities. Ethylene and Sulfur Derivatives and Polymer
Chemistry benefited from robust demand, and Surface

Chemistry had a satisfactory year, after being held back
by lower activity with regard to shale gas-driven drilling
and oil and gas exploration. Fortunately, our sites suffered
no significant damage due to Hurriance Harvey in the US,
although in Q3 there were disruptions to the manufacturing
and supply chain. Our employees deserve credit for dealing
with the challenges it posed in a positive way. In terms of
continuous improvement, the efficiencies resulting from
the AkzoNobel Leading Performance System (ALPS) ensured
we delivered more from constrained assets.

TURNING GREAT IDEAS
INTO REALITY
It began with more than 200 hopeful start-ups
pitching their bright ideas for sustainable chemistry
solutions – and ended with ten worthy winners
securing a variety of collaboration agreements with
AkzoNobel’s Specialty Chemicals business and
various partners.
In many ways, the company’s inaugural – and hugely successful – Imagine Chemistry start-up challenge has proved to be
just the beginning of an exciting journey for all involved.
Launched in early 2017, start-ups and researchers from
around the world were invited to help solve real-life
challenges faced by our Specialty Chemicals businesses.
Twenty of those who entered were selected to attend the
finals in Deventer, the Netherlands, where over the course of
three days they worked with experts in research, business
and finance to further improve their ideas.
After much deliberation, three start-ups walked away with
joint development agreements to help bring their ideas to
market. Their projects focused on: a sustainable alternative
to polyacrylates, used – among others – to make thickeners
for personal care products; a new process to turn CO2 and
natural gas into key chemicals such as ethylene oxide; and a
solution to create cellulosic products from plant biomass with
the help of pressurized water.
One team also secured a long-term agreement which will
see Specialty Chemicals provide expertise and support
to further develop their idea of scalable, low-cost, postbioreactor dewatering.
Noah Helman of Industrial Microbes – one of the three
joint development agreement winners – summed up the

“WE WANT TO SEE
OUR PRODUCT

AND HELP MAKE
THE WORLD A
BETTER PLACE”
enthusiasm of all the finalists: “Like all the teams, we are
excited and honored to have been selected,” he said.
Added Peter Nieuwenhuizen, Global Research, Development
and Innovation Director for Specialty Chemicals: “We

launched Imagine Chemistry because we wanted to share
in the same infectious enthusiasm for innovation which is
so prevalent in start-ups. And we want our partners to share
in our track record and route to market. We just think there
is so much to be gained by being creative and customerdriven together.
“The challenge is also designed to help us embed open,
collaborative innovation in our ways of working and forge
partnerships with start-ups and others whose ideas
present new opportunities for sustainable growth. We got
off to a great start and are looking forward to working
with the winners to make our industry – and the world –
more sustainable.”
The global challenge proved to be so successful that a
second edition is underway for 2018, when the finals will be
held in Gothenburg, Sweden.

With powder coatings being a relatively
new technology, our business has a
heritage which is decades old rather than
centuries. It has come a long way in a short time,
however.
Our Interpon brand is the global market leader and
the business is growing all the time, evidenced by the
ongoing construction of three new sites. We also acquired
the business of V.Powdertech – the leading Thai manufacturer
of powder coatings – in 2017.
The year also saw the launch of the latest Futura collection, an
extensive range of highly durable and sustainable colors, finishes and
textures which offers architects, designers and developers an exciting new
source of inspiration.

Statement of the
Board of Management
The Board of Management’s
statement on the financial
statements, the management
report and internal controls.
We have prepared the Report 2017, and the undertakings
included in the consolidation taken as a whole, in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS), as adopted by the EU and additional Dutch disclosure
requirements for annual reports.
To the best of our knowledge:
• The financial statements in this Report 2017 give a true
and fair view of our assets and liabilities; our financial
position at December 31, 2017; and the result of our
consolidated operations for the financial year 2017
• The management report in this Report 2017 includes a
fair review of the development and performance of our
businesses and the position of AkzoNobel, as well as the
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a
whole, and describes our principal risks and uncertainties
The Board of Management is responsible for the
establishment and adequate functioning of a system of
governance, risk management and internal controls in our
company. Consequently, the Board of Management has
implemented a broad range of processes and procedures
designed to provide control by the Board of Management
over the company’s operations.
These processes and procedures include measures
regarding the general control environment, such as a Code
of Conduct – including business principles and a corporate
complaints procedure (SpeakUp!) – corporate directives
and authority schedules, as well as specific measures, such
as a risk management system, a system of controls and a
system of letters of financial and non-financial representation
by responsible management at various levels within
our company.

AkzoNobel Report 2017

All these processes and procedures are aimed at providing
a reasonable level of assurance that we have identified
and managed the significant risks of our company,
and that we meet our operational and financial objectives
in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The
individual components of the above set of internal controls
are in line with the COSO Enterprise Risk Management
2017 Framework.
With respect to supporting and monitoring of compliance
with laws and regulations – including our Code of Conduct
– a Compliance Committee has been established. The
Internal Control function maintains AkzoNobel’s Internal
Control Framework, monitors the compliance and includes
updates regarding the emergence of new risks. They support
the annual review of the effectiveness of the system of
governance, risk management and internal controls of the
Board of Management. Internal Audit provides comfort to
the Board of Management, as well as the Supervisory Board,
that our system of risk management and internal controls
– as designed and represented by management – are
adequate and effective.
While we routinely work towards continuous improvement of
our processes and procedures regarding financial reporting,
the Board of Management is of the opinion that:
• The report provides sufficient insights into any failings of
the internal risk management and control systems
• These systems provide reasonable assurance that the
financial reporting does not contain material inaccuracies
• Based on the current state of affairs, it is justified
that the financial reporting is prepared on a going concern
basis
• The report states those material risks and uncertainties
that are relevant to the expectation of the company’s
continuity for the period of 12 months after report
preparation
For a detailed description of the risk management system
and the principal risks identified, reference is made to the
Risk management chapter in the Strategic performance

section, as well as the Compliance and integrity
management chapter of the Governance and compliance
section. We have discussed the above opinion and
conclusions with the Audit Committee, the Supervisory
Board and the external auditor.

Supervisory Board
Chairman’s statement
For AkzoNobel, 2017 was a
landmark year and one of the
most eventful in its long history.
During the year, significant
changes were required to reshape
the company and prepare
for the future. The Supervisory
Board made a substantial
contribution to the new direction
and strategy for AkzoNobel
and was fully focused on ensuring
the company acted in the best
interests of all of its stakeholders,
including shareholders.

The Supervisory Board is convinced AkzoNobel has a
compelling new strategy that will build on the strong
financial foundation which has been put in place in recent
years. Now is the right time to create two focused, high
performing businesses – Paints and Coatings, and Specialty
Chemicals. This logical next step will generate superior value
creation than the alternatives, with substantially fewer risks,
uncertainties and social costs. It will enable AkzoNobel
to thrive, both to the benefit of its shareholders and the
communities in which it operates worldwide.
The unsolicited and non-binding proposals from PPG which
were received during the year were carefully and thoroughly
reviewed, in consultation with our internal and external
financial advisors and legal counsel. The Supervisory Board
and the Board of Management unanimously concluded that
PPG’s proposals undervalued AkzoNobel, failed to reflect
the value-creating opportunities unveiled at the investor
update on April 19, 2017, and were not in the best interest
of the company, its shareholders, employees and other
stakeholders. The Supervisory Board held itself accountable
for its decisions in an Extraordinary General Meeting
held in September. In this meeting, and in many one-onone meetings with shareholders, the company provided a
platform to further explain and discuss our response
to PPG’s proposals. In addition, our decision-making was
scrutinized in court and upheld by the Enterprise Chamber
of the Amsterdam Court of Appeal.
Shareholders subsequently approved the separation of the
Specialty Chemicals business at an EGM held on November
30, 2017. Following this approval, a €1 billion special cash
dividend was paid out in December 2017 as advance
proceeds, which demonstrates AkzoNobel’s commitment to
substantial shareholder returns.

Leadership

AkzoNobel Report 2017

The separation of Specialty Chemicals is being conducted
via a dual-track process (resulting in either a private sale
or legal demerger) and is on track for April 2018. Internal
separation was completed by January 1, 2018. The
Supervisory Board will make the final decision on whether to
proceed with either a legal demerger or a private sale
by assessing various factors, such as value creation and
the interests of all our stakeholders, including shareholders.
The Specialty Chemicals business is in a strong financial
position and well placed to operate as a standalone
business, with excellent opportunities to unlock further value
in the future.
Moving forward, as the paints and coatings industry
continues to consolidate, the company will focus on its
strategy and delivering on the 2020 financial guidance.
On a continuous basis, potential opportunities to grow
and create value through M&A transactions will also
be considered. During 2017, AkzoNobel held constructive
discussions with Axalta about a possible merger, which
ended without agreement. However, the company remains
open to exploring relevant opportunities.
A vital part of achieving the goals and ambitions that have
been set is the company’s sustainability agenda. It remains
fundamental to AkzoNobel’s business strategy and is key
to driving innovation and ensuring that customer needs
and expectations are met – and often exceeded. The
Supervisory Board continues to monitor the company’s
contribution to the UN Sustainable Development Goals
and has a constructive, advisory and analytical role in
overseeing management’s formulation and implementation
of the sustainability agenda. It was therefore pleasing to
see AkzoNobel ranked in first place on the Dow Jones
Sustainability Index in the Chemicals industry when the 2017
list was announced in September (our fifth number one
ranking in six years).

Other management changes during 2017 saw CFO
Maëlys Castella take a leave of absence for health reasons.
She has been an integral part of establishing the solid
financial foundation and culture of operational excellence
that AkzoNobel now has in place. We wish her a speedy
recovery and look forward to welcoming her back in a
senior management role once she is ready to return.
Her successor, Maarten de Vries – who was appointed
CFO as of January 1, 2018 – has more than 25 years
of experience in finance and international business.
We look forward to working with him as we continue to
deliver sustainable growth and value creation for all
our stakeholders.

The Supervisory Board values its relationship with
shareholders and takes its responsibility in this respect
very seriously. During 2017, this relationship was impacted.
A range of additional measures was therefore taken to
improve shareholder relations. These actions – including
a significant number of meetings and calls – sought to
strengthen and maintain a continued and constructive dialog
with our shareholders. In addition, a shareholder survey
was conducted to gather independent and structured
feedback. The company appointed JP Morgan Cazenove as
a special advisor to a newly established Supervisory Board
committee on shareholder relations. The Supervisory Board
and management team look forward to further enhancing the
relationship with AkzoNobel’s shareholders as the company
delivers on its strategy.

Finally, I confirm that I will retire as planned from my position
as Chairman of the Supervisory Board of AkzoNobel when
my third term of office ends in April 2018. I am proud to have
contributed to the company’s progress and development –
particularly during such an historic time – and look
forward to seeing AkzoNobel continue to grow and prosper.
I would like to express my gratitude for the cooperation
and teamwork demonstrated by my fellow Supervisory
Board members throughout my time with the company.
As a Board, we also thank the Board of Management, the
members of the Executive Committee and all employees for
their commitment and hard work during such a busy and
historic year.

Amsterdam, March 7, 2018
Antony Burgmans
Chairman of the Supervisory Board

The transformation of the company has required careful
and informed decision-making. The Supervisory Board
held a total of 38 meetings in 2017 to analyze and discuss
the many developments and was advised by legal counsel
specifically retained by the Supervisory Board to ensure
that our decisions met the highest standards in legal and
corporate governance. I would like to thank my colleagues
on the Supervisory Board for their contribution and
commitment during this intense period.

Financial
information

In Thierry Vanlancker, we have a highly qualified chief
executive who is well placed to continue building momentum
for the company. His extensive experience in the chemicals
and coatings industry provides him with the right background
and qualifications to take AkzoNobel forward into a new era.

We also welcomed three new Supervisory Board members
during the year: Mrs. Sue Clark, Mr. Patrick Thomas and
Mr. Michiel Jaski. They bring with them extensive experience,
knowledge and insight, which will benefit the composition
of our Board moving forward. The Supervisory Board
would also like to thank Ms. Sari Baldauf – who decided
to step down as of December 1, 2017 – for her significant
contribution since being appointed in 2012.

statements

A number of significant appointments were made on an
executive management level during 2017. In September,
shareholders officially approved the appointment of
Thierry Vanlancker as the company’s new CEO, following
Ton Büchner’s departure for health reasons. Ton was an
outstanding leader for AkzoNobel, transforming the company
and setting it up for future success. His focus on delivering
for customers and operational excellence drove profitability
and increased returns to shareholders. Ton’s passion for
the business and personal commitment helped create a
strong culture across the company. He will be greatly missed
in the boardroom and by many AkzoNobel colleagues
around the world. We wish him every success in the future.

Report of the
Supervisory Board
Reference is made to the Timeline on pages 78 and 79,
which sets out key events for AkzoNobel in 2017. In the
context of the extraordinary events it chronicles, the focus
of the Supervisory Board for 2017 has been to consider the
interests of all stakeholders in its decision making.
The Supervisory Board values its relationship with
shareholders and all stakeholders, and takes its responsibility
towards them very seriously. While the Enterprise
Chamber and Amsterdam District Court denied measures
requested by some shareholders in May and July 2017,
the Supervisory Board recognized that relations
with shareholders required improvement and took a range of
measures designed to strengthen and maintain
a constructive dialog.

Such measures included the creation of a Supervisory Board
committee for shareholder relations, with David Mayhew
and the team at JP Morgan Cazenove appointed as
advisors. An Extraordinary General Meeting was convened
on September 8, 2017, when further explanation was
provided regarding AkzoNobel’s response to the unsolicited
and non-binding proposals made by PPG earlier in the year.
In August 2017, following constructive dialog, an
agreement was reached with Elliott Advisors (UK) Ltd.
(Elliott), aimed at normalizing the relationship with Elliott.
A further Extraordinary General Meeting was convened
on November 30, 2017, to consider appointments to the
Board of Management and Supervisory Board, and to obtain
approval for the separation of the Specialty Chemicals
business from AkzoNobel through a private sale or a legal

demerger. In addition, an augmented schedule of roadshows
and conferences contributed to improved relations with
shareholders as the year progressed. Going forward, an
enlarged program of analyst and investor webcasts and
events has been announced which will continue to improve
shareholder relations beyond 2017.
The Supervisory Board will continue to actively engage
with shareholders and all stakeholders in AkzoNobel
to achieve our goal of accelerating sustainable growth
and value creation.

Meetings
The Supervisory Board held eight regular scheduled
meetings and 30 additional meetings during 2017. The
additional meetings were required to ensure the Supervisory
Board was sufficiently informed and could make considered
decisions regarding the exceptional events that occurred
during the year (further details can be found in the Timeline

Strategic
performance

Separation of Specialty Chemicals
During 2017, the Supervisory Board allocated adequate
time to overseeing the separation of Specialty Chemicals.
The separation is following a dual-track process (either for
legal demerger or private sale) and remains on track for
April 2018. Internal separation was completed by January 1,
2018. The Supervisory Board will decide whether to opt
for a legal demerger or private sale on the basis of various
factors, including which method creates most value and
what is in the best interest of our shareholders and other
stakeholders. The Specialty Chemicals business is in a
strong financial position and is well placed to operate as a
standalone business.

Sustainability
Strategy reviews
During 2017, the Supervisory Board continued to allocate
adequate time to discuss strategic activities, in particular
with regard to the events set out in the Timeline on pages 78
and 79. This included detailed Business Area by Business
Area analyses, and the decision to separate Specialty
Chemicals and create two high performing businesses.
The company renewed its efforts to achieve functional
excellence and efficiencies by implementing a transformation
program, pursuant to which a new management structure
was announced. In addition, functional and operational

Sustainability is integral to the company’s business strategy.
For AkzoNobel, this means delivering both short-term
and long-term value for shareholders and all other
stakeholders, because today’s profits are essential to fund
tomorrow’s innovations.
The focus on sustainable product portfolios and resource
productivity is an investment in the future success of
AkzoNobel, motivating and giving pride to employees,
because sustainability is a core principle, defining what the
company is and what it stands for.

Business
performance
Leadership

Over the last 15 years, AkzoNobel has successfully
differentiated itself from its competitors by taking a
pragmatic approach to business sustainability, seeking
to generate more value from fewer resources and to turn
societal concerns and environmental challenges into
product innovations that meet a market need. AkzoNobel
also benchmarked its sustainability processes and earned
stakeholder respect by achieving a clear leadership status in
independent rankings. During 2017, the company returned
to the top of the influential Dow Jones Sustainability Index
(DJSI) to lead the rankings for the fifth time in six years,
being placed first in the Chemicals industry. This represents
a quick and successful response from the company after
its run of four consecutive years at the top was briefly
interrupted in 2016. AkzoNobel’s status as a clear leader
was demonstrated again when the company achieved
the top ranking in the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP)
“Catalyst for Change” report on the chemical industry’s
carbon disclosure transparency.

Governance and
compliance

The table on the left provides an overview of the attendance
record of the individual members of the Supervisory
Board. The Supervisory Board attaches great value to the
attendance of its meetings by each Supervisory Board
member. However, if Supervisory Board members are unable
to attend a Supervisory Board or committee meeting, they
inform the relevant Chairman, stating the reason. They also
have the opportunity to discuss any agenda items with the
relevant Chairman. Attendance is expressed as the number
of meetings attended out of the number eligible to attend.
The Supervisory Board notes the low absenteeism rate from
Supervisory Board and committee meetings in 2017.

At corporate level, the Supervisory Board received
comprehensive market updates, approved the financial
guidance for 2020 for Paints and Coatings in April and
reviewed and approved the company’s strategy to
create two focused businesses with sustainable growth
plans. During the Extraordinary General Meeting held
in November 2017, it was reconfirmed that this strategy
is expected to unlock further value and accelerate
growth for both the Paints and Coatings, and Specialty
Chemicals businesses.

The Supervisory Board reviews sustainability as an intrinsic
value driver in the work of all businesses and all functions.
Likewise, the Sustainability Council – which advises the
Executive Committee on sustainability developments –
contains representatives of every business and function and
is led by the CEO.

During 2017, the Supervisory Board also assessed
the company’s sustainability strategy and targets. The
Supervisory Board is confident that by making sustainability
an explicit differentiator – part of the company’s brand –
AkzoNobel enhanced its value proposition for employees
and business partners. Looking forward, the company will
continue to develop business opportunities in alignment with
the UN Sustainable Development Goals, which are relevant
for the long-term societal needs of each region, creating
more shared value from fewer resources.

on pages 78 and 79). The Board of Management attended
all eight meetings and the vast majority of the 30 additional
meetings. The Executive Committee attended the
majority of the scheduled meetings, while the additional
meetings were mostly held without the Executive Committee
present. Almost all plenary sessions of the Supervisory
Board were preceded or succeeded by an executive session
of the Supervisory Board, with the CEO in attendance.
The Supervisory Board also regularly held executive sessions
without the CEO present. An attendance overview of the

pursued a detailed approach to assessing this performance
during the year. Individual Board of Management and
Executive Committee performance was addressed in
Supervisory Board meetings following recommendations
from the Remuneration Committee. For more details, see the
report of the Remuneration Committee on page 74.
Discussions on corporate performance are held at each
regular Supervisory Board meeting. These discussions
include business reviews and performance updates from
corporate functions. Forward-looking targets were also
addressed in light of these reviews, and both the proposed
budget and operational plan for 2018 were provided for
the Supervisory Board’s review and approval in the final
quarter of the year. The Supervisory Board took a diligent
approach to assessing these plans, taking into account
prevailing market conditions. Following this assessment, the
Supervisory Board has approved the proposed budget and
operational plan for 2018.
During 2017, the Supervisory Board was pleased to see the
company continuing to benefit from management’s strategic
initiatives, including cost reductions through enhanced
efficiencies and operational excellence. This led to profitability
improvements during the year, despite difficult market
conditions and significant supply chain disruptions. The nature
of this performance provided a basis for the Supervisory
Board’s approval of the proposal to increase the dividend for
the year 2017. In addition, a €1 billion special cash dividend
– as advance proceeds from the separation of Specialty
Chemicals – was paid on December 7, 2017. Further details on
the 2017 dividend proposal are provided in the Consolidated
financial statements and profit allocation paragraph.

Risk management
The Supervisory Board views risk management as an
essential mechanism, not only for safeguarding the business
and assets of AkzoNobel, but also for securing versatility
and long-term performance and value creation. Risk
management updates were received throughout the year
as the Supervisory Board sought to assure itself of the

70

Leadership

|

AkzoNobel Report 2017

robustness of the company’s risk mitigation and internal
controls. As an aspect of these assurances, the Supervisory
Board considered the risks related to each of the events
set out in the Timeline published on pages 78 and 79 and
scrutinized related mitigating actions.
The Board of Management and Executive Committee
maintain the risk management framework and system of
internal controls. The company’s governance, risk and
compliance functions support our comprehensive global risk
management processes and facilitate risk workshops. During
the workshops, risk scenarios are prepared and assessed,
including the appropriateness of the controls and mitigation
measures. Implementation of risk mitigating measures for
the key risks, as identified by the Board of Management and
the Executive Committee, is monitored by the Supervisory
Board during the year by means of risk updates and reviews.
Further details are included in the Risk management chapter
in the Strategic performance section.

Corporate governance
Following the implementation of the revised Dutch Corporate
Governance Code (the “Code”) with effect from January 1,
2017, a working group was established – comprising internal
experts from each function – to perform an in-depth review
of the corporate governance framework and systems of
the company in the context of compliance with the Code.
Certain practices were revised and the Supervisory Board
is satisfied the company has complied with the Code on a
“comply or explain” basis. Further details can be found in the
Governance and compliance section.

Talent management and succession planning
Talent management has been a strong focus for the
Supervisory Board in 2017. Throughout the year, the
Supervisory Board discussed and undertook detailed
executive succession planning. The executive talent pool,
which was reviewed and defined in 2016, was used to
ensure that executive level succession plans are in place and
implemented in the new organizational structure.

In July 2017, Mr. Ton Büchner resigned as CEO for health
reasons. The Supervisory Board’s consistent and structured
approach to succession planning allowed the company
to be in a position to announce the appointment of
Mr. Vanlancker as CEO shortly after receiving Mr. Büchner’s
resignation. Upon recommendation from the Nomination
Committee, the Supervisory Board designated
Mr. Vanlancker as CEO and Chairman of the Board of
Management, with full power and authority as a member of
the Board of Management, in accordance with the Articles
of Association of Akzo Nobel N.V., which provides for such
designation until formal CEO appointment by shareholders.
Mr. Vanlancker was formally appointed as a member of the
Board of Management by shareholders at the EGM held on
September 8, 2017.
During 2017, the Supervisory Board also discussed
changes to the composition of the Executive Committee.
The Supervisory Board discussed the re-appointment of
Mr. Werner Fuhrmann to replace Mr. Vanlancker as Executive
Committee member responsible for Specialty Chemicals.
Mr. Fuhrmann was welcomed back to the company in
August 2017 to head up Specialty Chemicals and lead
on the separation. He subsequently resigned from the
Executive Committee on January 2, 2018, due to the internal
separation of Specialty Chemicals. The Supervisory Board
also discussed and supported the CEO’s appointment of
Mr. David Allen as Chief Supply Chain Officer and member
of the Executive Committee.
In August 2017, the CFO, Mrs. Maëlys Castella, resigned
from the Board of Management due to health reasons.
She is now on a leave of absence. The Supervisory Board
appointed the Group Controller, Mr. Hans De Vriese, as
interim CFO and member of the Executive Committee,
which ensured continuity while the search for a CFO began.
Following recommendation from the Nomination Committee,
the Supervisory Board was pleased to nominate
Mr. Maarten de Vries as CFO and member of the Board of
Management with effect from January 1, 2018. Mr. De Vries’

Strategic
performance
Board of AkzoNobel ends in 2018, the Supervisory Board
initiated a search for a new Chairman. The search was
managed by the Nomination Committee, led by
Mr. Byron E. Grote. As per best practice, Mr. Burgmans
did not participate in the Nomination Committee’s work in
this regard. A thorough internal and external search was
conducted, with the assistance of an independent and
well-reputed search firm. The requirements of the Dutch
Corporate Governance Code were considered throughout
the process. Shareholders have been consulted and the
Supervisory Board has nominated the best candidate
for consideration by the shareholders at the Annual General
Meeting of April 26, 2018. For further details, please
refer to the notice of the AGM, which can be found on the
corporate website.

Business
performance

The Supervisory Board also took the time to discuss its
own composition and succession plans in order to ensure
continued effectiveness. Discussions in this regard were
also held with shareholders. These discussions led to the
nominations of Mrs. Sue Clark and Mr. Patrick Thomas in

August 2017, and of Mr. Michiel Jaski in October 2017, as
members of the Supervisory Board. The appointments were
approved at the EGM held on November 30, 2017, and
the new Supervisory Board members have undergone a
comprehensive induction to AkzoNobel – including
one-on-one meetings with the CEO, CFO, and all other
Executive Committee members. As the third term of

held on November 30, 2017.

compliance

The Supervisory Board has updated its skills matrix under
recommendation from the Nomination Committee. The
updated matrix can be found later in this section.

Supervisory Board evaluation

In 2016, the Supervisory Board underwent an evaluation by
means of an external assessment of performance. During
2017, the Supervisory Board continued to improve on
items highlighted during the external evaluation, including
the approach to risk identification, governance structure,
composition, succession and talent management.

Sustainability
statements

Our continued commitment to offering the best conditions for employees was recognized by the Top Employers Institute, with the
company receiving official certification in three of its key markets – Brazil, China (pictured) and the UK. The latest accreditation means
AkzoNobel has now achieved Top Employer status for six years in a row in the UK and five consecutive years in China, while in Brazil it’s
the second year running.

Financial
information

The Supervisory Board continued to engage in its own
ongoing training during the year and received regular
updates on corporate governance and requirements. An
important preparatory aspect of this was the Supervisory
Board evaluation, which provides an assessment of its
effectiveness, that of its committees and its individual
members. In general, this process is undertaken through an
internal evaluation of performance. Once every three years
– unless it determines to do so more frequently – instead of
an internal evaluation, the Supervisory Board undergoes an
independent external assessment facilitated by a specialist
consultant.

71

In addition, during 2017 – as part of the selection process
for the three newly appointed members of the Supervisory
Board – an evaluation of the functioning and composition
of the Supervisory Board, its committees and its individual
members was carried out by the Supervisory Board.
The Supervisory Board believes that these appointments
enhance the performance and effectiveness of the
Supervisory Board.

Financial statements and profit allocation
The financial statements of Akzo Nobel N.V. for the financial
year 2017 were audited by PriceWaterhouseCoopers
Accountants N.V. The Board of Management submitted
the report and financial statements – including the report of
the Board of Management – to the Supervisory Board for
review and approval.
The financial statements, the report and management
letter of the external auditors were discussed by the Audit
Committee extensively with the external auditors, in the
presence of the CFO and by the full Supervisory Board with
the Board of Management and the General Counsel. Based
on these discussions, the Supervisory Board is of the opinion
that the 2017 financial statements of Akzo Nobel N.V. form
an adequate basis to account for the supervision provided
(see the Consolidated financial statements). The Audit
Committee monitors the follow-up by management of the
recommendations made by the external auditors.
The Supervisory Board recommends that the AGM adopts
the financial statements as presented in this Report 2017
and, as proposed by the Board of Management, the
proposed total dividend for 2017 of €2.50 per common
share outstanding. This represents an increase of 52%
over the previous year and the third year in a row where the
Supervisory Board has proposed an increased dividend.
This reflects the continued commitment to the company’s
aim of providing a stable to rising dividend. It is proposed
that this amount, less the interim dividend of €0.56 per
common share – which was paid in November 2017 – be
made payable on May 25, 2018. The dividend will, at

the shareholders’ discretion within the limits and on the
conditions set by the Board of Management, be paid either
in cash or in shares. In addition, we request that the AGM
discharges the members of the Board of Management from
their responsibility for the conduct of business in 2017 and
the members of the Supervisory Board for their supervision
in 2017.
During 2017, the Supervisory Board approved the proposal
of the Board of Management to pay a special cash dividend
of €4.00 per common share outstanding as advance
proceeds from the separation of Specialty Chemicals. The
distribution was paid wholly in cash on December 7, 2017.
Our International brand supplied a bespoke shade of its Toplac paint range for a pilot
boat which escorts solo swimmers and relay teams across the English Channel. Asked
to “think Lady Penelope from Thunderbirds,” our color experts created a specially
formulated pink marine coating which helped the owner of the vessel raise more than
£13,000 for charity.

External audit
PriceWaterhouseCoopers Accountants N.V., AkzoNobel’s
external auditors, reported in-depth to the Audit Committee
on the scope and outcome of the annual audit of the
financial statements, including the consolidated financial
statements and the company financial statements
and report.
The Audit Committee held independent meetings with the
external auditors and critically reviewed and constructively
challenged their audit approach, fees, risk assessment
and audit plan for the year ahead. Other topics discussed
included:
• The hard close, which was discussed with the intention
of improving the efficiency of the year-end process and
to highlight important issues for the annual financial
statements. AkzoNobel performed a hard close as of
October 31, 2017
• The quality of the external audit
• Impact of new accounting rules

In addition, the Audit Committee reviewed the annual
operational plan (including budget) and AkzoNobel’s dividend
proposals. Upon fulfilling its oversight responsibilities in
relation to governance, risk management and internal control
systems, the Audit Committee met regularly with senior
executives. The General Counsel reported regularly to the
Audit Committee on the company’s compliance framework
and compliance matters and activities, and on major
litigation and liability exposures. The Internal Auditor reported
to the Audit Committee on their assessment of the status
of the system of governance, risk management and internal
controls throughout 2017.

Business and function reviews
In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities in relation to risk
management and internal control systems, the
Audit Committee also received updates from functions
throughout the year. These updates also inform the
Audit Committee’s review of the annual operational plan,
including budget.
During the year, updates were provided from Accounting
and Control, Treasury, Investor Relations, Information
management and Tax. The Audit Committee continued
to monitor functional initiatives such as progress on the
company’s cyber-security road map as an aspect of

Business
performance

An important feature of the Audit Committee’s work in 2017
has been its attention to the financial impact of the events
set out in the Timeline on pages 78 and 79. In particular, the
Audit Committee has reviewed and closely monitored the
process for the separation of Specialty Chemicals, including
assessing the associated risks and related mitigating actions
and receiving regular financial updates. The Audit Committee
reviewed and discussed the 2014-2016 Specialty Chemicals
financial statements and demerger accounts. The Audit
Committee is confident the separation process remains on
track for April 2018. With regard to the dual-track process,
the Audit Committee continues to carefully review and
consider the preferred method for separating the Specialty
Chemicals business, and will be involved in the assessment
of the value of the Specialty Chemicals business that can be
unlocked in either a private sale or a legal demerger.

Audit Committee evaluation
Every year, the Audit Committee undergoes an annual
evaluation of its effectiveness and performance. In general,
this process involves the Audit Committee undertaking a
self-evaluation of its performance in conjunction with the
Supervisory Board. Once every three years – unless it is
decided to do so more frequently – the Audit Committee
undergoes an independent external assessment of its
effectiveness and performance, facilitated by a specialist
consultant. In 2016, the Audit Committee underwent an
external evaluation of its effectiveness and performance.
During 2017, the Audit Committee continued to improve
on the areas highlighted by the external assessment,
including its role with regard to cyber-security and the
relationship between the Audit Committee and the Board of
Management.

reviewing the company’s disclosure of potentially price
sensitive information. Based on these discussions, advice
was provided by the Audit Committee to the Supervisory
Board with regard to the publications and disclosures,
and to the interim and final dividends. All quarterly or
annual releases of financial results, and any potentially
price sensitive public disclosures, are approved by the full
Supervisory Board prior to publication and release.
In order to ensure its effectiveness and expertise, the
Audit Committee is provided with regular updates on
IFRS developments and the anticipated impact of
these developments on the financial statements. In
addition, the Audit Committee reviewed and assessed
management assertions made in regard to relevant
accounting treatments.

takes the form of an independent external assessment of the
Remuneration Committee’s effectiveness and performance,
facilitated by a specialist consultant.
In 2016, the Remuneration Committee, together with the
Supervisory Board, underwent an external evaluation. During
2017, the Remuneration Committee continued to improve

performance
In addition, during 2017 the search for a new Chairman
was initiated. Following a thorough internal and external
search, with the assistance of an independent and wellreputed search firm, the Nomination Committee was able to
recommend to the Supervisory Board the nomination of a
strong candidate for consideration by the shareholders at the
Annual General Meeting of April 26, 2018. For further details,
please refer to the notice of the AGM, which can be found
on the corporate website.

All members of the Supervisory Board would like to express
their thanks to the Board of Management and Executive
Committee, as well as to all employees, for their dedication
and hard work for the company during what was an eventful
2017. In particular, the Supervisory Board would like to
extend its sincere gratitude to Mr. Ton Büchner for his service
to AkzoNobel and to wish him the very best for the future.

Talent management and talent pool development
To supplement the Nomination Committee’s discussions
on executive succession, the Nomination Committee was
presented with talent management updates from Human
Resources during the year. Both the Supervisory Board
and the Nomination Committee also continued their work in
defining and identifying a talent pool for future development
and purposes of executive succession planning.

The Supervisory Board has updated its skills matrix, as

The agency employed a rigorous search process after
first gaining a thorough understanding of the culture of
AkzoNobel, its strategic ambitions, the specific leadership
roles and competencies needed to meet those ambitions.
Based on the results of these Nomination Committee
discussions and the work of the external search agency,
the Nomination Committee was able to recommend to the
Supervisory Board the nomination of Mrs. Clark, Mr. Thomas
and Mr. Jaski as new Supervisory Board members at the
EGM of November 30, 2017.

Governance and
compliance

The Nomination Committee’s regular review of the
company’s succession plan allowed the company to be in a
position to announce the appointment of Mr. Vanlancker as
CEO shortly after receiving Mr. Büchner’s resignation. During
2017, following the resignation of Mrs. Castella from the
Board of Management for health reasons, the Nomination
Committee initiated the search for a new CFO. The
Nomination Committee was pleased to recommend to the
Supervisory Board that Mr. Maarten de Vries be nominated
for appointment as CFO and Board of Management
member. Mr. De Vries was appointed as CFO and member
of the Board of Management (effective January 1, 2018) by

(Naamloze Vennootschap) established under the laws of
the Netherlands, with common shares listed on Euronext
Amsterdam. AkzoNobel has a sponsored level 1 American
Depositary Receipt (ADR) program and ADRs can be traded
on the international OTCQX platform in the US.
The company’s management and supervision are organized
under Dutch law in a so-called two-tier system, comprising
a Board of Management, solely composed of executive
directors, and a Supervisory Board, solely composed of
non-executive directors. The Supervisory Board supervises
the Board of Management, and ensures a strong external
presence in the governance of the company. The two
Boards are independent of each other and are accountable
to the Annual General Meeting of shareholders (AGM) for the

AkzoNobel Report 2017

Our corporate governance framework is based on the
company’s Articles of Association, the requirements of
the Dutch Civil Code, the Dutch Corporate Governance
Code (the “Code”), and all applicable laws and regulations,
including securities laws. The Code contains principles
and best practices for Dutch companies with listed shares.
Deviations from the Code are explained in accordance with
the Code’s “comply or explain” principle.
With the exception of those aspects of our governance
which can only be amended with the approval of the AGM,
the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board may
make adjustments to the way the Code is applied, if this
is considered to be in the interest of the company. Where
changes are made, these will be reported and explained in

In 2016, a revised version of the Code was published by
the Corporate Governance Code Monitoring Committee
(website: www.mccg.nl). The revised Code was implemented
with effect from January 1, 2017, and provides for a more
thematically oriented code, with greater focus on culture
and long-term value creation. The company assessed the
changes to the Code by establishing a working group –
comprising internal experts from each function – to perform
an in-depth review of the corporate governance framework
and systems of the company in the context of compliance
with the Code. A gap analysis was carried out by the
working group highlighting certain areas or practices which
required amendment. The gap analysis was reviewed by
the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board and,
upon recommendation from the working group, various
revisions to current practices were implemented where
required. In addition, the revised Code has been reflected
in the Rules of Procedure of the Board of Management and
of the Supervisory Board, which are both available on the

AkzoNobel Report 2017

Supervisory Board or Board of Management members for
appointment. Such nominations require a two-thirds majority,
representing at least 50% of the outstanding share capital in
order to be adopted at an AGM (or EGM).
AkzoNobel believes in the strength of diversity and in
accordance with the Code, a Diversity Policy has been
adopted for the composition of the Board of Management
and Executive Committee. The objective of the Diversity
Policy is to enrich the Board of Management’s perspective,
improve performance, increase member value and enhance
the probability of achievement of AkzoNobel’s goals and
objectives. The Policy addresses concrete targets relating
to diversity, including nationality, age, gender, education and
work background. A consistent and structured approach is
applied to succession planning for the Board of Management
and Executive Committee, taking into account the
implementation of the Diversity Policy. AkzoNobel currently
diverges from the gender target of at least 30% female and
at least 30% male Board of Management members. It is
believed that due to the size and scale of the Board
of Management (being only two members), this divergence
is justified as it has ensured the best candidates for
the roles were nominated by the Supervisory Board and
appointed by shareholders.

Outside directorships
Members of the Board of Management and Executive
Committee are not allowed to hold more than one
supervisory board membership or non-executive directorship
in another listed company. This is more stringent
than the requirements of the Dutch Civil Code, which
allows members of a board of management two such
supervisory board memberships or non-executive
directorships. The exception to this rule is that in the
18 months prior to their retirement, Executive Committee
members are allowed to hold more than one such
supervisory board membership or non-executive directorship
in order to allow them to prepare for retirement, as long as
this does not interfere with the performance of their tasks
as member of the Executive Committee. Furthermore,

During 2017, no transactions were reported under which
a member of the Board of Management or Executive
Committee had a conflict of interest which was of material
significance to the company and to the relevant member.

Remuneration
The remuneration of the members of the Board of
Management is set in line with the remuneration policy
which is adopted by the AGM. The Supervisory Board
is responsible for determining the remuneration of the
members of the Board of Management on the advice of
its Remuneration Committee. The components of Board
of Management remuneration, as well as the remuneration
policy itself, are described in the Remuneration report
and Note 23 of the Consolidated financial statements.
The service contracts of the members of the Board of
Management do contain change of control provisions.
Further details can be found in the Remuneration report.
The service contracts of the Board of Management are
compliant with the Code. The main elements of these
contracts are available on the corporate website.

for decisions to enter into transactions under which Board
of Management or Executive Committee members have a
conflict of interest of material significance to the company
and to the relevant member. Any such decisions involving
members of the Board of Management will be recorded

Operational Control Cycle
To facilitate efficient management and oversight of
operations, the Board of Management and Executive
Committee have established an Operational Control Cycle
(OCC), which is conducted once per month. The format
of the OCC was updated in 2017 to accurately reflect
organizational changes in order to ensure the highest level of
corporate governance is applied throughout the organization.
For the Paints and Coatings business, the OCC consists
of a monthly Business Review Meeting, comprising the CEO,
the CFO, the COO, the Chief Supply Chain Officer
and the leadership of the Paints and Coatings business.
For the Specialty Chemicals business, the OCC consists of
an Operational Review Meeting comprising the CEO, the
CFO and the leadership of the Specialty Chemicals business.

In 2017, the Supervisory Board also established a temporary
committee – the Shareholders Relations Committee.
Its role is to oversee the strengthening of AkzoNobel’s
relationship with shareholders and review relevant feedback
from the investor community. The committee reports on its
deliberations and findings to the full Supervisory Board. The
Shareholders Relations Committee comprises Mr. Verwaayen

The Audit Committee assists the Supervisory Board in
overseeing the quality and integrity of the accounting,
reporting, risk management and internal control practices
of the company, as well as the company’s compliance with
legal and regulatory requirements, the performance of the
Internal Audit function and the qualifications, performance
and independence of the external auditor. The Audit
Committee has a role in assessing the quality and integrity
of reporting on sustainability performance and takes
an active role in reviewing the company’s sustainability
performance data.
As a rule, the CFO, the Group Controller, the Corporate
Director of Internal Audit and the lead partner of the external
auditor attend all regular meetings. After most Audit
Committee meetings, members hold a separate meeting
with only the internal auditor present, a separate meeting
with only the external auditor present and sessions with only
Audit Committee members in attendance. In addition, there
are regular meetings with only Audit Committee members
and the CFO present. Other members of the Executive
Committee attend as and when requested. The General
Counsel reports to the Audit Committee on compliance
matters at every regular Audit Committee meeting and
provides a claim and liability report to the Audit Committee
once a year. The Chairman of the Audit Committee is
primarily responsible for the proper functioning of the Audit
Committee and reports the activities and findings of the
committee to the Supervisory Board, which discusses
these activities and findings when necessary. The Chairman
also initiates the evaluation of the functioning of the Audit
Committee and its individual members, without members of

and supervises the Board of Management on the selection
of senior management. The Nomination Committee also
considers appointments by the CEO of Executive Committee
members who are not also a member of the Board of

and duly signed minutes are made available on the corporate
website within six months after the meeting date.

Share classes
AkzoNobel has three classes of shares: common shares,
cumulative preferred shares and priority shares. Common
shares are traded on the Euronext Amsterdam stock
exchange. Common shares are also traded over-the-counter
on OTCQX in the US in the form of American Depositary
Receipts (each American Depositary Receipt representing
one-third of a common share). On December 31, 2017, a
total of 252,620,585 common shares and 48 priority shares
had been issued. The company has been informed that by
December 31, 2017, MFS Investment Management and
Elliott Advisors (UK) Limited each held more than 5% of the
company’s share capital.
The priority shares are held by the Foundation Akzo Nobel
(Stichting Akzo Nobel). The Foundation’s Board consists
of members of AkzoNobel’s Supervisory Board who are
not members of the Audit Committee. The Meeting of
Holders of Priority Shares has the nomination rights for the
appointment of members of the Board of Management
and the Supervisory Board, as well as the right to approve
amendments to the Articles of Association of the company.
No cumulative preferred shares have been issued to date.
Cumulative preferred shares merely have a financing
function, which means if necessary, and possible, they
will be issued at or near to the prevailing quoted price for
common shares.
The AGM held on April 25, 2017, authorized the Board of
Management for a period of 18 months after that date, or,
if earlier, until the date on which the AGM again extends the
authorization – subject to approval from the Supervisory
Board – to issue shares in the capital of the company free

from pre-emptive rights, up to a maximum of 10% of the
issued share capital, or 20% in case of a merger, acquisition
or strategic alliance. The Board of Management was also
given a mandate to acquire up to a maximum of 10% of the
issued share capital of the company.

Anti-takeover provisions and control
According to the Code, the company is required to provide
an overview of its actual or potential anti-takeover measures,
and to indicate in what circumstances it is expected that
they may be used. The priority shares may be considered
to constitute a form of anti-takeover measure. In relation
to the right of the Meeting of Holders of Priority Shares to
make binding nominations for appointments to the Board
of Management and the Supervisory Board, the Foundation
Akzo Nobel has confirmed that it intends to make use
of such rights in exceptional circumstances only. These
circumstances include situations where, in the opinion of the
Board of the Foundation, the continuity of the company’s
management and policies is at stake. This may be the
case if a public bid for the common shares of the company
has been announced, or has been made, or the justified
expectation exists that such a bid will be made, without any
agreement having been reached in relation to such a bid
with the company. The same shall apply if one shareholder,
or more shareholders acting in a concerted way, hold a
substantial percentage of the issued common shares of
the company without making an offer. Or if, in the opinion
of the Board of the Foundation Akzo Nobel, the exercise of
the voting rights by one shareholder or more shareholders,
acting in a concerted way, is materially in conflict with the
interests of the company. In such cases, the Supervisory
Board and the Board of Management, in accordance with
their statutory responsibility, will evaluate all available options
with a view to serving the best interests of the company,
its shareholders and other stakeholders. The Board of the
Foundation Akzo Nobel has reserved the right to make
use of its binding nomination rights for the appointment
of members of the Supervisory Board and of the Board of
Management in such circumstances.

Although a deviation from provision 4.3.3 of the Code, the
Supervisory Board and the Board of Management are of the
opinion that these provisions will enhance the continuity of
the company’s management and policies.
In the event of a hostile takeover bid, or other action which
the Board of Management and Supervisory Board consider
adverse to the company’s interests, the two Boards reserve
the right to use all available powers (including the right to
invoke a response time in accordance with provisions 4.1.6
and 4.1.7 of the Code), while taking into account the relevant
interests of the company and its affiliate enterprise and
stakeholders.

Auditors
The external auditor is appointed by the AGM on proposal of
the Supervisory Board. The appointment is reviewed every
four years and the results of this review and assessment are
reported to the AGM.
The external auditor attends the majority of Audit Committee
meetings, as well as the meeting of the Supervisory Board
at which the financial statements are adopted. During these
meetings, the auditor discusses the outcome of the audit
procedures and the reflections thereof in the auditors’ report
and the management letter. In particular, the key audit
matters are highlighted. The auditor receives the financial
information and underlying reports of the quarterly figures
and can comment on and respond to this information.
The lead external auditor is present at the AGM and may be
questioned with regard to his statement on the fairness of
the financial statements.

The AkzoNobel internal control framework provides

culture and behaviors.

Business
performance

In accordance with Dutch law and regulations (including the
European Market Abuse Regulation), the company maintains
insider lists and exercises controls around the dissemination
and disclosure of potentially price sensitive information. All
employees and the members of the Board of Management,
the Executive Committee and the Supervisory Board, are
subject to the AkzoNobel Share Dealing Rules, which
limit their opportunities to trade in AkzoNobel securities.
Transactions in AkzoNobel shares carried out by Board of
Management, Executive Committee and Supervisory Board
members (including their closely associated persons) are,
as and when required, notified to the Dutch Authority for the
Financial Markets.

Leadership

The company has strict procedures for internal controls.
The Board of Management and Executive Committee have
established an Internal Control Committee to facilitate and
oversee aspects of these procedures. The Internal Control
Committee monitors the adequacy and effectiveness of
the company’s internal control framework (see diagram

on system-embedded controls, standard role design
and segregation of duty monitoring. The design of the
internal control self-assessment process was adapted to

Internal controls

The Board of Management, Executive Committee and
Supervisory Board members require authorization from the
General Counsel prior to carrying out any transactions in
respect of AkzoNobel securities, even in a so-called “open
period”. In relevant cases, the General Counsel can prohibit
carrying out transactions in respect of other companies’
securities. In addition, all employees, and in particular
members of the Disclosure Committee, are subject to the
AkzoNobel Rules on Disclosure Control.

Financial
information

One area of particular focus in corporate governance is the
independence of the auditors. The Audit Committee has
been delegated direct responsibility for the compensation
and monitoring of the auditors and the services they provide
to the company. Pursuant to the Audit Profession Act, the
auditors are prohibited from providing the company with
services in the Netherlands other than “audit services aimed
at providing reliability concerning the information supplied
by the audited client for the benefit of external users of this
information and also for the benefit of the Supervisory Board,
as referred to in the reports mentioned”. The company
has taken the position that no additional services may be
provided by the external auditor and its global network
that do not meet these requirements, unless local statutory
requirements so dictate. In order to anchor this in our
procedures, the Supervisory Board adopted the AkzoNobel
Rules on External Auditor Independence and Selection and
the related AkzoNobel Guidelines on Auditor Independence.
These documents are available on the corporate website.

Internal controls and risk
management

the changes in the company structure and an integrated
department for Internal Control (IC) was established to
optimize the InControl efforts across all businesses and
functions. This included an IC office to centralize and
standardize guidance, documentation and tooling and
maintain internal and external relationships.

Our risk management system is explained in more detail

Compliance and integrity management
Integrity is one of our core
principles. We are committed to
conducting business in a lawful,
fair and honest way and expect
the same from our business
partners. We have a robust compliance program which is focused
on the risks most material to the
company and its stakeholders.

Risk identification and
prioritization

In 2015, a multi-year compliance strategy was introduced.
As a first step, we launched a new Code of Conduct and a
Business Partner Code of Conduct, as well as relaunching
our SpeakUp! grievance mechanism. In 2016, we enhanced
the compliance organization by establishing more expert
roles and appointing dedicated compliance and privacy
managers and export control officers. We also strengthened
our export control framework and developed a human
rights program. In 2017, we introduced a business partner
compliance program, conducted human rights due diligence
and implemented a standardized process for privacy impact
assessments on high risk personal data processing activities.
Along the way, we further strengthened our integrity
culture and enhanced the use of technology to support our
compliance processes.

Compliance framework

We identify risks through monitoring legal developments,
SpeakUp! grievance investigations, classroom training,
internal control self-assessments, supplier self-assessments,
internal audits, business partner audits and due diligence
in our value chain. Identified risks are assessed through
several processes, including Enterprise Risk Management
(see page 31) and Compliance Risk Review. The latter is
part of the annual Non-Financial Letter of Representation
(NFLoR) process, which results in a review meeting between
the business or functional leader, the Compliance Director,

Governance and organization
The Board of Management and Executive Committee
are responsible for an effective compliance management
framework across all AkzoNobel group entities, and for
maintaining an integrity culture which supports long-term
value creation. The Audit Committee supervises this
responsibility on behalf of the Supervisory Board.

Business and functional leadership is responsible and
accountable for running business operations compliant
with laws and company rules. Each business unit and
large function has a Compliance Committee chaired by
its Managing Director, and has appointed a member of its
management team as its Compliance Officer. This committee
plans to meet quarterly and is responsible for risk assessment
and mitigation, implementation of compliance programs,
ensuring employees are educated and for disciplinary
measures in the event of violation of company rules. The
Compliance Officer manages this on a day-to-day basis.

Compliance function
The Compliance function, led by the Compliance Director –
reporting to the General Counsel – manages the compliance
framework on behalf of the corporate compliance
committees mentioned above. The Compliance function
hosts the Codes of Conduct and Directives Portal, develops
and communicates rules and guidance, manages the
compliance training program, facilitates risk assessment,
performs compliance due diligence, manages investigations,
facilitates compliance self-assessment and reports on
compliance to senior leadership. Its legal experts in the field
of competition law, export control, anti-bribery, privacy and
human rights provide legal advice, training and support. Its
Compliance Managers support the BU/function Compliance
Officers in managing the day-to-day compliance operations
in the businesses and functions.

Communication and education
Our core principles and rules are communicated to
employees in several ways, including a comprehensive
digital training program, classroom training and compliance
communications. Communication and training programs
serve two purposes – to educate employees on the rules
that apply to their role, and to inspire them to apply high
ethical standards in the choices they make.

Strategic
performance
In 2017, we redefined the company’s legal compliance
hard and soft controls and embedded them in the Internal
Control Self-Assessment framework. We also improved
our Directives Portal by adding functionality which shows
the latest rule changes. As a result of our human rights
program, we implemented new rules against discrimination
and harassment in the workplace (see page 186). Additional
guidelines on customer loyalty programs and competition
law were also introduced.

The effectiveness of the Compliance framework is audited by
the Internal Audit function. Following investigations, Internal
Audit may also be engaged to conduct additional reviews to
establish root causes.

Digital training
The Code of Conduct and Life-Saving Rules digital trainings
are mandatory for every employee. Competition law, export
control and sanctions, fraud, anti-bribery, information security
and privacy digital trainings are mandatory for employees
defined on the basis of their role. Digital training completion
is monitored by the BU/function Compliance Committees on
a quarterly basis. Digital trainings are periodically refreshed
to increase engagement. In 2017, we introduced new
digital trainings on information security (more than 38,000
employees) and competition law (over 15,000 employees). At
the end of 2017, the completion rates for Code of Conduct
and Life-Saving Rules were 90% and 87% respectively (82%
and 78% in 2016), while the overall completion rate for all
compliance digital trainings was 85% (82% in 2016).

Governance and
compliance

Our Code of Conduct and Business Partner Code of
Conduct explain our three core principles of safety, integrity
and sustainability to our employees and business partners
and outline what we expect from them. Both are available in
32 languages. The two Codes are supplemented by internal
rules and procedures – which are available to employees in
our Directives Portal – and by agreements with our business
partners. Employees are asked to confirm compliance with
the Code of Conduct as part of their annual performance
evaluation and business partners are asked to sign our
Business Partner Code of Conduct or show they apply
similar business principles.

Internal Audit

The Executive Committee has appointed four corporate
committees to oversee our compliance efforts: the Corporate
Compliance Committee, the Sensitive Country Committee,
the Human Rights Committee and the Privacy Committee.
These committees consist of senior leaders from different
disciplines in the organization, and meet on a quarterly basis.
They each establish, monitor and assess the frameworks
for which they are responsible. Their composition and
responsibilities are explained on our corporate website.

Communication
The Compliance function issues newsletters and holds
WebEx sessions on a quarterly basis. Bulletins on specific
items of interest are also issued, and in 2017, subjects
covered in these bulletins included conflict of interest,
customer loyalty programs and privacy. In addition, the
Compliance function started communicating (anonymized)
examples of investigated violations and disciplinary sanctions
through its newsletter. It also ensured that the importance
of compliance was reflected in a variety of senior leadership
business messages.

Compliance portal
A comprehensive Compliance web portal is available to
employees containing guidance, templates and references
on various compliance topics.

Screening and monitoring
We use several processes and tools to screen employees,
business partners, activities and acquisition targets,
supported by technology where possible. In 2016, we
introduced an export control and sanctions screening
tool across our businesses. This alerts us in the event of
potentially sanctioned parties, sanctioned use or export
license requirements. Use of this tool was expanded in 2017.
We also introduced a business partner screening process
and tool in 2017. This requires high risk business partners
– including key suppliers, parties in sanctioned countries,
agents and toll manufacturers – to be screened for past
violations and misconduct. Using the same tool, we also
introduced a standardized process for the compliance
screening and due diligence of acquisition targets and joint
arrangement partners. In addition, we introduced a process
and tool for assessing personal data processing activities
for privacy compliance and documenting these activities in
anticipation of the EU General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR), which comes into force in 2018.

AkzoNobel Report 2017

Compliance of our operations and business partners is
monitored in several ways. As part of the annual internal
control self-assessment, compliance controls are tested and
deficiencies are reported to higher management through the
Internal Control Self-Assessment tool. In 2017, we enhanced
the compliance controls in this tool and improved the logging
and tracking of compliance-related actions. As a member of
the Together for Sustainability platform, our key suppliers are
monitored through the Ecovadis self-assessment program
and through audits. We implemented amnesty programs for
the acquired BASF Industrial Coatings and Disa Technology
businesses, providing training to employees and urging them
to inform us about past potential competition law violations.

Grievance and investigations
Our SpeakUp! grievance mechanism offers employees,
business partners and members of the general public a
confidential environment in which they can raise concerns
relating to compliance with our Code of Conduct. We
offer anonymous reporting and apply strict principles of
confidentiality and non-retaliation. Reports are investigated
on their merits, in accordance with investigation procedures
that are available to everyone on our corporate internal
and external websites. The investigations are conducted or
managed by dedicated resources supervised by the Head of
Investigations. Findings and recommendations are reported
to the relevant Compliance Committee for decision-making.
In 2017, we introduced sanction guidelines to further
improve the consistency of decision-making.

In 2017, Transparency International Netherlands studied
the whistleblowing frameworks of 18 large Dutch
listed companies. AkzoNobel’s whistleblowing framework
ranked second.

the Competition Law Compliance Declaration process.
This reminds them of the rules and invites them to disclose
any concerns. In 2017, the declaration was preceded by
the launch of our new digital training and various other

In 2017, over 12,000 employees signed the declaration.

Performance of managers and executives is incentivized and
measured in that one of the leadership behaviors against

core principles. For executives, a portion of the long-term
incentive is dependent on the company’s performance in
the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI), which includes
evaluation of Code of Conduct and human rights practices.
In 2017, AkzoNobel regained its number one ranking in
the Chemical industry on the DJSI. The scores on Code

reported up through the process and tool. This information,
along with audit findings, investigation data and test
results from the Compliance function, informed the BU and
functional leaders of material risks, deficiencies and areas for

NFLoR statements, and the BU/function Compliance Risk
Review results, were discussed at the NFLoR review meeting
between the BU/function leader, the Compliance Director,
Legal Director and the responsible Executive Committee
member. The Executive Committee member then reported
the results to the CEO and the General Counsel. The
overall results were reported to the Executive Committee,
Supervisory Board and internal and external auditor as
part of the year-end Compliance Report. The results of this
NFLoR process, in combination with the Internal Control
Self-Assessment process and the internal audit results, form
a basis for the Statement of the Board of Management in
this Report 2017. Reported areas of attention include the
need for additional competition law training to mitigate risk
resulting from increased profit targets, environmental law
developments and enforcement in China, external fraud
attempts and cyber-attacks and preparing for the GDPR.

We measure the integrity culture in several ways. In 2017,
we implemented compliance questions in our recruitment
standards to better assess new recruits against AkzoNobel’s
ethical standards. To measure employee engagement, we
have introduced pulse surveys, periodically inviting large
groups of employees to answer a variety of questions. These
include questions relating to compliance to measure the
integrity culture. The results will feed into our compliance and
audit programs.

Remuneration report
This report describes our
remuneration policy and the
remuneration paid to members
of the Board of Management
in 2017.

The remuneration and individual contracts of the members
of the Board of Management are determined by the
Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board makes these
determinations within the framework of our remuneration
policy, which is approved by our shareholders. Our
remuneration policy – including all structures and policies
related to the remuneration and employment contracts
of the Board of Management members – is in line with
the Code.
The first part of this report describes the remuneration policy
as it has been adopted by our shareholders over time, while
the second part describes the implementation of the policy
in 2017. The remuneration policy was first adopted by the
Annual General Meeting of shareholders (AGM) in 2005
and has since been amended several times, most recently
in 2016. The performance share plan for the Board of
Management was approved by the AGM in 2004. This plan
has been amended several times by the AGM, in accordance
with Article 135 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code, most
recently in 2013. The share-matching plan for the Board of
Management was approved by the AGM in 2011.

Remuneration policy
Our remuneration policy has the objective of providing
remuneration in a form which will attract, retain and engage
members of the Board of Management as top managers of a
major international company, while protecting and promoting
the company’s objectives. The design of the remuneration
structure supports both our short and long-term objectives,
whereas the emphasis is on long-term value creation. The
remuneration policy for the Board of Management is aligned
with the executive remuneration policy of the company
overall. Our policy seeks to provide market competitive
remuneration, where we use the median level of the external
market as a reference point.
The remuneration of the members of the Board of
Management consists of the following elements:

96

Governance and compliance

|

AkzoNobel Report 2017

• Base salary
• Performance-related short-term incentive (STI), with sharematching opportunity
• Performance-related long-term incentive (LTI) in the form
of shares
• Post-contract benefits
• Other benefits
The various elements of the remuneration package are set
out in more detail below.

Base salary
The base salary is determined by the Supervisory Board.

Short-term incentive
The target STI is 100% of base salary for the CEO and
65% of base salary for any other member of the Board of
Management. The STI is linked to financial targets (70%)
and to individual and qualitative targets of the members of
the Board of Management (30%). Targets are determined
annually by the Supervisory Board. In respect of the financial
targets, the Supervisory Board chooses three to four
financial metrics and determines their relative weighting from
the following list:
• Revenue growth
• Operating cash flow (OCF)
• EBITDA
• Return on investment (ROI)
• Net income (to shareholders) • EBIT
• Operating income (OPI)
These metrics are as used or defined in the company’s
annual report, subject to minor adjustments if
required, in order to provide a better indicator of
management’s performance.
For each target, the Supervisory Board sets performance
ranges each year. These performance ranges determine
for each target and relevant part of the STI: (i) The
performance level below which no payouts are made; (ii)
The performance level at which 100% payout is made; and
(iii) The performance level at which the maximum payout
of 150% is made. STI awards in aggregate will not exceed

Strategic
performance
For each of these performance criteria, the minimum vesting
is zero percent and the maximum vesting is 150% of the
relevant part of the conditional share grant. Peer groups and
vesting schemes are determined by the Supervisory Board.

The ratio between fixed and performance-based
compensation (pay mix) for the CEO, under various levels of
performance, is illustrated below. The fixed pay component
only refers to base salary, excluding post-contract benefits
and other benefits. The variable component includes the
aforementioned short-term incentive, long-term incentive and
share-matching feature. Share price developments are not
taken into account.

Board members who continue to invest their short-term
incentives in whole, or in part, in shares after the minimum
holding requirement has been achieved, will have the
opportunity to have such shares matched subject to the
same conditions. However, such shares will be matched with
one share to every two shares thus acquired, and no shares
will be matched to the extent that shares were purchased

Other benefits

Post-contract benefits
Members of the Board of Management receive a contribution
towards pension and similar retirement benefits, as
determined by the Supervisory Board.

Other benefits – such as a company car and allowances –
are determined by the Supervisory Board.

Claw back and value adjustment
The variable pay components are subject to the claw back
and value adjustment provisions of the Dutch Civil Code.

CEO target pay mix 2017 in %
Fixed pay

Variable pay

Shareholding requirements and share-matching
The CEO is required to build up, over a five-year period
from the date of first appointment, at least three times his
gross base salary in AkzoNobel shares and hold these
shares for the duration of his tenure as a member of the
Board of Management. For any other member of the Board
of Management, this requirement is at least one time their
gross base salary.

Leadership

Pay mix
Board members who have not yet achieved their minimum
shareholding are required to invest one-third of their
short-term incentive (net after tax and other deductions) in
AkzoNobel shares. As further encouragement to build up
the minimum holding requirement, Board members who
invest up to a second third of their short-term incentive in
shares will have such shares matched by the company, one
on one, after three years, on the condition that the Board
member still holds these shares and showed a sustained
performance during the three-year period, as determined by
the Supervisory Board. The retention period for the matching
shares expires two years after these shares have been
awarded.

Financial
information

The LTI consists of performance-related shares. Under the
performance share plan, shares are conditionally granted
to the members of the Board of Management. Vesting
of these shares is conditional on the achievement of
performance targets during a three-year period. Achievement
of the performance targets is determined by the Supervisory
Board in the first quarter of the year following the threeyear performance period. The number of vested shares is
adjusted for dividends paid over the three-year performance
period. The retention period for the shares expires five years
after the conditional grant. The long-term incentive plan is
subject to three performance criteria:
• 35% of the conditional grant of shares is dependent
on AkzoNobel’s relative total shareholder return (TSR)
performance compared with companies in a defined peer
group
• 35% of the conditional grant of shares is dependent on
the development in ROI during the performance period
• 30% of the conditional grant of shares is dependent on
AkzoNobel’s relative sustainability performance, measured
as the company’s average position in the DJSI ranking
during the three-year performance period

The company does not grant loans, advance payments or

Implementation of the
remuneration policy in 2017
The Supervisory Board is responsible for ensuring that the
remuneration policy, and its implementation, are aligned with
the company’s objectives. Both the policy itself, and the
checks and balances applied in its execution, are designed to
avoid incidents where members of the Board of Management
– and senior executives for whom similar incentive plans
apply – act in their own interest, take risks that are not in line
with our strategy and risk appetite, or where remuneration
levels cannot be justified in any given circumstance.
To ensure remuneration is linked to performance, a significant
proportion of the remuneration package is variable and
dependent on the short and long-term performance of the
individual Board member and the company. Performance
targets must be realistic and sufficiently stretching. In
addition, and particularly with regard to the variable
remuneration components, the Supervisory Board ensures
that the relationship between the chosen performance
criteria and the strategic objectives applied – as well as the
relationship between remuneration and performance – are
properly reviewed and accounted for both ex-ante and
ex-post.
Before setting proposed targets for Supervisory Board
approval, the Remuneration Committee carried out scenario
analyses of the possible financial outcomes of meeting target
levels, as well as maximum performance levels, and how they
may affect the level and structure of the total remuneration of
the members of the Board of Management. In addition, the
pay ratios are taken into account, comparing the on-target,
annualized total compensation of the CEO with the average
employee compensation.

Short-term incentive
The objectives of the short-term incentive in 2017 were
to reward performance on ROI, EBIT, OCF and revenue
growth; to measure individual and collective performance;
and to encourage progress in the achievement of
long-term strategic objectives. On the outcome of the
short-term incentive elements (ROI, EBIT, OCF, revenue
growth and personal targets), the Supervisory Board
applied a reasonableness test in which the actual level
of the performance was critically assessed in light of the
assumptions made at the beginning of the year. The test
also included an assessment of the progress made with the
strategic objectives under prevailing market conditions.
For 2017, the targets for ROI, EBIT, OCF and revenue growth
were determined by the Supervisory Board. Qualitative STI
targets were set and assessed by the Supervisory Board in
the context of the medium-term objectives of the company.
AkzoNobel does not disclose all qualitative targets, as they
are considered commercially sensitive information. However,
the targets for 2017 included goals set in relation to
delivering on the company’s communicated strategy.

AkzoNobel’s ROI performance at the end of the performance
period was reviewed by the Supervisory Board and adjusted
for currency effects and exceptional items. This resulted in a
vesting of 73% for this part of the long-term incentive.
For the 2015 conditional grant, 30% was linked to
AkzoNobel’s relative sustainability performance by taking the
company’s average position in the DJSI ranking. The following
vesting scheme has been applied in respect of the conditional
grants made in 2015:

With regards to the qualitative targets, the CEO,
Mr. Vanlancker, performed above target.

Long-term incentives

Rank

The objectives of our long-term incentive plan are to
encourage long-term sustainable economic and shareholder
value creation – both absolute and relative to competitors
– and to align Board of Management interests with those
of shareholders, as well as ensuring retention of the
members of the Board of Management. Performance-related
shares are considered to provide a strong alignment with
shareholders’ interests.
Performance share plan
In line with the remuneration policy, vesting of 35% of the
shares conditionally granted is linked to AkzoNobel’s ROI
performance. For the shares conditionally granted in 2015
under the performance share plan (in respect of which the
performance period ended on December 31, 2017), the
Supervisory Board set the ROI to be achieved by the end of
2017 as follows:

The implementation of the remuneration policy in 2017 will
be a separate agenda item at the 2018 AGM.

EBIT was calculated as the number reported for IFRS
purposes, in constant currencies. OCF was calculated as
EBITDA minus the change in operating working capital and
minus capital expenditures, all in constant currencies. The
revenue growth target was defined as the total revenue
change versus the previous year, corrected for divestments
and acquisitions, in constant currencies. In 2017, the
performance against the targets set for ROI, EBIT, OCF,
revenue growth and qualitative targets was as follows:

AkzoNobel’s sustainability performance during the period
2015 to 2017 resulted in a vesting of 100% for this part of the
long-term incentive.
For the 2015 conditional grant, the remaining 35% was
linked to AkzoNobel’s relative total shareholder return (TSR)
performance compared with the companies in a defined
industry peer group. Independent external experts conducted
an analysis to calculate the number of shares that will vest
according to the TSR ranking. In order to adjust for changes
in exchange rates, all local currencies were converted into

absence for health reasons. As such, no leaving arrangement
is in place. Mr. Vanlancker was designated as CEO on
July 19, 2017, and his remuneration is accounted for

euros. The relative TSR performance was compared with an
industry peer group as determined by the Supervisory Board.
The industry peer group currently consists of the following
companies:
• Arkema
• PPG Industries
• DuPont
• RPM Industrial
• Kansai Paint
• Sherwin-Williams
• Kemira OYJ
• Solvay
• Nippon Paint
• Valspar Corporation
This industry peer group is reviewed on a regular basis to
ensure that the companies in the group remain appropriate
peers. Occasionally, changes need to be made, particularly
if one of the companies in the industry peer group is taken
over. The Supervisory Board will monitor and ensure that, to
the extent reasonably possible, a replacement has no impact
on the company’s relative TSR ranking. During 2017, DuPont
merged with Dow Chemical, while Valspar Corporation
has been acquired by Sherwin-Williams. As the remaining
performance period was relatively short, it was decided to
measure their TSR performance until the day of delisting and
then move with the average of the remaining peers.

Our high performance coatings helped power the Eindhoven University of Technology
team to victory in the 2017 World Solar Challenge. Their vehicle, Stella Vie, won the
Cruiser class in the 3,000-kilometer event held in Australia.

AkzoNobel’s TSR performance during the period 2015 to
2017 resulted in fifth position within the ranking of the peer
group companies. This ranking resulted in a vesting of 75%
for this part of the long-term incentive.
Based on the company’s combined ROI, sustainability
and TSR performance, the final vesting percentage of
the 2015 conditional grant – after including the dividend
yield during the performance period (determined to be
13.27%) – equaled 92.65%. Upon its ex-post review of
the relationship between the chosen performance criteria
and the strategic objectives applied, and of the relationship
between remuneration and performance, the Supervisory
Board – given the importance of the link between the
variable remuneration and the company’s strategic ambitions
– decided not to make any correction in respect of the
definitive award.
The number of performance-related shares conditionally
granted under the 2017 plan amounted to 27,300 for the
CEO, Mr. Vanlancker.
The number of shares to be conditionally granted to
members of the Board of Management is determined by

the Supervisory Board, within the limits of the remuneration
policy and the maximum number of shares as adopted and
approved, respectively, by the AGM. The Supervisory Board
has decided that in case of a change in control, the payout
under the performance share plan will be 100% of all shares
conditionally granted. This does not affect the discretion the
Supervisory Board has to correct the variable remuneration
of the Board of Management upwards or downwards in
exceptional circumstances.

Pay ratio
Pay ratios are taken into account, comparing the on-target,
annualized total compensation of the CEO, Mr. Vanlancker,
to the average employee compensation. The ratio is 58.6.
The pay ratio would have been lower if calculated at the
actual compensation granted to the CEO in 2017 due to the
limited term in his new position.

Claw back and value adjustment
In 2017, there was no cause for a claw back or value
adjustment by the Supervisory Board.

Shareholding requirements and share-matching
The table below summarizes the shares acquired by the
relevant members of the Board of Management in 2017 that
would, subject to the conditions of the share-matching plan,
qualify for matching by the company. See also Note 23 of the

Board contracts
Agreements for members of the Board of Management are
concluded for a period not exceeding four years. After the
initial term, reappointments may take place for consecutive
periods of up to four years each. The notice period
by the Board member and by the company shall be subject
to a six-month term. Members of the Board of
Management normally retire in the year they reach the legal
retirement age.

Post-contract compensation
The members of the Board of Management receive
contributions towards post-contract benefits, which are
defined as a percentage of income as determined by the
Supervisory Board. Currently, they are based on age. The

Remuneration policy for the next financial year
The Supervisory Board closely monitors whether the policy
and its implementation are in line with the objectives of the
company. The metrics applied for the STI in 2017 were ROI,

EBIT, OCF, and revenue growth. In 2018, to align with our
strategy, the Supervisory Board intends to add return on
sales (ROS) to the list of financial metrics, from which the
Supervisory Board annually chooses up to four financial
metrics and determines their relative weighting.

Financial
information

At year-end 2017, the CEO, Mr. Vanlancker, held 460
shares, which is compliant with the remuneration policy’s
shareholding requirement, as he has a five-year period
from the date of his first appointment to build up his full
shareholding requirement.

contributions are paid over the base salary in the current
year. The contributions will therefore vary depending on the
age of the Board member.

For 2018, the Supervisory Board envisages choosing
ROS and OCF, as these are identified in our strategic plan.
The targets and ranges have been set at a challenging
level, based on the company’s strategic goals formulated
during the year.
For the LTI, the Supervisory Board will review the current
performance criteria that apply to the performance share
plan and align them with our long-term strategic plan.
The proposal for adjustment will be presented for approval
at the 2018 AGM.

The origins of our Pulp and Performance Chemicals business can be traced
all the way back to the late 1800s, when
Alfred Nobel helped fund the setting up of an
electro-chemical company in Sweden.
Fast forward a century or so and the business is a world
leader in developing and delivering customized bleaching
chemicals and systems, as well as colloidal silica solutions,
expandable microspheres, and porous silica for purification of
pharmaceuticals.
Six new product applications were launched and commercialized
in 2017 within product brands for Levasil (colloidal silica), Expancel
(expandable microspheres) and Kromasil. They will spur growth in catalysts,

Note 1: Summary of significant accounting policies

General information

Consolidation

Akzo Nobel N.V. is a company headquartered in the Netherlands. The address of our registered office is Christian
Neefestraat 2, Amsterdam. We have filed a list of subsidiaries, associated companies and joint ventures, drawn
up in conformity with Article 379 and 414 of Book 2 of the
Dutch Civil Code, with the Trade Registry of Amsterdam.

The Consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Akzo Nobel N.V. and its subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are companies over which Akzo Nobel N.V. has
control, because it is exposed, or has rights, to variable
returns from its involvement with the subsidiary and has
the ability to affect returns through its power over the
subsidiary. Non-controlling interests in equity and in results
are presented separately.

We have prepared the Consolidated financial statements
of Akzo Nobel N.V. in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union. They also comply with the financial reporting
requirements included in Title 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch
Civil Code, as far as applicable. The Consolidated financial
statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
The Management report within the meaning of Article 391
of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code consists of the following
parts of the annual report:
• AkzoNobel at a glance
• How AkzoNobel performed in 2017
• How AkzoNobel created value in 2017
• CEO statement
• Strategic performance
• Leadership: Statement of the Board of Management
• Governance and compliance: Corporate
governance statement
• Governance and compliance: Remuneration report
• Financial information: Note 4 Operating income
• Financial information: Note 24 Financial
risk management
The section Strategic performance provides information on the developments during 2017 and the results.
This section also provides information on cash flow and
net debt, capital expenditures, innovation activities and
employees.
On March 7, 2018, the Board of Management authorized
the financial statements for issue. The financial statements
as presented in this report are subject to adoption by the
Annual General Meeting of shareholders.

AkzoNobel Report 2017

Change in accounting policies
Accounting pronouncements, which became effective for
2017, such as amendments to IAS 7 “Cash flow statement”, IAS 12 “Income tax” as well as IFRS 12 “Disclosure
of interests in other entities”, had no material impact on
our Consolidated financial statements.

Discontinued operations (Note 2)
A discontinued operation is a component of our business that represents a separate major line of business or
geographical area of operations that has been disposed
of or is held for sale/held for distribution, or is a subsidiary
acquired exclusively with a view to resale. Assets and
liabilities are classified as held for sale if it is highly probable
that the carrying value will be recovered through a sale
transaction within one year rather than through continuing
use. Assets and liabilities are classified as held for distribution if it is highly probable that the carrying value will be
recovered through a legal demerger transaction within one
year rather than through continuing use. When reclassifying assets and liabilities as held for sale/held for distribution, we recognize the assets and liabilities at the lower of
their carrying value or fair value less selling costs. Assets
held for sale/held for distribution are not depreciated and
amortized but tested for impairment.
In case of discontinued operations, the comparatives in
the Statement of income are represented. The balance

Strategic
performance

Use of estimates
The preparation of the financial statements in compliance
with IFRS requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in
the financial statements. The estimates and assumptions
are based on experience and various other factors that
are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances
and are used to judge the carrying values of assets and
liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed
on an ongoing basis. The most critical accounting policies
involving a higher degree of judgment and complexity in
applying principles of valuation and for which changes in
the assumptions and estimates could result in significantly
different results than those recorded in the financial statements are the following:
• Scope of consolidation (Note 2)
• Discontinued operations and held for sale (Note 2)
• Income tax and deferred tax assets (Note 7)
• Impairment of intangible assets and property, plant and
equipment (Note 9, 10)

Operating segments
We determine and present operating segments (Business
Areas) based on the information that is provided to the
Executive Committee, our chief operating decision-maker
during 2017, to make decisions about resources to be
allocated to the Business Area and assess its performance. Business Area results reported to the Executive
Committee include items directly attributable to a Business
Area as well as those items that can be allocated on a
reasonable basis. Unallocated items comprise mainly
corporate assets and corporate costs and are reported in
Business Area “Corporate and other”.

Foreign currencies

Foreign currency differences arising on the re-translation
of a financial liability designated as an effective hedge
of a net investment in a foreign operation are recognized
in the cumulative translation reserve (in Other comprehensive income).

Exchange rates of key currencies
The principal exchange rates against the euro used in
preparing the balance sheet and the statement of
income are:
Balance sheet

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into
the functional currency using the foreign exchange
rate at transaction date. Monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies are translated into
the functional currency using the exchange rates at the
balance sheet date. Resulting foreign currency differences
are included in the statement of income. Non-monetary
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are
translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate
at acquisition date.

Business
performance

Foreign exchange differences resulting from translation into
the functional currency of investments in subsidiaries and
of intercompany loans of a permanent nature with other
functional currencies are recorded as a separate component (cumulative translation reserve) within Other comprehensive income. These cumulative translation adjustments
are reclassified (either fully or partly) to the statement of
income upon disposal (either fully or partly) or liquidation
of the foreign subsidiary to which the investment or the
intercompany loan with a permanent nature relates to.

Leadership

We have used the indirect method to prepare the statement of cash flows. Cash flows in foreign currencies
have been translated at transaction rates. Acquisitions or
divestments of subsidiaries are presented net of cash and
cash equivalents acquired or disposed of, respectively.
Cash flows from derivatives are recognized in the statement of cash flows in the same category as those of the
hedged items.

Governance and
compliance

Until 2016, AkzoNobel used the term Incidental items
to refer to material items of income or expense. As from
2017, AkzoNobel has changed this term from Incidental
items to Identified items. These Identified items (Alternative Performance Measures (APM) adjustments) relate
to material items of income and expense arising from
circumstances outside the normal course of business,
such as acquisitions/divestments, realignment of strategy,
impairments and legal items.

Statement of cash flows

The assets and liabilities of entities with other functional currencies are translated into euros, the functional
currency of the parent entity, using the exchange rates at
the balance sheet date. The income and expenses of entities with other functional currencies are translated into the
functional currency, using the exchange rates at transaction date.

Revenue recognition
Revenue is defined as the revenue from the sale and
delivery of goods and services and royalty income, net of
rebates, discounts and similar allowances, and net of sales
tax. Revenue is recognized when the significant risks and
rewards have been transferred to a third party, recovery of
the consideration is probable, the associated costs and
possible return of goods can be estimated reliably and
there is no continuing management involvement with the
goods. For revenue from sales of goods these conditions are generally met at the time the product is shipped
and delivered to the customer, depending on the delivery
conditions. Service revenue is generally recognized as
services are rendered.

Post-retirement benefits
(Note 5, 16)
Contributions to defined contribution plans are recognized
in the statement of income as incurred.
Most of our defined benefit pension plans are funded with
plan assets that have been segregated in a trust or foundation. We also provide post-retirement benefits other than
pensions to certain employees, which are generally not
funded. Valuations of both funded and unfunded plans are
carried out by independent actuaries based on the
projected unit credit method. Post-retirement costs primarily represent the increase in the actuarial present value of
the obligation for projected benefits based on employee
service during the year and net interest on the net defined
benefit liability/asset. When the calculation results in a
benefit to AkzoNobel, the recognized asset is limited to the
present value of economic benefits available in the form
of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future
contributions to the plan. An economic benefit is available
if it is realizable during the life of the plan, or on the settlement of the plan liabilities. The effect of these so-called
asset ceiling restrictions and any changes therein is recognized in Other comprehensive income. Remeasurement
gains and losses, which arise in calculating our obligations,

114

Financial information

|

AkzoNobel Report 2017

are recognized in Other comprehensive income. When the
benefits of a plan improve, the portion of the increased
benefits related to past service by employees is recognized as an expense in the statement of income immediately. We recognize gains and losses on the curtailment or
settlement of a defined benefit plan when the curtailment
or settlement occurs.
Net interest on the net defined benefit liability is included
in financing expenses related to post-retirement benefits.
Other charges and benefits recognized are reported in
Operating income, unless recorded in Other comprehensive income.

Other employee benefits
(Note 5, 17)
Provisions for other long-term employee benefits are
measured at present value, using actuarial assumptions
and methods. Any actuarial gains and losses are recognized in the statement of income in the period in which
they arise.

Share-based compensation
(Note 5)
We have a performance-related share plan and a sharematching plan, under which shares are conditionally
granted to certain employees. The fair value is measured
at grant date and amortized over the three-year period
during which the employees normally become unconditionally entitled to the shares with a corresponding
increase in shareholders’ equity. Amortization is accelerated in the event of earlier vesting.

Income tax (Note 7)
Income tax expense comprises both current and deferred
tax, including effects of changes in tax rates. In determining the amount of current and deferred tax we also take
into account the impact of uncertain tax positions and
whether additional taxes and interest may be due. Income
tax is recognized in the statement of income, unless
it relates to items recognized in Other comprehensive
income or equity.
Current tax includes the expected tax payable and receivable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates
enacted or substantially enacted at reporting date, as well
as (any adjustments to) tax payable and receivable with
respect to previous years.
Deferred tax is recognized using the liability method on
temporary differences arising between the tax bases of
assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the
Consolidated financial statements. We do not recognize
deferred tax for the initial recognition of goodwill, the
initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither
accounting nor taxable profit, and differences related to
investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will
probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax
assets are recognized for unused tax losses, tax credits
and deductible temporary differences, to the extent that
it is probable that future taxable profits will be available
against which they can be utilized.
Measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities is
based upon the enacted or substantially enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which
temporary differences are expected to be reversed. Nonrefundable income tax is taken into account in the determination of deferred tax liabilities to the extend earnings are
expected to be distributed by subsidiaries in the foreseeable future and AkzoNobel has control over dividend
distribution. Deferred tax positions are not discounted.

Strategic
performance

Government grants
Government grants related to costs are deducted from
the relevant costs to be compensated in the same period.
Government grants to compensate for the cost of an asset
are deducted from the cost of the related asset. Emission
rights granted by the government are recorded at cost. A
provision is recorded if the actual emission is higher than
the emission rights granted.

Intangible assets (Note 9)
Intangible assets are valued at cost less accumulated
amortization and impairment charges. Intangible assets
with an indefinite useful life, such as goodwill and certain
brands, are not amortized, but tested for impairment annually using the value in use method. Goodwill in a business
combination represents the excess of the consideration
paid over the net fair value of the acquired identifiable
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. If the cost of an
acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of
the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognized directly in the statement of income. The effects of all transac-

Property, plant and equipment are valued at cost less
accumulated depreciation and impairment charges. Costs
include expenditures that are directly attributable to the
acquisition of the asset, including borrowing cost of capital
investment projects under construction.
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method,
based on the estimated useful life of the asset components. The useful life of plant equipment and machinery
generally ranges from ten to 25 years, and for buildings
ranges from 20 to 50 years. Land is not depreciated. In
the majority of cases residual value is assumed to be insignificant. Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual
values are reassessed annually.
Costs of major maintenance activities are capitalized and
depreciated over the estimated useful life. Maintenance
costs which cannot be separately defined as a component
of property, plant and equipment are expensed in the
period in which they occur.

Business
performance
Leadership

Property, plant and equipment
(Note 10)

We assess the carrying value of intangible assets and
property, plant and equipment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value
of an asset may not be recoverable. In addition, for
goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite
useful life, the carrying value is at least reviewed annually in
the fourth quarter. If the carrying value of an asset
or its cash-generating unit exceeds its estimated
recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognized
in the statement of income. The assessment for impairment is performed at the lowest level of assets generating
largely independent cash inflows. For goodwill and
other intangible assets with an indefinite life, we have
determined this to be at business unit level (one level
below segment).
Except for goodwill, we reverse impairment losses in the
statement of income if and to the extent we have identified
a change in estimates used to determine the recoverable
amount.

Governance and
compliance

Adjusted earnings per share represents the basic earnings
per share from continuing operations excluding identified
items, amortization of intangible assets and income tax on
these adjustments.

Intangible assets with a finite useful life, such as licenses,
know-how, brands, customer relationships, intellectual
property rights, emission rights and capitalized development and software costs, are capitalized at historical cost
and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated
useful life of the assets, which generally ranges from five
to 40 years for brands with finite useful lives, five to 25
years for customer lists and three to 15 years for other
intangibles. Amortization methods, useful lives and residual
values are reassessed annually. Research expenditures are
recognised as an expense as incurred.

Impairments (Note 9, 10)

Leases (Note 10, 18, 21)
Lease contracts in which we have substantially all the risks
and rewards of ownership are classified as financial leases.
Upon initial recognition, the leased asset is measured at
the lower of its fair value and the present value of minimum
lease payments. Subsequent to initial recognition, the
asset is depreciated using a straight-line method, based
on the lower of the estimated useful life or the lease term.
The interest expenses are recognized as other financing
expenses over the lease term.

Financial
information

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit
for the period attributable to shareholders of the company
by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the year adjusted for the repurchased
shares. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the year for the diluting effect of the
shares of the performance-related share plan and for the
share-matching plan.

tions with non-controlling interests are recorded in equity if
there is no change in control.

Payments made under operational leases are recognized
in the statement of income on a straight-line basis over the
term of the lease.

We recognize conditional asset retirement obligations in
the periods in which sufficient information becomes available to reasonably estimate the cash outflow.

Associates and joint ventures
(Note 11)
Associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the
equity method and are initially recognized at cost. The
Consolidated financial statements include our share of the
income and expenses of the associates and joint ventures,
whereby the result is determined using our accounting
principles. When the share of losses exceeds the interest
in the investee, the carrying amount is reduced to nil and
recognition of further losses is discontinued, unless we
have incurred legal or constructive obligations on behalf
of the investee. Loans to associates and joint ventures are
carried at amortized cost less any impairment losses.

Inventories (Note 13)
Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net
realizable value. Costs of inventories comprise all costs of
purchase, costs of conversion and other costs incurred
in bringing the inventories to the present location and
condition. The costs of inventories are determined using
weighted average cost.

Provisions (Note 17)
We recognize provisions when a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event exists, it is
probable that an outflow of economic benefits is required
to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions are measured at net present value. The
increase of provisions as a result of the passage of time
is recognized in the statement of income under Financing
income and expenses.
Provisions for restructuring of activities are recognized
when a detailed and formal restructuring plan has been
approved, and the restructuring has either commenced or
has been announced publicly. We do not provide for future
operating costs.

AkzoNobel Report 2017

A provision for warranties is recognized when the underlying products or services are sold, generally based on
historical warranty data.

Financial instruments
Regular purchases and sales of financial assets and
liabilities are recognized on trade date. The initial measurement of all financial instruments is at fair value. Except for
derivatives, the initial measurement of financial instruments
is adjusted for directly attributable transaction costs.

Long-term and short-term borrowings (Note 18,
24) and Trade and other payables (Note 19)
Long-term and short-term borrowings, as well as Trade
and other payables, are measured at amortized cost,
using the effective interest rate method. The interest
expense on borrowings is included in Financing income
and expenses. The fair value of borrowings, used for
disclosure purposes, is determined on the basis of listed
market price, if available. If a listed market price is not
available, the fair value is calculated based on the present
value of principal and interest cash flows, discounted
at the interest at the reporting date, taking into account
AkzoNobel’s credit risk.

Derivative financial instruments (Note 24)
Derivative financial instruments are recognized at fair value
on the balance sheet. Fair values are derived from market
prices and quotes from dealers and brokers, or are estimated using observable market inputs. When determining
fair values, credit risk for our contract party, as well as for
AkzoNobel, is taken into account.
Changes in the fair value are recognized in the statement
of income, unless cash flow hedge accounting or net
investment hedge accounting is applied. In those cases,
the effective part of the fair value changes is deferred in
Other comprehensive income and released to the related
specific lines in the statement of income or balance sheet
at the same time as the hedged item.

Other financial non-current assets (Note 12) and
Trade and other receivables (Note 14)
Loans and receivables are measured at amortized cost,
using the effective interest method, less any impairment
losses. An allowance for impairment is established if the
collection of a receivable becomes doubtful.

Cash and cash equivalents (Note 18)
Cash and cash equivalents are measured at fair value and
include all cash balances and short-term investments that
are directly convertible into cash. Changes in fair values
are included in Financing income and expenses.

New IFRS accounting standards
IFRS standards and interpretations thereof not yet in force
which may apply to our Consolidated financial statements
for 2018 and beyond have been assessed for their potential impact. The most important upcoming changes relate
to IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments” and IFRS 15 “Revenue
from contracts with Customers” which will be adopted as
per January 1, 2018. Another important upcoming change
relates to IFRS 16 “Leases” which will be implemented as
per January 1, 2019.

IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments”
IFRS 9 introduces new requirements for classifying and
measuring financial assets and liabilities. This standard
encompasses an overall change of accounting principles
for financial instruments and replaces IAS 39 – the current
standard on financial instruments. The standard contains
new requirements for impairment of financial assets
and for hedge accounting. AkzoNobel has decided to
implement and adopt IFRS 9 as from January 1, 2018,
when it becomes effective. In 2017, we completed
the assessment of the impact of the standard, which is
set out further below.

Strategic
performance
AkzoNobel will adopt IFRS 9 as per January 1, 2018,
and will not restate its 2017 comparative figures.
The transition effect on equity as per January 1, 2018, is
€3 million after tax.

The impact on the classification and measurement of
financial assets is not significant.

An amount of €32 million of the Other financial non-current
assets and Trade and other receivables is recognized at
fair value through profit and loss and relates to derivative
financial instruments and securities. The classification
and measurement of these financial assets will remain
unchanged under IFRS 9.

IFRS 15 replaces existing revenue recognition guidance in
IFRS. It introduces a five-step model to determine when
to recognize revenue and at what amount, based on
transfer of control over goods or services to the customer.
New qualitative and quantitative disclosures will also be
required.

AkzoNobel has certain minor equity investments, which
are currently measured at their historic cost price. In
accordance with IFRS 9, these equity investments will be
measured at fair value through profit and loss. The impact
of this change is insignificant.

Transition method

Impairment model

Sale of goods

IFRS 9 introduces a new impairment model, whereby
recognition of an allowance for expected credit losses
on financial assets is required, which deviates from the
recognition of incurred credit losses under IAS 39. The
new impairment model is applicable for debt instrument
financial assets measured at amortized cost, for debt
instrument financial assets measured at fair value through
Other comprehensive income, for lease receivables,
contract assets, loan commitments and certain financial
guarantee contracts.

The vast majority of the company’s revenue is derived
from delivery of goods, being paints, coatings and chemical products. Currently, revenue is recognized when the
significant risks and rewards have been transferred to the
customer, recovery of the consideration is probable, the
associated costs and possible return of goods can be
estimated reliably and there is no continuing management
involvement with the goods. For revenue from sales of
goods these conditions are generally met at the time the

AkzoNobel will adopt IFRS 15 as per January 1, 2018
and will not restate its 2017 comparative figures. The
transition effect on equity as per January 1, 2018, is €48
million after tax.

Leadership

In accordance with IFRS 15, revenue should be recognized when the customer obtains control of the goods.
Based on our assessment, we do not expect the
application of IFRS 15 to result in a significant impact on
our consolidated financial statements. We came to the
same conclusion for the accounting treatment of variable
consideration, including among others rebates, bonuses,
discounts and payments to customers.

Governance and
compliance

IFRS 15 “Revenue from Contracts with
Customers”

product is shipped and delivered to the customer, depending on the delivery conditions.

Equipment provided to customers
AkzoNobel regularly provides mixing machines, store interior and other assets to its customers in Decorative Paints
and Performance Coatings at the start of a paint delivery
contract. Currently, such assets are not treated as a separate performance obligation and their costs are expensed
during the contract period.
Under IFRS 15, the delivery of such assets would qualify
as a separate performance obligation. However, in most
cases no revenue can be recognized at the moment
of transfer of such assets. Although the paint delivery
contracts do include target quantities to be purchased by
the customer, for nearly all of these contracts such clauses
legally do not qualify as a binding take-or-pay commitment
for a minimum quantity to be acquired by the customer.
Therefore, no revenue can be allocated to these assets
when they are transferred.

Financial
information

As the IFRS 9 impairment model accelerates the timing
of recognizing impairment losses, the implementation of
IFRS 9 will lead to recognition of an additional impairment
loss of €4 million as per January 1, 2018, mainly relating to
trade receivables. The after tax-effect is a charge of
€3 million.

Sustainability
statements

The vast majority of Other financial non-current assets as
well as the Trade and other receivables were measured
at amortized cost, using the effective interest method, less
any impairment losses. In accordance with IFRS 9,
these Other financial non-current assets and Trade and
other receivables will continue to be measured at amortized cost.

The book value at December 31, 2017, of such assets
amounted to €60 million and will be written-off in the
January 1, 2018, opening balance sheet, which has an
after-tax effect of €46 million.

Services
AkzoNobel provides certain technical services to its
customers in Performance Coatings relating to coatings
sold, after these products have been delivered. In addition,
in certain instances AkzoNobel provides shipping and
handling services after control over the products has transferred to the customer. So far, no revenue was attributed
to such services and deferred until the services were
provided to the customer.

In accordance with IFRS 15, such services are a separate
performance obligation to which revenue should be allocated. Such revenue is to be recognized over time when
the relating services are being provided. Therefore, an
amount of €3 million (€2 million after tax) will be recognized
as deferred revenue and contract liability for services still to
be provided after December 31, 2017.

Note 2: Scope of consolidation

Material subsidiaries
The Consolidated financial statements comprise the
assets, liabilities, income and expenses of approximately
360 legal entities (including the entities reported as held
for sale). We consider legal entities material when they
represent, for at least two subsequent years, more than
5 percent of either revenue or operating income (before
identified items) or based on qualitative aspects. Material
subsidiaries included in the table are 100 percent owned,
except for Akzo Nobel Swire Paints (Shanghai) Ltd., and
meet these criteria.

in a single lease accounting model, recognizing a right-of-use
asset and a lease liability. Based on the results of our assessment
so far, we expect the impact of the application of IFRS 16 to be
below 10 percent of total assets. It should be noted that the actual
impact will depend on the number, size and remaining duration
of lease contracts and any expected renewals at the moment of
implementation. We do not expect the impact on operating income
to be significant.

In April 2017, AkzoNobel officially announced its decision
to separate the Specialty Chemicals business, thereby
creating two focused, high performing businesses - Paints
and Coatings, and Specialty Chemicals. At the Extraordinary General Meeting of November 30, 2017, the shareholders approved the proposed separation of the Specialty

Other acquisitions are deemed to be individually
immaterial in respect to IFRS 3 disclosure requirements. In
2017, the other acquisitions include the acquisition of Disa
Technology (Disatech), Flexcrete Technologies Ltd and the
business of V.Powdertech Co., Ltd.

The income and expenses from Corporate and Other
included in discontinued operations mainly consist of:
• Employee benefit expenses related to employees
who were identified to be employees of the Specialty
Chemicals business starting in 2018 as part of the legal
reorganization
• Information management costs such as application
services or infrastructure costs that relate directly to the
Specialty Chemicals business
• Other contract costs that relate directly to the Specialty
chemicals business

Governance and
compliance

The results and cash flows from discontinued operations in
2016 as well as 2017 and the assets and liabilities held for
sale at December 31, 2017 almost completely relate to the
Specialty Chemicals business.

The assets and liabilities held for sale include the assets
and liabilities previously reported as part of Specialty
Chemicals combined with assets and liabilities of Corporate and Other that have directly been attributed to the
Specialty Chemicals business and are expected to be part
of the disposal, consisting mainly of:
• Post-retirement provisions were allocated between
the Specialty Chemicals business and the Paints and
Coatings business based on headcount for obligations
in relation to active employees and post-separation
retention of liabilities and obligations to finance the postretirement plans for inactive employees
• Environmental and sundry provisions if related to

EBIT (operating income excluding Identified items)

Operating income

Full-year EBIT at €905 million (2016: €928 million)
was impacted by higher raw material costs, partly
compensated by increased selling prices, continuous
improvement and cost control.
• Decorative Paints EBIT was 2% lower, due to adverse
currency effects. Steep increases in raw material costs
were offset by increased selling prices, continuous
improvement and cost control
• Performance Coatings EBIT was 12% lower, impacted
by higher raw material costs and lower volumes, partly
compensated by continuous improvement and cost
control
• EBIT in Other activities improved due to lower corporate
costs, including one-off items, as well as lower pension
and insurance related costs

Full-year operating income was negatively impacted by
identified items totalling €80 million, mainly related to the
transformation of the Paints and Coatings organization
and legal items. The identified items impacted operating
income in Other activities as well as Decorative Paints and
Performance Coatings.
In 2016, operating income was negatively impacted by
identified items totalling €5 million, including acquisition
and integration costs related to the Industrial Coatings
business, asset impairments and adjustments to postretirement provisions.

Strategic
performance
The shares of the series 2014-2016 have vested and were
delivered to the participants in 2017.
The 2015 conditional grant of shares is linked for 35
percent to the relative TSR performance of the company
compared with the peer group, 35 percent to the return
on investment (ROI) performance of the company and the
remaining 30 percent to the ranking of the company in the
RobecoSAM benchmark.
The conditional shares of the 2015-2017 series vested as
follows:
• Our TSR performance over the period 2015-2017
resulted in a fifth position within the ranking of the peer
group companies. This resulted in a vesting of
75 percent for this part of the long-term incentive
• Our ROI performance at the end of 2017 resulted in
a vesting of 73 percent for this part of the long-term
incentive
• The average position in the RobecoSAM benchmark
resulted in a vesting of 100 percent for this part of the
long-term incentive

Share-matching plan

The fair value of the performance-related shares was for
35 percent based on a market condition (TSR) and for 65
percent based on non-market based performance conditions (ROI and RobecoSAM).

The members of the Board of Management and the
members of the Executive Committee are eligible to
participate in the share-matching plan. Under certain
conditions, members who invest part of their short-term

Business
performance

Fair value of performance-related shares

Leadership

Under the performance-related share plan, a number
of conditional shares are granted to the members of
the Board of Management, members of the Executive
Committee and executives each year. The number of
participants of the performance-related share plan at yearend 2017 was 348 (2016: 355).

The share price of a common AkzoNobel share at yearend amounted to €73.02 (2016: €59.39). For further
details on our performance-related share plan, refer to the
Remuneration report.

The parameters applied for the fair value calculations are:
share price at grant date (opening of first trading date
from grant date), expected volatility (based on the share
price development of the past three years of AkzoNobel),
and risk-free interest rate (based on a Dutch zero-coupon
government bond).

Net financing expenses for the year were €78 million
(2016: €91 million). Significant variances are:
• Net interest on net debt decreased by €3 million to

financing expenses as a result of the repayment of a
higher interest bond
• Net other financing charges decreased by €10 million
to €11 million (2016: €21 million), mainly due to lower
interest on provisions

From the total amount of recognized net deferred tax

where utilization is dependent on future taxable profit in
excess of the charges arising from the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences. For these entities, net
deferred tax assets were recognized based on management’s long-term projections and tax planning strategies.

The impact of non-refundable withholding tax on the
tax rate is dependent on our relative share in the profit
of subsidiaries in countries that levy withholding tax on
dividends and on the timing of the remittance of such dividends. Based on the Dutch tax system there is a limited
credit for such taxes.

Goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite useful lives
are tested for impairment per business unit (one level
below segment level) in the fourth quarter or whenever an
impairment trigger exists. The impairment test is in principle based on cash flow projections of the five-year plan.
Elements considered to determine if a different approach
would be more appropriate are, among others, high
growth/emerging economies, geo expansion opportunities, introduction of new product ranges and opportunities
from market consolidation. In 2017, the above exception
was applied for Decorative Paints Asia and Decorative
Paints Latin America, for which the revenue growth and
EBITDA-margin development projections were extrapolated beyond the five-year explicit forecast period for another
five years, applying reduced average growth rates.

Cost of acquisition

Brands with indefinite useful lives are almost fully related
to Dulux, which is the major brand, due to its global
presence, high recognition and strategic nature. Other
intangibles include licenses, know-how, intellectual property rights, emission rights and development cost. Both at
year-end 2017 and 2016, there were no purchase commitments for individual intangible assets. No intangible assets
were registered as security for bank loans.

The key assumptions used in the projections are:
• Revenue growth: based on actual experience, analysis
of market growth and the expected market share
development
• EBITDA-margin development: based on actual
experience and management’s long-term projections

For all business units, a terminal value was calculated
based on the long-term inflation expectations of
1.2 percent. The estimated pre-tax cash flows are
discounted to their present value using a pre-tax weighted
average cost of capital. The discount rates are determined
for each business unit and range from 8.6 percent to 13.3
percent, with a weighted average of 9.7 percent.

Sensitivity tests were performed for growth assumptions
(a 50 percent reduction of the growth rate), EBITDAmargin development assumptions (a one percentage point
decrease) and for the weighted average cost of capital (a
one percentage point increase). All sensitivity tests individually confirm sufficient headroom in all businesses.

• In Decorative Paints, we invested in increased asset
integrity in both growth and mature markets, while
continuing to invest in selected growth projects, such
as the Ashington (UK) state-of-art paint factory, officially
inaugurated in September 2017, and the Langfang plant
in China
• In Performance Coatings, we invested heavily in
capacity increase in emerging markets, and more
moderately in mature markets. One example is the
opening of the Changzhou powder coatings production
facility in China, aimed at strengthening our leading
position in North Asia; while continuing to invest in our
new Powder Coatings site in Thane, India. Additionally,
several efficiency improvement projects were carried out
mostly in Europe
• In Specialty Chemicals, we invested in several asset
integrity and efficiency improvement projects while
continuing to invest in growth projects for specific
segments, such as increasing capacity of Expancel
production in Sweden and building a world-scale plant
for monochloroacetic acid (MCA) as part of a joint
arrangement with Atul in India. In 2017, we completed
the expansion of our production in Mariager, Denmark,
which supplies pharmaceutical-grade salt to the
healthcare industry, increased capacity for sodium
hydrosulfide (NASH) production in LeMoyne, US,
initiated production of organic peroxides in Los Reyes,
Mexico, and completed the plant expansion in Boxing,
China

Impairments
In 2017, several small impairments and reversal of impairments were recognized, spread over all businesses. The
impairments recognized in 2016, were mainly related to
assets of Performance Coatings.

At year-end 2017, the carrying value of investments in
associates amounted to €118 million (2016: €108 million)
and in joint ventures amounted to €nil (2016 €53 million).
The decrease in joint ventures compared with year-end

16 Note 16: Post-retirement benefit provisions

Valuations of the obligations under the plans are carried
out regularly by independent qualified actuaries. We
accrue for the expected costs of providing such postretirement benefits during the service years of the employees. Governance of the benefit plans is the responsibility
of the Executive Committee Pensions. This committee
provides oversight of the costs and risks of the plans
including oversight of the impact of the plans on the
company in terms of cash flow, pension expenses and the
balance sheet. The committee develops and maintains
policies on benefit design, funding, asset allocation and
assumption setting.

Business
performance

schemes currently are not material. Unless mandated by
law, it is our policy that any new plans are established as
defined contribution plans.

Pension plans

Plan assets principally consist of insurance (annnuity)
policies, long-term interest-earning investments and
(investment funds with holdings primarily in) quoted equity
securities. Our largest plans use derivatives (such as index
futures, currency forward contracts and swaps) to reduce
volatility of underlying variables, for efficient portfolio
management and to improve the liability matching characteristics of the assets. Limits have been set on the use
of derivatives which are periodically subject to review for
compliance with the pension fund’s investment strategy.

Almost all of the defined benefit plans have been closed
to new members since the early to mid-2000s, although
in many plans long-serving employees continue to accrue
benefits. For plans in the US, benefit accrual is frozen
and employees participate in defined contribution plans
for future service. In countries where plans are closed,
new employees are eligible to join a defined contribution
arrangement. In countries in high growth markets, pension

In line with our proactive pension risk management
strategy, we seek to reduce risk in our pension plans over
time. We continue to evaluate different potential de-risking
strategies and opportunities on an ongoing basis.
Some future de-risking transactions may have both cash
flow and balance sheet impacts which may be substantial,
as have some of the de-risking actions already taken.

Leadership

The most significant risks that we run in relation to defined
benefit plans are that investment returns fall short of
expectations, low discount rates, that inflation exceeds
expectations, and that retirees live longer than expected.
The assets and liabilities of each of the funded plans are
held outside of the company in a trust or a foundation,
which is governed by a board of fiduciaries or trustees,
depending on the legal arrangements in the country
concerned. The primary objective with regard to the
investment of pension plan assets is to ensure that each
individual plan has sufficient funds available to satisfy
future benefit obligations in accordance with local legal
and legislative requirements. For this purpose, we work
closely with plan trustees or fiduciaries to develop investment strategies. Studies are carried out periodically to
analyze and understand the trade-off between expected
investment returns, volatility of outcomes and the impact
on cash contributions. We aim to strike a cautious balance
between these factors in order to agree affordable contribution schedules with plan fiduciaries.

Governance and
compliance

Post-retirement benefit provisions relate to defined benefit
pension and other post-retirement benefit plans, including
healthcare or welfare plans. The largest defined benefit
pension plans are the ICI Pension Fund (ICIPF) and the
Akzo Nobel (CPS) Pension Scheme (CPS) in the UK which
together account for 82 percent of defined benefit obligations (DBO) and 90 percent of plan assets. Both plans are
part of continuing operations. Other pension plans include
the largely unfunded plans in Germany and the plans in
the US, which will be split into continuing and discontinued operations, and certain other smaller plans in the UK,
included in continuing operations. The benefits of these
pension plans are based primarily on years of service and
employees’ compensation. The funding policy for the
plans is consistent with local requirements in the countries
of establishment. We also provide certain healthcare and
life insurance benefits to retired employees, mainly in the
US, where plans will be split into continuing and discontinued operations, and in the Netherlands, where the plan
remains in continued operations.

Financial
information

Our dividend policy is to pay a stable to rising dividend.
We will propose a 2017 final dividend of €1.94 per share,
which would make a total 2017 dividend of €2.50 (2016:
€1.65) per share, up 52 percent, excluding the €4.00
dividend per share paid in December 2017 as advanced
proceeds related to the separation of the Specialty Chemicals business. There will be a stock dividend option with
cash dividend as default.

The cost of fully removing risk would exceed estimated
funding deficits.
Between 2014 and 2017, ICIPF and a smaller UK plan,
the ICI Specialty Chemicals Pension Fund (ISCPF), have
invested in annuity buy-in contracts that aim to hedge all
key risks related to their pensioner populations. CPS has
an insurance contract to hedge longevity risk in respect
of a portion of its pensioners. In 2017, the Trustee of the
ICIPF entered into three more annuity buy-in agreements
with Scottish Widows Limited. Together they cover, in
aggregate, £0.4 billion (€0.5 billion) of pensioner liabilities
(local plan value). The buy-ins involved the purchase of
bulk annuity policies under which the insurers will pay to
ICIPF amounts equivalent to the benefits payable to a
subset of current pensioners. The pension liabilities remain
with ICIPF and the matching annuity policies are held
within ICIPF. The accounting impact of the transaction is
a lower valuation of the plan assets giving a reduction in
Other comprehensive income of £67 million (€77 million).
By purchasing bulk annuities, the ICIPF and ISCPF Trustees have both taken significant steps in actively de-risking
liabilities and reducing the risk that AkzoNobel will be
required to contribute additional cash in the future.
Of the costs recognized in the statement of income €38
million concerned continuing operations (2016: €67 million
credit) and €22 million related to discontinued operations
(2016: €22 million)
Remeasurement effects recognized in Other comprehensive income for continuing operations amounted to a €462
million gain (2016: €683 million loss) and for discontinued
operations to a €24 million gain (2016: €56 million loss). Of
the net cash flow €340 million was for continuing operations (2016: €369 million) and €47 million for discontinued
operations (2016: €52 million).

Other post-retirement benefit plans
AkzoNobel provides certain healthcare and life insurance
benefits to retired employees, mainly in the US and the
Netherlands. The risks to which the US healthcare plans
expose AkzoNobel include the risk of future increases in
the cost of healthcare which would increase the cost of
maintaining the plans. The benefit payments to retirees
under the Dutch plan are frozen. Both plans expose
AkzoNobel to the risk of a further decline in discount rates,
which increases the plan obligations, and longevity risk as
the plans generally pay lifetime benefits.

Administrative expenses
In addition to the expenses borne by the funds themselves, some expenses are borne directly by AkzoNobel.
Administrative expenses are incurred, especially for the UK
pension funds, of €12 million (2016: €15 million), which are
included in Operating income, all concerning continuing
operations. In addition, we directly incurred asset management expenses of €6 million (2016: €9 million), which have
been included in Other comprehensive income.

Unfunded plans

Interest costs on DBO for both pensions and other postretirement benefits together with the interest income on
plan assets comprise the net financing expenses related to
post-retirement benefits of €19 million (€7 million continuing operations, €12 million discontinued operations) (2016:
€10 million; €6 million credit continuing operations, €16
million charge discontinued operations), see Note 6.

Plan assets
The equities and government bond debt assets in the
table below have quoted prices in active markets, although
most are held through funds comprised of such instruments which are not actively traded themselves. The UK
buy-in annuity policies are unquoted plan assets. The
other categories of plan assets include certain assets
that are not quoted in active markets. Such unquoted
securities totaled €1,045 million (2016: €971 million) and
include investments in real estate, totaling €340 million
(2016: €322 million) and other investments in infrastructure, catastrophe bonds, insurance policies and high-yield
credit strategies. Plan assets did not directly include any
of AkzoNobel’s own transferable financial instruments, nor
any property occupied by or assets used by the company.

Pension plans in asset position
Pension balances recorded under Other financial noncurrent assets totaled €895 million (2016: €220 million)
and fully concern continuing operations. The increase in
2017 was primarily due to €259 million of top-up pension
contributions and €417 million of net actuarial gains in the
relevant plans. These assets could be recognized under
IFRIC 14 because economic benefits are available in the
form of future refunds from the plan or reductions in future
contributions to the plan, either during the life of the plan
or on the (final) settlement of the plan liabilities.

The remaining pension plans primarily represent defined
contribution plans. This includes, among others, the
Pension Fund APF in the Netherlands and the 401k Plan
in the US. The ITP2 plan in Sweden is financed through
insurance with the Alecta insurance company and is
classified as a multi-employer defined benefit plan. As
AkzoNobel does not have access to sufficient information
from Alecta to enable a defined benefit accounting treatment, it is accounted for as a defined contribution plan.
Contributions in 2017 were €8 million (2016: €7 million).
Alecta’s target funding ratio in 2017 was 140 percent. The
most recently quoted ratio at December 2017 stood at
154 percent. There is also a small number of multi-employer plans in Germany in which AkzoNobel participates with
annual contributions totaling €1 million. These are also
accounted for as defined contribution plans. The expenses
of all plans accounted for as defined contribution plans
in AkzoNobel totaled €156 million (€88 million continuing
operations, €68 million discontinued operations) in 2017
(2016: €152 million; €81 million continuing operations,
€71 million discontinued operations).

The sensitivity effect on DBO shown allows for an alternative value for each assumption while the other actuarial
assumptions remain unchanged. While this table illustrates
the overall impact on DBO of the changes shown, the
significance of the impact and the range of reasonably
possible alternative assumptions may differ between the
different plans that comprise the total DBO. In particular,
the plans differ in benefit design, currency and average
term, meaning that different assumptions have different levels of significance for each plan. The sensitivity
analysis is intended to illustrate the inherent uncertainty
in the valuation of the DBO under market conditions at
the measurement date. Its results cannot be extrapolated
due to non-linear effects that changes in the key actuarial
assumptions may have on the total DBO. Furthermore, the
analysis does not indicate a probability of such changes

occurring and it does not necessarily represent our view
of expected future changes in DBO. Any management
actions that may be taken to mitigate the inherent risks in
the post-retirement defined benefit plans are not reflected
in this analysis, as they would normally be reflected in plan
asset changes rather than DBO changes.

The figures in the table below are the estimated future
benefit payments to be paid from the plans to beneficiaries
over the next ten years.

Pensions
2017

The sensitivities in the table only apply to the DBO and
not to the net amounts recognized in the balance sheet.
Movements in the fair value of plan assets (which include
the de-risking instruments) would, to a significant extent,
be expected to offset movements in the DBO resulting
from changes in the given assumptions. The annuity buy-in
contracts cover 99 percent of pensioner liabilities (2016:
96 percent) and 82 percent of total liabilities at ICIPF
(2016: 76 percent). The longevity hedge contract covers
58 percent of pensioner liabilities (2016: 66 percent) and
36 percent of total liabilities at CPS (2016: 38 percent).

Governance and
compliance

In 2018, we expect to contribute €269 million (2017: €367
million) to our defined benefit pension plans. We expect
to pay a further €19 million (2017: €20 million) for other
post-retirement benefit plans. No allowance is made for
any special one-off contributions that may arise in relation
to new de-risking opportunities.

Funding basis

A plan specific basis must be agreed with each trustee board in accordance with UK regulations. The basis is not
the same as the IFRS calculation as it uses more prudent assumptions about life expectancy and the discount
rates reflect prudent estimates of the expected return on assets actually held, thus the trustees’ investment strategies will impact the discounted value of liabilities

AkzoNobel Report 2017

Provisions for restructuring of activities comprise of
accruals for certain employee benefits and for costs which
are directly associated with plans to exit or cease specific
activities and closing down of facilities. For all restructuring
provisions a detailed formal plan exists and the implementation of the plan has started or the plan has been
announced before the balance sheet date. Most restructuring plans are expected to be completed within one year
from the balance sheet date.

Environmental liabilities
We are confronted with substantial costs arising out
of environmental laws and regulations, which include
obligations to eliminate or limit the effects on the
environment of the disposal or release of certain wastes
or substances at various sites. Proceedings involving
environmental matters, such as the alleged discharge of
chemicals or waste materials into the air, water, or soil, are
pending against us in various countries. In some cases,
this concerns sites divested in prior years or derelict sites
belonging to companies acquired in the past.
Environmental liabilities can change substantially due to
the emergence of additional information on the nature or
extent of the contamination, the geological circumstances,
the necessity of employing particular methods of remediation, actions by governmental agencies or private parties,
or other factors.
The provisions for environmental costs amounted to
€103 million at year-end 2017 (2016: €252 million). The
provision has been discounted using an average pre-tax
discount rate of 1.8 percent (2016: 2.0 percent). While
it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all pending environmental exposures, it is reasonably possible that there
will be a need for future provisions for environmental costs
which, in management’s opinion, based on information
currently available, would not have a material effect
on the company’s financial position but could be material
to the company’s results of operations in any one
accounting period.

Sundry provisions relate to a variety of provisions,
including provisions for claims, antitrust cases and other
long-term employee benefits, such as long-service leave
and jubilee payments. The majority of the cash outflows
related to sundry provisions are expected to be within
one to five years. In calculating the sundry provisions, a
pre-tax discount rate of on average 1.2 percent (2016:
2.1 percent) has been used.
A number of claims against AkzoNobel are pending, all of
which are contested. We are also involved in legal disputes
and disputes with tax authorities in several jurisdictions. AkzoNobel has provided various indemnities and
guarantees in respect of past divestments to the relevant
purchasers and their permitted assigns (if applicable),
which in general are capped in time and/or amount (in
proportion to the value received). The provided guarantees
and indemnities have varying maturity periods. AkzoNobel has received various claims under such indemnities
and guarantees. In some instances, AkzoNobel has been
named as a direct defendant despite the divestments.

Provisions are recognized when an outflow of economic
benefits for settlement is probable and the amount can
be reliably estimated. It should be understood that, in light
of possible future developments, such as: (a) potential
additional lawsuits; (b) possible future settlements; and (c)
rulings or judgments in pending lawsuits, certain cases
may result in additional liabilities and related costs.
At this point in time, we cannot estimate any additional
amount of loss or range of loss in excess of the recorded
amounts with sufficient certainty to allow such amount or
range of amounts to be meaningful. While the outcome
of said cases, claims and disputes cannot be predicted
with certainty, we believe, based upon legal advice and
information received, that the final outcome will not materially affect our consolidated financial position but could be
material to our results of operations or cash flows in any
one accounting period.

Governance and

The individual contracts of the members of the Board of
Management are determined by the Supervisory Board
within the framework of the remuneration policy adopted
by the Annual General Meeting of shareholders. For more
detailed information on the decisions of the Supervisory
Board with respect to the individual contracts of the
members of the Board of Management, see the Remuneration report. The service agreement with Mr. Büchner
was terminated by mutual consent, while observing the

The short-term incentives for 2017 are linked to ROI
(20 percent), EBIT (20 percent), OCF (20 percent),
Revenue growth (10 percent) and the individual and qualitative targets of the members of the Board of Management
(30 percent).

Post-contract compensation
This refers to compensation intended for building up
retirement benefits instead of pension contributions. The
compensation is based on age and is calculated over the
2017 remuneration. These contributions are paid on base
salary only. For Mr. Büchner, the contributions are paid
over the base salary in the current year and the short-term
incentive related to that year.

The primary objective of liquidity management is to provide
for sufficient cash and cash equivalents at all times and
any place in the world to enable us to meet our payment
obligations. We aim for a well-spread maturity schedule of
our long-term borrowings and a strong liquidity position.
At year-end 2017, we had €1.3 billion available as cash
and cash equivalents (2016: €1.5 billion), see Note 18. In
addition, we have a €1.8 billion multi-currency revolving
credit facility, which was extended in 2017 with one additional year to 2022. This facility does not contain financial
covenants or acceleration provisions that are based on
adverse changes in ratings or on material adverse change.
At year-end 2017 and 2016, this facility had not been
drawn. We have US dollar and euro commercial paper
programs in place, which can be used to the extent that

the equivalent portion of the €1.8 billion multi-currency
revolving credit facility is not used. We had €112 million
commercial paper outstanding at year-end 2017, at yearend 2016 we had no commercial paper outstanding. The
table above shows our cash outflows per maturity group.
The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual
undiscounted cash flows.

Credit risk arises from financial assets such as cash and
cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments with a
positive fair value, deposits with financial institutions, and
trade receivables. We have a credit risk management
policy in place to limit credit losses due to non-performance of financial counterparties and customers. We
monitor our exposure to credit risk on an ongoing basis at
various levels. We only deal with financial counterparties
that have a sufficiently high credit rating.

Business
performance

Between
1 and 5 years

Generally, we do not require collateral in respect of
financial assets. Investments in cash and cash equivalents
and transactions involving derivative financial instruments
are entered into with counterparties that have sound
credit ratings and good reputation. Derivative transactions
are concluded mostly with parties with whom we have
contractual netting agreements and ISDA agreements in
place. We set limits per counterparty for the different types
of financial instruments we use. We closely monitor the
acceptable financial counterparty credit ratings and credit
limits and revise where required in line with the market
circumstances. We do not expect non-performance by
the counterparties for these financial instruments. Due to
our geographical spread and the diversity of our customers, we were not subject to any significant concentration
of credit risks at balance sheet date. The credit risk from
trade receivables is measured and analyzed at a local
operating entity level, mainly by means of ageing analysis,
see Note 14. Generally, the maximum exposure to credit
risk is represented by the carrying value of financial assets
in the balance sheet.

Liquidity risk management

Credit risk management

Financial
information

Our activities expose us to a variety of financial risks:
market risk (including currency risk, fair value interest rate
risk and price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. These risks
are inherent to the way we operate as a multinational with
a large number of locally operating subsidiaries. Our overall
risk management program seeks to identify, assess, and
– if necessary – mitigate these financial risks in order to
minimize potential adverse effects on our financial performance. Our risk mitigating activities include the use of
derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures. The Board of Management is ultimately responsible
for risk management. We centrally identify, evaluate and
hedge financial risks, and monitor compliance with the
corporate policies approved by the Board of Management,
except for commodity risks, which are subject to identification, evaluation, hedging and monitoring in the businesses.
We have treasury hubs located in Brazil, China, Singapore
and the US that are primarily responsible for regional cash
management and short-term financing. We do not allow
for extensive treasury operations at subsidiary level directly
with external parties.

Maturity of liabilities and cash outflows

At year-end 2017, the credit risk on consolidated level was
€3.4 billion (2016: €4.4 billion) for cash, loans, trade and
other receivables. Our credit risk is well spread among
both global and local counterparties. Our largest counterparty risk amounted to €366 million at year-end 2017
(2016: €289 million).

Foreign exchange risk
management

At year-end 2017, no hedges of net investments in foreign
operations were outstanding.

Trade and financing transactions

Interest rate risk management

We operate in a large number of countries, where we have
clients and suppliers, many of whom are outside of the
local functional currency environment. This creates currency exposure which is partly netted out on group level.
The purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is
to protect us from the risk that the functional currency net
cash flows resulting from trade or financing transactions
are adversely affected by changes in exchange rates.
Our policy is to hedge our transactional foreign exchange
rate exposures above predefined thresholds from recognized assets and liabilities. Cash flow hedge accounting
on forecasted transactions is applied on a limited scale.
Derivative transactions with external parties are bound by
limits per currency.
In general, our forward exchange contracts have a maturity
of less than one year. When necessary, forward exchange
contracts are rolled over at maturity. Currency derivatives
are not used for speculative purposes.

Investments in foreign subsidiaries, associates
and joint ventures
During 2017, net investment hedge accounting was
applied on hedges of certain net investments in foreign
operations which were hedged with forward exchange
contracts. During 2017, these hedges were fully effective.

AkzoNobel Report 2017

We are partly financed with debt in order to obtain more
efficient leverage. Fixed rate debt results in fair value interest rate risk. Floating rate debt results in cash flow interest
rate risk. We treat fixed rate debt maturing within one year
as floating rate debt for debt portfolio purposes. At the end
of 2017, the fixed/floating rate of our outstanding bonds
shifted from 100 percent fixed at year-end 2016 to 55%
percent fixed at year-end 2017. During 2017, we have not
used any interest rate derivatives.

Capital risk management
Our objectives when managing capital are to safeguard
our ability to satisfy our capital providers and to maintain
a capital structure that optimizes our cost of capital. For
this we maintain a conservative financial strategy, with the
objective to remain a strong investment grade company
as rated by the rating agencies Moody’s and Standard &
Poor’s. The capital structure can be altered, among others,
by adjusting the amount of dividends paid to sharehol
ders, return capital to capital providers, or issue new debt
or shares.
In November 2017, a floating rate note was issued with
a nominal value of €500 million maturing in 2019 at a
coupon of 3-months EURIBOR plus 0.20 percent markup, floored at zero percent.
Consistent with other companies in the industry, we
monitor capital headroom on the basis of funds from
operations in relation to our net borrowings level (FFO/
NB-ratio). The FFO/ NB-ratio at year-end 2017 amounted
to 0.40 (2016: 0.55) based on AkzoNobel total operations
figures. Funds from operations are based on net cash from
operating activities after tax, which is adjusted, among
others, for the elimination of changes in working capital,

additional payments for pensions and for the effects of the
underfunding of post-retirement benefit obligations. Net
borrowings are calculated as the total of long and shortterm borrowings less cash and cash equivalents, adding
an after-tax amount for the underfunding of post-retirement benefit obligations and lease commitments.

Fair value of financial instruments
and IAS 39 categories
In the table “Fair value per financial instrument category”
insight is provided in the recognition of the respective
financial instruments per IAS 39 category. The total carrying value is based on the accounting principles as outlined
in Note 1. The loans, receivables and other liabilities are
recognized at amortized cost, using the effective interest method. The only financial instruments accounted for
at fair value through profit or loss are derivative financial
instruments, securities in Other financial non-current
assets and the short-term investments included in
cash. The fair value of foreign currency contracts, swap
contracts, oil contracts and gas and electricity futures
was determined by valuation techniques using market
observable input (such as foreign currency interest rates
based on Reuters) and by obtaining quotes from dealers
and brokers.
The following valuation methods for financial instruments
carried at fair value through profit or loss are distinguished:
• Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities
• Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within
level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either
directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from
prices)
• Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based
on observable market data (unobservable)
For the purpose of determining the fair value per financial
instrument category, shown in the column “fair value”
we estimated the fair value of the bonds issued included
in our long-term and short-term borrowings based on

Strategic

We have evaluated the potential effect of netting

We enter into derivative transactions under International
Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) master netting
agreements. In general, under such agreements the
amounts owed by each counterparty on a single day in
respect of transactions outstanding in the same currency
may be aggregated into a single net amount that is
payable by one party to the other. In certain circumstances
– e.g. when a credit event such as a default occurs – all
outstanding transactions under the agreement may be
terminated, the termination value is assessed and a net
amount is payable in settlement of the transactions.

similar maturities. The carrying amounts of cash and cash
equivalents, trade receivables less allowance for impairment, short-term borrowings and other current liabilities
approximate fair value due to the short maturity period of
those instruments and were determined using level 2 fair
value methods. For €110 million of Other financial noncurrent assets a level 3 fair valuation method (discounted
cash flow) was used resulting in a deviation between the
fair value and the carrying value.

Sensitivity object
Foreign currencies:
We perform foreign currency sensitivity analysis
by applying an adjustment to the spot rates
prevailing at year-end. This adjustment is based
on observed changes in the exchange rate in the
past and management expectation for possible
future movements. We then apply the expected
possible volatility to revalue all monetary assets
and liabilities (including derivative financial instruments) in a currency other than the functional
currency of the subsidiary in its balance sheet at
year-end.
Interest rate:
We perform interest rate sensitivity analysis
by applying an adjustment to the interest rate
curve prevailing at year-end. This adjustment is
based on observed changes in the interest rate
in the past and management expectation for
possible future movements. We then apply the

On January 1, 2018, AkzoNobel internally separated the
Specialty Chemicals business through an organizational
split of operations and functions and by the legal transfer
of all assets, liabilities and employees (including contracts)
allocated to the Specialty Chemicals business, apart from
some delayed transfers, to a standalone group of companies under Akzo Nobel Chemicals Holding B.V., a wholly
owned subsidiary of Akzo Nobel N.V.. Effective as of
January 1, 2018, Akzo Nobel N.V. and Akzo Nobel Chemicals Holding B.V. entered into a Master Separation Agreement and a set of ancillary and service level agreements,
together effectuating the internal separation and providing
a framework for the relationship between AkzoNobel and
the Specialty Chemicals group going forward.

AkzoNobel Report 2017

Of the Shareholders’ equity of €5.9 billion, an amount of
€5.1 billion (2016: €5.8 billion) was unrestricted and
available for distribution – subject to the relevant provisions
of our Articles of Association and Dutch law. The cash
flow hedge reserve is individually considered to be
restricted if they lead to an increase of Shareholders’
equity at year-end.
Statutory reserves have been recognized following Article
373 paragraph 4 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. At
the Annual General Meeting of shareholders of April 26,
2001, an amendment to the Articles of Association was
approved whereby the par value of the priority shares was
decreased to €400 and of the common shares and the
cumulative preferred shares to €2. As the revised nominal
values are lower than the original par values, in accor-

dance with Article 67a of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code,
we recognize a statutory reserve of €61 million for this
reduction in subscribed share capital. Statutory reserves
also include €24 million for capitalized development costs,
as well as the reserves relating to earnings retained by
subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures after 1983,
to the extent that there are limitations for AkzoNobel to
arrange profit distributions.

Dividend
With due observance of Dutch law and the Articles of
Association, it is proposed that net income of €200 million
is carried to the other reserves. Furthermore, with due
observance of article 43, paragraph 7, it is proposed that
dividend on priority shares of €1,152 and on common
shares of €632 million (to be increased by dividend on
shares issued in 2018 before the ex-dividend date) will be
distributed. Following the acceptance of this proposal, the
holders of common shares will receive a dividend of €2.50
per share (up 52 percent), of which €0.56 was paid earlier
as an interim dividend. The final dividend of €1.94 per
share (which under the conditions to be published
by the company and at the shareholders’ election will be
paid either in cash or in stock) will be made available from
May 25, 2018.

In December 2018, a bond of €800 million will mature.
This bond is classified as a short-term borrowing.

Leadership

We had €112 million commercial paper outstanding at
year-end 2017, at year-end 2016 we had no commercial
paper outstanding.

At year-end 2017, Akzo Nobel N.V. had outstanding
foreign exchange contracts to buy currencies for a total of
€1.0 billion (year-end 2016: €1.2 billion), while contracts
to sell currencies totaled €1.2 billion (year-end 2016:
€0.9 billion). The contracts mainly related to US dollars,
Swedish krona, pound sterling and Chinese yuan and all
have maturities within one year. These contracts offset the
foreign exchange contracts concluded by the subsidiaries,
and the fair value changes are recognized in the statement
of income to offset the fair value changes on the contracts
with the subsidiaries. For information on risk exposure
and risk management, see Note 24 of the Consolidated
financial statements.

Akzo Nobel N.V. has declared in writing that it accepts
joint and several liability for contractual debts of certain
Dutch consolidated companies (Article 403 of Book
2 of the Dutch Civil Code). These debts, at year-end
2017, aggregating €0.7 billion (2016: €0.7 billion), are
included in the Consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, at year-end 2017, guarantees were issued on behalf
of consolidated companies for an amount of €1.6 billion
(2016: €1.2 billion).

Financial
information

At year-end 2017 and 2016, none of the borrowings was
secured by collateral.

We have US dollar and euro commercial paper programs
in place, which can be used to the extent that the equivalent portion of the €1.8 billion multi-currency revolving
credit facility is not used.

Note H: Financial instruments

The debts and liabilities of the consolidated companies
underlying these guarantees are included in the
Consolidated balance sheet or in the amount of commitments in respect of operational lease contracts as
disclosed in Note 21 of the Consolidated financial
statements. Guarantees relating to associates and joint
ventures amounted to €5 million (2016: €5 million).

What we have audited
We have audited the accompanying financial statements
2017 of Akzo Nobel N.V., Amsterdam (‘the Company’).
The financial statements include the consolidated financial
statements of Akzo Nobel N.V. and its subsidiaries
(together: ‘the Group’) and the company financial
statements.
The consolidated financial statements comprise:
• the consolidated balance sheet as at December 31,
2017;
• the following statements for 2017: the consolidated
statement of income and the consolidated statements
of comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash
flows; and
• the notes, comprising a summary of significant
accounting policies and other explanatory information.
The Company financial statements comprise:
• the balance sheet as at December 31, 2017;
• the statement of income for the year then ended;
• the notes, comprising a summary of the accounting
policies and other explanatory information.

We conducted our audit in accordance with Dutch law,
including the Dutch Standards on Auditing. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the
section ‘Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial
statements’ of our report.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for
our opinion.
Independence
We are independent of Akzo Nobel N.V. in accordance
with the European Regulation on specific requirements
regarding statutory audit of public interest entities, the ‘Wet
toezicht accountantsorganisaties’(Wta, Audit firms supervision act), the ‘Verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid
van accountants bij assuranceopdrachten’ (ViO – Code
of Ethics for Professional Accountants, a regulation with
respect to independence) and other relevant independence requirements in the Netherlands. Furthermore,
we have complied with the ‘Verordening gedrags- en
beroepsregels accountants’ (VGBA – Code of Ethics for
Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to
rules of professional conduct).

Our audit approach
Overview and context
Akzo Nobel N.V. is a global paints and performance coatings company and a major producer of specialty chemicals
headquartered in the Netherlands. The group is comprised
of several components and therefore we considered our
group audit scope and approach as set out in the section
‘The scope of our group audit’. We paid specific atten-

The basis for our opinion

Leadership

In our opinion:
• Akzo Nobel N.V.’s consolidated financial statements
give a true and fair view of the financial position of the
Group as at December 31, 2017 and of its result and
cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted
by the European Union (EU-IFRS) and with Part 9 of
Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code; and
• Akzo Nobel N.V.’s company financial statements give
a true and fair view of the financial position of the
Company as at December 31, 2017 and of its result for
the year then ended in accordance with Part 9 of Book
2 of the Dutch Civil Code.

The financial year 2017 was characterised by management’s announcement in April 2017 for plans to separate
the Specialty Chemicals Business. The company received
approval of the EGM on 30 November 2017 to proceed
with the separation through either a legal demerger or
private sale. Furthermore, management concluded that
the Specialty Chemicals Business will be reported in
accordance with IFRS 5 – ‘Non-Current Assets Held for
Sale and discontinued operations’ in the 2017
consolidated financial statements. Further details of the
implications of this event are described in the section
on key audit matters.
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality
and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the
financial statements also taking into account the aforementioned separation plans for the Specialty Chemicals
Business. In particular, we considered where the Board of
Management made important judgements; for example,
in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved
making assumptions and considering future events that
are inherently uncertain. In note 1 of the consolidated
financial statements the company describes the areas
of judgment in applying accounting policies and the key
sources of estimation uncertainty. Given the significant
estimation uncertainty and the related higher inherent risk
of material misstatement in the valuation of goodwill and
other intangibles with indefinite useful lives, valuation of the
post-retirement benefit provisions and accounting for and
valuation of income tax positions (including the impact of
the US tax reform), we considered these to be key audit
matters as set out in the key audit matter section of this
report. In addition, we identified the application of IFRS 5
for the Specialty Chemicals Business as a new key audit
matter this year as this accounting treatment is complex,
non-recurring and it materially impacts the financial statements. Last year we also included a key audit matter
related to the transition to a new auditor which is no longer
applicable this year.

Other areas of focus, that were not considered to be key
audit matters were the disclosures relating to the transition
in 2018 from accounting standard IAS 18 – ‘Revenue’ to
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’, and
from IAS 39 - ‘Financial Instruments’ to IFRS 9 ‘Financial
Instruments, environmental-, sundry- and legal provisions,
the overall impact of the planned separation on our audit
including understanding of management’s separation
process, as well as information technology general controls
(‘ITGCs’). The ITGC’s are the policies and procedures
used by the Company to ensure information technology
(‘IT’) operates as intended and provides reliable data for
financial reporting purposes. As in all of our audits, we also
addressed the risk of fraud due to management override
of internal control, including evaluating whether there was
evidence of bias by the Board of Management that may
represent a risk of material misstatement.

The outlines of our audit approach were as follows:

We ensured that the audit teams both at group and at
component levels included the appropriate skills and
competences which are needed for the audit of a paints
and performance coatings company and a producer
of specialty chemicals. We also included specialists or
experts in the areas of tax, pensions, IT, treasury and valuations on our team.

Key audit matters
• Specialty Chemicals Business recorded as Held for sale and
disconinued operations (IFRS5)
• Impairment testing of goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite
useful lives
• Valuation of post-retirement benefit provisions
• Valuation of deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions

Materiality
• Overall materiality: €70 million

Audit scope
• We conducted audit work
at 44 components in 14
countries
• Site visits by the group team
were conducted in 8 countries
– US, China, Sweden, UK,
Brazil, Germany, Singapore and
the Netherlands
• Audit coverage: 71% of
consolidated revenue,
72% of consolidated
total assets and 75% of
consolidated profit
before tax

Materiality
The scope of our audit is influenced by the application of
materiality which is further explained in the section ‘Our
responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements’.
Based on our professional judgment, we determined
certain quantitative thresholds for materiality, including the
overall materiality for the financial statements as a whole
as set out in the table below. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the nature,
timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual
financial statement line items and disclosures and to evaluate the effect of identified misstatements, both individually
and in aggregate, on the financial statements as a whole
and on our opinion.

Materiality
Overall group materiality

€70 million (2016: €65 million)

Basis for determining
materiality

We used our professional judgment to
determine overall materiality. As a basis for
our judgment we used 5% of total profit
before tax for continued and discontinued
operations, and excluded separation
related identified items.

Rationale for benchmark
applied

We used profit before tax from continued
and discontinued operations as the
primary benchmark based on our analysis
of the common information needs of users
of the financial statements. On this basis
we believe that profit before tax is an
important metric for the financial performance of the company. We excluded
separation related identified items as these
are non-recurring and are not representative of normal operating results.

Component materiality

To each component in our audit scope,
we, based on our judgement, allocate
materiality that is less than our overall
group materiality. The range of materiality allocated across components was
between €8 million and €60 million.

We also take misstatements and/or possible misstatements into account that, in our judgement, are material for
qualitative reasons. We agreed with the Supervisory Board
that we would report to them misstatements identified
during our audit above €3.5 million (2016: €3 million) as
well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view,
warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.

The scope of our group audit
Akzo Nobel N.V. is the parent company of a global group
of entities managed by the Board of Management and
Executive Committee. The financial information of this
group is included in the consolidated financial statements
of Akzo Nobel N.V.

None of the remaining components represented more

For the remaining components not in our group scope
we performed, among others, analytical procedures to
corroborate our assessment that there were no risks of
material misstatements within those components.
The group consolidation, financial statement disclosures
and a number of complex items are controlled and monitored centrally by Akzo Nobel N.V. and are audited by the
group engagement team at the head office. These include
impairment testing of goodwill and other intangibles with

Where the work was performed by component auditors,
we determined the level of involvement we needed to
have in their audit work to be able to conclude whether
sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained
as a basis for our opinion on the consolidated financial
statements as a whole. The group engagement team visits
the component teams on a rotational basis. The most
significant components are visited every year and other
components are visited depending on specific considerations which include amongst others audit observations,
specific risks identified or other major events. In the current
year the group engagement team visited the component
teams and local management in the US, China, Sweden,
UK, Brazil, Germany, Singapore and the Netherlands and
conference/video calls were held with all the component
auditors on various moments during the year. During
these visits and calls, the audit approach, findings and
observations reported to the group audit team were
discussed in more detail. Furthermore, we reviewed

Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit
of the financial statements. We have communicated the
key audit matters to the Supervisory Board. The key audit
matters are not a comprehensive reflection of all matters
that were identified by our audit and that we discussed.
In this section, we described the key audit matters and
included a summary of the audit procedures we performed
on those matters.

Leadership

For all other components we used component auditors
who are familiar with the local laws and regulations to
perform the audit work. For all components in scope we
performed hard close audit procedures on the interim
October balance sheet positions and results. These hard
close audit procedures include substantive audit work on
material balances and transactions at group level as well
as components in scope for our group audit.

By performing the procedures above at components,
combined with additional procedures at group level,
we have been able to obtain sufficient and appropriate
audit evidence on the Group’s financial information,
as a whole, to provide a basis for our opinion on the
financial statements.

opinions on these matters or on specific elements of the
financial statements. Any comments or observations
we make on the results of our procedures should be read

significant component, were subjected to audits of their
complete financial information as those components
are material to the group. Twelve components were
subjected to specific risk-focussed audit procedures as
they include significant or higher risk areas. Additionally,
two components were selected for audit procedures to

these procedures, we achieved the following coverage on
the financial line items (which include both continued and
discontinued operations, as well as assets held for sale):

Key audit matters
Key audit matter

How our audit addressed the matter

Specialty Chemicals Business recorded as Held for sale and Discontinued Operations (IFRS5)
Note 2
In April 2017 Akzo Nobel N.V. announced their plans to separate the Specialty Chemicals Business and
received the approval of the EGM on November 30, 2017 to proceed with the separation through either
demerger or private sale. Management concluded that the Specialty Chemicals Business will be reported in
accordance with IFRS 5 – ‘Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and discontinued operations’ in the 2017 consolidated financial statements.

Our audit procedures included, among others, an evaluation of the client’s conclusions on the classification of the
disposal group as held for sale and the results of the Specialty Chemicals Business as discontinued operations.
This included evaluating whether the Specialty Chemicals Business classifies as one disposal group, assessing the
valuation of the assets of the disposal group as the lower of the carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell, the
presentation of the assets in the financial statements and the date as of which the Specialty Chemicals Business is
classified as held for sale. In addition we evaluated the presentation of the results of the Specialty Chemicals Business
as discontinued operations, the allocated income and expenses including assumptions and estimates made with
regard to the allocation, as well as the adjustments recorded relating to central cost allocations and reversal of depreciation and amortization. We have made use of technical accounting specialists as part of our audit.

The application of IFRS 5 ‘Non-Current Asset Held for Sale and Discontinued operations’ is significant to our
audit because the assessment of the classification is complex, the transaction and its accounting is non-routine
and involves significant management judgements. These include, amongst others, the date of classification of the non-current assets as held for sale, the identification of the disposal group and the presentation
of its results as discontinued operations. As a result of these conclusions, there are requirements around the
valuation of the assets of the disposal group and presentation in the consolidated financial statements and
disclosure notes, the identification of income and expenses allocated to the Specialty Chemicals Business,
assumptions and estimates made with regard to the allocations, and adjustments to be recorded (e.g. central
cost allocations, seizing of depreciation and amortization).

158

Impairment testing of goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite useful lives
Note 9
As at December 31, 2017 the Company’s Goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite useful lives are valued
at €3.3 billion (of which €0.5 billion is classified as held for sale). The key assumptions and sensitivities are
disclosed in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. The annual impairment test for Goodwill and
indefinite life intangible assets is significant to our audit because the assessment process is complex, involves
significant management judgement and is based on assumptions that are affected by expected future market
and economic conditions, revenue growth, margin developments, the discount rates and terminal growth rates.
This is consistent with prior year. Based on the annual goodwill impairment test, including sensitivity tests, the
Board of Management concluded that no impairment of goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite useful
lives was necessary.

Our procedures included, among others, evaluation of the assumptions and methodologies used in the annual impairment test prepared by the company, an assessment of the mathematical accuracy of the calculations and a reconciliation to the 2018 five year outlook as approved by the Board of Management. We have challenged management,
primarily on their assumptions applied to which the outcome of the impairment test is the most sensitive, in particular,
the projected revenue growth, margin developments, discount rates and terminal growth rates. We performed independent testing and analysis of the basic peer group composition, amongst others, and challenged management by
comparing the assumptions to historic performance of the company and local economic developments, taking into
account the sensitivity tests of the goodwill balances for any changes in the respective assumptions. We assessed
the adequacy of the company’s disclosures in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements and in particular the key
assumptions to which the outcome of the impairment test is most sensitive.

Valuation of post-retirement benefit provisions
Note 16
The Post-retirement benefit provisions consist of defined benefit obligations (€15.3 billion, of which €0.9 billion
is classified as held for sale) offset by plan assets (€14.9 billion, of which €0.3 billion is classified as held for
sale). The largest pension plans are the ICI Pension Fund (ICIPF) and the AkzoNobel Pension Scheme (CPS)
in the UK which together account for 82 percent of defined benefit obligations (DBO) and 90 percent of plan
assets. Management procedures over the Post-retirement benefit provisions, specifically the procedures on
the DBO, the de-risking transactions during the year, and updates to the assumptions were significant to our
audit because the assessment process is complex, involves significant management judgement and is based
on actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, compensation increase, expected inflation rates, mortality
tables and indexation percentages, as disclosed in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. This is
consistent with prior year. Technical expertise is required to determine the amounts and significant de-risking
transactions that have occurred.

We evaluated the Board of Management’s actuarial assumptions, specifically the changes in assumptions applied in
the UK, the valuation methodologies used and we assessed the objectivity and competence of the company’s external
pension experts used for the calculation of the Post-retirement benefit positions. We have challenged management,
primarily on their assumptions applied to which the Post-retirement benefit provisions are the most sensitive, by
performing independent testing and comparing to the published actuarial tables, amongst other. We also tested the
participant census data and the valuation of the plan assets through independent price testing. Further, we tested the
de-risking transactions to the UK pension plans and we verified the appropriate accounting. We also assessed the
adequacy of the company’s disclosure in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements.

Valuation of deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions
Note 7
The Group operates in various countries and is subject to income taxes in various tax jurisdictions. The assessment of the valuation of deferred tax assets, resulting from net operating losses and temporary differences, and
provisions for uncertain tax positions is significant to our audit as the calculations are complex and depend on
sensitive and judgmental assumptions. These include, amongst others, long-term future profitability and local
fiscal regulations and new developments (e.g. the US Tax reform and impact of the separation of the company).
The company’s disclosures concerning income taxes are included in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.

Our procedures included, among others, procedures on the completeness and accuracy of the deferred tax assets and
uncertain tax positions recognized. We challenged and tested the Board of Management’s assessment of the recoverability of the deferred tax assets, including the projected revenue growth and margin development based on the 2018
five year outlook as approved by the Board of Management, the probability of future cash outflows of the uncertain
tax positions identified by the company and the impact of the planned separation on the business projections. We also
assessed the applicable local fiscal regulations and developments, in particular those related to changes in the statutory income tax rate (e.g. the US Tax reform) and of the statutes of limitation since these are key assumptions underlying the valuation of the deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions. We analysed the tax positions and evaluated
the assumptions and methodologies used. In addition, we also focused on the adequacy of the company’s disclosures
on deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions and assumptions used.

performance

The Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the
company’s financial reporting process.
Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial
statements
Our responsibility is to plan and perform an audit engagement in a manner that allows us to obtain sufficient and
appropriate audit evidence to provide a basis for our
opinion. Our audit opinion aims to provide reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are
free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance
is a high but not absolute level of assurance which makes
it possible that we may not detect all misstatements.
Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are
considered to be material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the
financial statements.

Leadership

Our appointment
We were appointed as auditors of Akzo Nobel N.V. on
April 19, 2014 by the Supervisory Board following the
passing of a resolution by the shareholders at the annual
meeting held on April 29, 2014 and the appointment has
been renewed annually by shareholders representing a
total period of uninterrupted engagement appointment of
2 years.

Governance and
compliance

In addition to the financial statements and our auditor’s
report thereon, the annual report contains other information that consists of:
• the report of the Board of Management, as defined in
note 1 to the financial statements;
• the other information pursuant to Part 9 of Book 2 of the
Dutch Civil Code;
• other parts of the annual report: How AkzoNobel
performed in 2017, Business Performance, Leadership,
Governance and compliance, Sustainability statements,
Index, Financial calendar and Glossary.

ments using the going-concern basis of accounting unless
the Board of Management either intends to liquidate
the company or to cease operations, or has no realistic
alternative but to do so. The Board of Management should
disclose events and circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the company’s ability to continue as a going
concern in the financial statements.

Materiality affects the nature, timing and extent of our audit
procedures and the evaluation of the effect of identified
misstatements on our opinion.

Appendix to our auditor’s report on the financial
statements 2017 of Akzo Nobel N.V.
In addition to what is included in our auditor’s report we
have further set out in this appendix our responsibilities for
the audit of the financial statements and explained what an
audit involves.
The auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the
financial statements
We have exercised professional judgement and have
maintained professional scepticism throughout the audit
in accordance with Dutch Standards on Auditing, ethical
requirements and independence requirements. Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements as a whole are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Our audit
consisted, among other things of the following:
• Identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud
or error, designing and performing audit procedures
responsive to those risks, and obtaining audit evidence
that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis
for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for
one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion,
forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the
intentional override of internal control.
• Obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant
to the audit in order to design audit procedures that
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of
the company’s internal control.
• Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies
used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates
and related disclosures made by the Board of Management.
• Concluding on the appropriateness of the Board of
Management’s use of the going concern basis of
accounting, and based on the audit evidence obtained,
concluding whether a material uncertainty exists related
to events and/or conditions that may cast significant

160

Financial information

|

AkzoNobel Report 2017

doubt on the company’s ability to continue as a going
concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty
exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial
statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to
modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the
audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s
report and are made in the context of our opinion on
the financial statements as a whole. However, future
events or conditions may cause the company to cease
to continue as a going concern.
• Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and
content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and evaluating whether the financial statements
represent the underlying transactions and events in a
manner that achieves fair presentation.
Considering our ultimate responsibility for the opinion on
the company’s consolidated financial statements we are
responsible for the direction, supervision and performance
of the group audit. In this context, we have determined the
nature and extent of the audit procedures for components
of the group to ensure that we performed enough work to
be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as
a whole. Determining factors are the geographic structure of the group, the significance and/or risk profile of
group entities or activities, the accounting processes and
controls, and the industry in which the group operates. On
this basis, we selected group entities for which an audit
or review of financial information or specific balances was
considered necessary.
We communicate with the Supervisory Board regarding,
among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the
audit and significant audit findings, including any significant
deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our
audit. In this respect we also issue an additional report to
the Supervisory Board in accordance with Article 11 of the
EU Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory
audit of public-interest entities. The information included in
this additional report is consistent with our audit opinion in
this auditor’s report.

We provide the Supervisory Board with a statement that
we have complied with relevant ethical requirements
regarding independence, and to communicate with them
all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be
thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with the Supervisory
Board, we determine those matters that were of most
significance in the audit of the financial statements of the
current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We
describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or
regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or
when, in extremely rare circumstances, not communicating
the matter is in the public interest.

(b) To the holders of common shares: a dividend of such
an amount per share as the remaining profit, less the

Introduction
For AkzoNobel, sustainability
means delivering long-term
value for all our stakeholders.
It underpins our purpose and
brand, our core principles and our
employee value proposition.
It’s our driver for growth, innovation
and productivity.

Sustainable business imperatives
We aim to create continuing value for AkzoNobel stakeholders in social, environmental and economic terms,
creating a bridge between the Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations and our own business
imperatives – value selling and resource productivity.
• Value selling – we are innovating to give our customers
choice and competitive advantage through product
portfolios designed to bring tangible benefits and deliver
positive social and environmental impact (see page 170)
• Resource productivity – we are creating a culture
of care for all materials used, eliminating waste and
reducing variable cost. Increased resource productivity
in our operations and supply chain makes us more
competitive and sustainable (see page 172)

Accountability
The Executive Committee has responsibility for
incorporating the sustainability agenda in the company
strategy and monitoring the performance of each business
through the Operational Control Cycle. Accountability
for delivery lies with the leaders of the businesses and
functions and their management teams. Significant
sustainability aspects material to the company are
reviewed annually, with input from internal and external
stakeholders (see Managing sustainability).
We use key indicators to track our progress in delivering
on the sustainable business imperatives. The Resource
Efficiency Index (Note 4) demonstrates how AkzoNobel
is delivering more from less, driving margin growth
which has been decoupled from resource constraints,
thereby reducing short-term costs and long-term risks.
We have established continuous value improvement
processes in every function, supported by external
benchmarks. In 2017, AkzoNobel returned to the number
one ranking in the Chemicals industry on the Dow Jones
Sustainability Index (DJSI).
We equip all employees to ensure they can contribute
to making our businesses more sustainable and include
this responsibility in personal targets and remuneration.
Since 2009, the long-term incentive for our executives has
been linked to AkzoNobel’s DJSI ranking. We will include
sustainability in the personal objectives and incentives of
all employees from 2018 onwards.

Value creation
AkzoNobel is working in all regions on early detection of
long-term societal needs which shape our innovation,
including resource scarcity. These insights bring new
business opportunities, support swift business adaptation
and enable first mover advantage.

We drive our sustainable business imperatives through
our products, programs, processes and partnerships.
The following are some practical examples, including
how they contribute to the global development agenda,
represented by the UN SDGs (those most relevant to
AkzoNobel are shown above).

Products: Coatings which improve the energy
efficiency of old buildings*
Our new Dulux Trade Plus range was devised after
listening to the needs and future ambitions of our
customers and consumers. Comprised of a ThermaCoat+
system for interior walls and a SmartShield+ solution for
exteriors, the products were specially developed to help
improve energy efficiency in older buildings – cutting
heat loss through walls, delivering energy savings and
improving comfort levels.
Homeowners and businesses in developed markets lose
millions of euros every year due to heat loss through
uninsulated solid walls, which waste up to 45% of heating
energy. Because much of our old housing stock will
continue to exist for decades, AkzoNobel has developed
solutions that can improve the energy performance in
older buildings.

Products: Water-based ultraviolet (UV)
coatings which help increase capacity and reduce
process damage*
Our UV-cured water-based coatings for wood coatings
have been designed to help reduce our customers’ overall
process costs. The fast-curing formulations contain
virtually no VOCs and allow the most compact of line
set-ups. The rapid curing means items are ready to be
stacked or assembled in as little as six minutes after
the coating has been applied. This gives manufacturers
unrivalled handle ability and reduces damage from
in-process scuffs and knocks.

3 12 13

Processes: Emission modeling which improves
well-being*
We have developed a VOC modeling tool which enables
our factories to manage and reduce their VOC emissions
in the most cost-effective way. This will allow us to stay
ahead of increasingly stringent regulation which places
limits on VOC emissions. Reducing VOC emissions also
has clear environmental and health benefits. The tool has
been piloted at five sites, with plans in place to roll it out
across the company in 2018.
*Contributes to SDGs:

Partnerships: Circular chemistry which
creates jobs*
AkzoNobel initiated the Waste-to-Chemistry consortium,
a flagship project which acts as a catalyst in the transition
towards a bio-based and circular economy. Spanning the
value chain, this unique partnership comprises Air Liquide,
AkzoNobel, Enerkem, the Port of Rotterdam and the City
of Rotterdam, the Province of Zuid Holland and Innovation
Quarter. Together, we plan to divert waste streams from
landfill and incineration, and convert them into valuable
chemical building blocks. Deployment of an innovative
gasification technology will enable the efficient and cost-

AkzoNobel plans to convert the waste-derived methanol
into dimethylether and chloromethanes – key products
supplied by our Industrial Chemicals business – which
will allow us to offer more sustainable products to our
customers. The newly available resources and generated
knowledge will also enable new plants and spin-offs,
strengthening the regional economic structure. In addition,
the plant will create shared social value by having a
direct impact on employment – there will be 50 direct
and 200 indirect new jobs created – and tax revenues
in the region.

Governance and
compliance

In collaboration with EY, we have been able to quantify, in
monetary terms, the contribution that our products and
programs make to society (see Managing sustainability).
For Forest Breath, this could be the reduction of negative
health impacts due to less formaldehyde inhalation. We
discovered that the health benefits amounted to €5 million
in 2017 (based on sales of the product in China.) This
project has shown that it is possible to put a monetary
value on the positive social impact that our products can
bring. The implications of this assessment go far beyond
the current assessments of product performance. We are
replicating the approach for other products and plan to
integrate social impact into various parts of our business,
such as our innovation activities.

Water-based UV coating customers gain environmental
and social benefits by minimizing VOC emissions and
keeping ahead of regulatory requirements, without the cost
and complexity of operating VOC abatement systems.
As well as reducing environmental impact, this solution
ultimately allows our customers to increase capacity,
which is frequently dictated by regulatory permits
surrounding VOCs. Water-based UV coatings are currently
available in the kitchen cabinet, building products
and furniture market segments. It’s another example
of a ground-breaking innovation which is transforming
our industry and increasing the current and future
competitiveness of our customers.

Color has an impressive transformational power and, as
demonstrated by our “Let’s Colour” program in Brazil
(see Note 11), it can leave a lasting legacy. This is
evidenced in particular by the work of our Coral brand in
helping and inspiring residents of the Santa Marta favela
in Rio de Janeiro.
In 2017, we used the Santa Marta program as a pilot,
taking initial steps to measure the social value creation of
our programs, in cooperation with EY. The objective of the
project was to strengthen decision-making regarding future
community investments, as we believe that insight into
social needs will help us to better design our programs.
We acquired first order of magnitude estimates based on
well-being valuation, calibrated to the local situation.
We now aim to standardize the valuation methodology
(see Managing sustainability).

information

Dulux Forest Breath is a unique paint range sold in China
which can capture and neutralize pollutants, as well as
color and protect interior walls. It’s also lower in volatile
organic compounds (VOCs). Forest Breath helps improve
indoor air quality by capturing formaldehyde and benzene
from the atmosphere. By using silver ion, it can kill germs
and bacteria to create a healthier home environment, and
it is mold resistant.

Value selling
We work closely with customers to deliver solutions
that will make their business more sustainable, while
delivering economic value to all parties in the chain. We are
assessing our entire product range in sustainability terms
to help customers make choices that deliver competitive
advantage and also benefit society.

Sustainable product portfolios
We constantly assess and reshape our product portfolio
to drive innovation and offer competitive advantage to
customers. Transparent monitoring of margin by product
category guides business decision-making.
We assess the full range of products and are collaborating
with industry peers to develop a standardized
categorization methodology.
Our portfolio approach promotes the use of safer and
more sustainable products. We take action to manage
harmful substances in advance of legislation, futureproofing our products against changes in regulations.
We have set ourselves stretching targets for the amount
of revenue and margin growth that should come from
solutions with a sustainability benefit for our customers,
versus the mainstream product solutions in the market.

Note 1: Sustainable products

More than 21% of our products met the eco-performer
criteria in 2017, having clear sustainability features and
being at least as good as mainstream alternatives. Another
20% of the total portfolio met the more demanding criteria
of the eco-premium category and we aim to maintain a
sustainable 20% of eco-premium revenue through 2020.
Eco-premium solutions differentiate AkzoNobel, matching
the standard offerings in all respects and exceeding
them in at least one of the following parameters: energy
efficiency; use of natural resources and raw materials; land
use; emissions and waste; safety risks; toxicity; health and
well-being. Products are assessed across their lifecycle
and benchmarked against current competitor solutions,
making it a moving target.
The eco-premium portfolio is dynamic as 3% of revenue
has ceased to be classified as eco-premium due to
competitive offerings having caught up. At the same time,
new solutions have been introduced to the portfolio, also
accounting for 3% of revenue.

As a result of our ongoing ambition to move towards zero
VOCs, our Decorative Paints and Performance Coatings
portfolios are undergoing a transformation towards a range
of products that are lower in their VOC content.
Decorative Paints is focusing on a multi-year program to
lead the market to water-based trim and wood product
ranges. Our overall paints and coatings portfolio showed
a decrease of 13% in average VOC content in 20161,
compared with the baseline position of 2009. Due to the
divestment of businesses with very low VOC products,
the like-for-like reduction for AkzoNobel over this period
was 25%.

Responsiveness
Satisfactory handling of customer complaints is an integral
part of our quality system. Measures include response
times and use of social media. In Decorative Paints, we
launched a new cloud-based solution which is integrated
with our customer relationship management (CRM)
system, increasing response speed and quality.

The Resource Efficiency Index demonstrates how
AkzoNobel is driving margin growth which has been decoupled from resource constraints, thereby reducing shortterm costs and long-term risks. The index is defined as
gross margin divided by cradle-to-grave carbon footprint
– reported as an index using 2012 as the baseline year.
We selected gross margin as an indicator of added
value as it is comparatively stable and captures
the financial effects of innovations and commercial
improvements. Carbon footprint is an important indicator
of resource productivity across our value chains. The
Resource Efficiency Index is therefore an integrated
indicator of our business imperatives – value selling and
resource productivity.
In 2017, our volume grew in all areas. We also acquired
an industrial coatings business from BASF. As a result,
our carbon footprint increased slightly, even though our
emissions per ton of product went down. Combined with a
lower gross margin, the Resource Efficieny Index equaled
106 compared with the 2012 baseline of 100.

creation, we developed a systematic approach in
collaboration with EY (see Value creation and Managing
sustainability). In addition, we actively participate in
social impact valuation platforms, such as the Impact
Valuation Roundtable and the World Business Council
for Sustainable Development’s Social and Natural
Capital Protocol.

Resource
productivity
AkzoNobel is driving resource productivity to make the
most of valuable raw materials, reducing environmental
impact, while strengthening our business.
Initiatives to improve material efficiency, right-first-time
and first quality production throughout our operations are
integrated in the AkzoNobel Leading Performance
System (ALPS). By focusing on resource productivity,
ALPS drives an explicit value agenda, as well as longterm operational excellence, engaging all our operations
employees in common goals. This systematic approach
drives increased raw material efficiency and reduces
waste, while better planning processes help to reduce
slow-moving and obsolete stocks. We use a range of best
practice manufacturing indicators to monitor progress, as
well as the operational eco-efficiency parameters
(see Note 7).

Note 5: Supplier engagement

In order to make the most productive use of resources,
especially raw materials, we work closely with suppliers,
identifying and minimizing supply chain risks, creating
value through continuous improvement and seeking out
collaboration and joint development opportunities to
ensure a secure and sustainable supply of products.

Supplier segmentation

Supplier sustainability framework
Our supplier sustainability framework supports continuous
improvement and delivery of our shared goals. The
foundation is AkzoNobel’s Code of Conduct for business
partners, while the framework includes processes for
supplier support visits, Together for Sustainability (TfS)
assessment and key supplier management.

Business Partner Code of Conduct

We have segmented suppliers based on an assessment
of their performance, our business relationship and
potential risks and opportunities. One segment includes
suppliers in emerging markets who require special
attention for labor conditions, environmental performance,
business integrity and security of supply of raw materials.
The other segment includes suppliers with a high level
of spend, dependency, or potential for partnership, joint
innovation and collaboration on long-term sustainability
initiatives. In 2017, supplier segmentation was integrated
into the Supplier Management process under the ALPS
Source program.

Suppliers sign the code to confirm their compliance with
environmental, social and governance requirements.
Signatories cover 97% of the product related (PR) spend
and 86% of the non-product related (NPR) spend.

Supplier support visits
This well-established program – designed to develop
suppliers in emerging markets with particular risks – is
now an integral part of our supplier selection, strategy and
collaboration processes.

Together for Sustainability (TfS)
TfS assessments and audits facilitate proactive supplier
risk management in the chemical industry. AkzoNobel
verifies its own activities against industry best practice,
and achieved the EcoVadis Gold recognition level for the
third time in 2017.

The diagram on the previous page shows suppliers
assessed by EcoVadis with risk levels set by AkzoNobel
based on the supplier’s EcoVadis score. The proportion
of “low risk” suppliers is increasing as a result of our
improvement activities during the year.

Key supplier management
Our key supplier management process focuses on
suppliers with whom we have: contractual relationships;
opportunities for meaningful value creation; partnerships
or joint innovation projects; or who have a material
impact on our upstream carbon footprint. In 2017, the
number of suppliers in this group increased from 35 to
150, representing 80% of our upstream carbon footprint.
Key suppliers work with us on a balanced scorecard
assessment of their sustainability maturity level based
on fulfilling the minimum TfS score criteria and aligning
on annual improvement objectives, including carbon
footprint reduction. The scorecard now also includes KPIs
on energy, waste, water and circular raw materials. From
2018, KPIs will include human rights.

Climate change
Climate change is one of the biggest challenges that
will shape the way we do business, both now and in
the decades to come. We support the Paris Agreement

temperature increase well below 2°C above pre-industrial
levels and pursuing efforts to limit temperature rise to
below 1.5°C.

To support the transition to a low carbon economy and
help reduce our industry’s dependence on fossil fuels, we
have committed to carbon neutrality by 2050. We also
joined the RE100 initiative, emphasizing our commitment
to source 100% renewable energy by 2050.

AkzoNobel is taking steps towards a positive carbon
balance. We see carbon footprint reduction as an
important measure of climate impact and protection, and
also as a proxy indicator of resource productivity – how
efficiently we and our supply chain partners are using raw
materials and energy in our products and operations.

Carbon pricing
We introduced carbon pricing into relevant investment
decisions, and merger and acquisition initiatives, to
drive further awareness of the environmental and future
economic impact of major decision-making. It also enables
us to make more informed decisions and strengthen our
sustainable business portfolio. Alongside the base case
for any investment, we routinely include the impact of a
cradle-to-grave carbon footprint cost at a price of €50 per
ton. With many countries discussing different schemes
to put a price on carbon as part of their legally binding
COP21 carbon reduction targets, carbon pricing enables
sustainability leaders to de-risk their businesses. In 2017,
we included carbon pricing in seven major appropriation
requests submitted to the Executive Committee.

Avoided emissions
To support our growth agenda, we focus on creating
positive value for our customers. We develop and sell
solutions that help customers avoid energy use and
carbon emissions, such as Dulux Trade Plus products,
as described in the Introduction to this section. Using the
avoided emissions guidelines we developed together with
the International Council of Chemical Associations and the
World Business Council for Sustainable Development, we
have started to evaluate the amount of carbon emissions
society avoids by using the solutions we have developed,
compared with mainstream solutions. First results show
these avoided emissions add up to nine million tons of
CO2, compared with our total product cradle-to-grave
footprint of 24.6 million tons.
Our target is to reduce our product cradle-to-grave carbon
footprint by 25-30% per ton of sales between 2012 and
2020, including the impact from VOC emissions. We

AkzoNobel Report 2017

Our share of renewable energy continues to improve.
Emissions from our own operations are 9% lower than
in 2016. We continued our work with suppliers and have
increased sales of paints with a lower carbon footprint
in Asia. As volumes grew, our total product footprint
increased to around 24.6 million tons of CO2(e), which
is 11% lower than 2012. Without the BASF acquisition,
our absolute cradle-to-grave footprint would have
been approximately equal to that in 2016, while the
reduction of footprint per ton from the 2012 baseline
would have been approximately 10%.

intend to achieve this through innovation, technology and
energy management, by switching to renewable energy
and bio-based materials. Because we measure carbon
footprint on a cradle-to-grave basis, collaboration
with suppliers and customers is crucial for our success.
In 2017, we were able to further reduce our carbon
footprint per ton sold, more than offsetting the impact of
the Industrial Coatings business acquired from BASF. Our
cradle-to-grave footprint per ton of sold product is now
7% lower than the 2012 baseline.

of bio-based materials relevant to our markets, we have
been setting up and developing partnerships across our
supply chain.

The illustration on the previous page highlights the impact
of our main initiatives on different areas of our value chain:
• Raw materials that have a lower footprint and are
bio-based or recycled
• Improved energy efficiency and fuel mix for our energyintensive operations (see Note 7)
• Improvements in formulation to reduce product
footprint, particularly during customer application
(see Note 1)

We partnered with Advanced Biochemical (Thailand) Co.,
Ltd. (ABT) and EY to develop a new online tool which
can track the use of bio-based raw materials in products
for end customers. The new system, called ProBioTracker,
will be the first tool ever to use e-certification to track
bio-based content along the value chain.

Raw materials contribute around 40% to our cradleto-grave product carbon footprint. Bio-based or recycled
materials can, in most cases, offer an option to reduce
this footprint. In order to accelerate the deployment

The diagrams above detail our energy mix and renewable
energy use. We made good progress on some key
programs and initiatives during 2017 in order to increase
the use of renewables in our energy supply and decrease
our carbon footprint. The proportion of renewable
energy in our operations is now 45%, which is already at
our 2020 ambition level.

Note 7: Operational eco-efficiency

AkzoNobel drives resource productivity by increasing raw
material efficiency, reducing energy consumption and
achieving decreases in the generation of waste streams,
emissions to water and emissions to air. Our efforts benefit
the planet, as well as our business performance, as they
simultaneously ensure our license to operate, reduce our
environmental footprint and reduce operational costs.
We use our company-wide continuous improvement
program ALPS (AkzoNobel Leading Performance System)
to drive the agenda. We continuously measure progress
on a range of operational eco-efficiency indicators and, on
a quarterly basis, we report internally on our performance
and continuous improvement, and define actions for
further improvement. Specific projects (currently 639
in total) are included in the AkzoNobel Tracker, which
monitors financial benefits and environmental impact.
Great results have been achieved on operational
eco-efficiency since the start of this ongoing program in
2009. The eco-efficiency footprint was reduced by 31%,
while improvements on the individual parameters were
also significant.

Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from our facilities are
primarily related to the fuel and power we use. This section
reflects the performance of our own operations covering
the gate-to-gate scope.
Total GHG emissions per ton of production decreased by
9% in line with the absolute GHG emissions decrease of 9%.

Local air quality
Air monitoring from AkzoNobel operations is focused on
volatile organic compounds (VOC) and NOx and SOx
emissions, with emissions being monitored and controlled
as required.

Volatile organic compounds
(VOC)
All our businesses manage VOC emissions from
operations, in line with national (e.g. in China) or
supranational (European Commission) legal requirements.
The VOC reduction focus for our Paints and Coatings
businesses concentrates on low/zero VOC product
design, going beyond controlling VOC emissions from

our operations. Reducing VOC emissions from our sites
remains part of the scope of our operational eco-efficiency
program, while our Research, Development and Innovation
groups are working on projects to reduce the solvent
content of our products (see Note 1).
VOC emissions per ton of production and total VOC
emissions decreased by 11% and 10% respectively
in 2017.

Emissions of ozone depleting substances are at a very
low level, 0.8 tons (2016: 1.8 tons). They are mainly due
to Freon22 from maintenance in older air conditioning and
cooling units, which are replaced when appropriate.

Fresh water availability

NOx and SOx
NOx and SOx emissions may have a significant impact on
local air quality because of their potential contribution to
acidification and smog formation. The emissions of these
gases are very limited for Paints and Coatings (less than
1% for both NOx and SOx).
Both NOx emissions per ton of production and total
emissions decreased 10%. Optimization of our Delesto
unit in Delfzijl, the Netherlands, resulted in a reduction of
more than 20%, reducing the impact by over 100 tons.
SOx emissions (from process emissions and energy) were
down by 22%, with a significant decrease achieved in
LeMoyne, US, due to the start-up of an SO2 recovery unit.

Volatile organic compounds in kilotons

Ozone depleting substances

Sustainable water supply is essential to life and the
sustainability of our business. AkzoNobel relies on water
for raw material production, product formulation and
manufacturing, power generation, cooling, cleaning,
transportation and the effective use of certain products.
Currently, 87% of our fresh water intake is from surface
water, while 84% is used for cooling, which is only slightly
heated before being returned to the original source.
We manage water consumption and its related risks using
a fresh water risk assessment tool, completed by each
manufacturing site. The tool assigns risk levels to water
sources, supply reliability, efficiency, quality of discharges,
compliance and social competitive factors. In total, 94%
of our sites have sustainable fresh water management in

Waste water
In total, 95% of the chemical oxygen demand (COD)
is caused by only ten production locations, with the
remainder being generated by numerous sites. These ten
locations are the primary focus for improvement actions.
The COD load to surface water per ton of production
increased to 0.07 kg/ton, whereas the total COD load
increased to 1.3 kilotons. Although some sites reduced
their emissions per ton in 2017 (such as Stockvik in
Sweden), increased volumes, change in product mix
and process changes in our polysulfides plant in Greiz
(Germany) led to a net increase.

We periodically review historic contamination at our
sites, taking remedial action when required, and have
procedures to prevent new contamination.
A dedicated group of legal and environmental experts
assesses, manages and resolves environmental liabilities.
In line with IFRS accounting rules, we make provisions
for environmental remediation costs when it is probable
that a liability will materialize and the cost can be
reasonably estimated. We have set aside an additional

€18 million, which we believe is sufficient for the sites
where we have ownership or responsibility. See Note 17

Volvo Ocean Race Boatyard for the 2017-18 edition. It
means the entire fleet of Volvo Ocean 65 racing boats is
coated with the company’s International and Awlgrip range
of products.

And while the products used on each boat need to be able
to withstand whatever Mother Nature chooses to throw at
them, it’s the glossy, colored finish that everyone can see all
the time – so this requires continual maintenance to ensure
the boats always look good.

The striking livery on the team AkzoNobel yacht combines eight custom mixed colors in
an intricate design, which took around 1,400 man hours to apply. It also features metallic
and pearl effects, which help it to stand out.

Governance and
compliance

There can’t be a global sporting event more suited
to AkzoNobel than the Volvo Ocean Race. A perfect
fit for the company’s strong maritime heritage
and long association with the sea, it’s the perfect
showcase for the company’s market-leading
products and expertise.

The company developed unique, eye-catching custom
colors for every team in the race, and the partnership
will ensure that the boats continue to look their best and
withstand the ultimate test of performance as they battle
through the toughest oceans on the planet.

Once a leg ends, technical staff from the company’s Yacht
business is on hand to offer advice and support to the shore
crew application teams. They have access to a purpose-built
paint storage unit which is available at each stopover and
includes all the International and Awlgrip coatings used on
the entire fleet. It features the materials needed to carry out
everything from a small repair through to a complete repaint
of the boats.

Note 8: Employees

AkzoNobel’s sustainability agenda is integral to our
employee value proposition. By focusing on the success
and sustainability of the business, we attract, retain
and motivate our employees. Sustainability is our core
principle, defining who we are and what we stand for.

Return on human capital investment (%)

The company’s Integrated Talent Management programs
are a vital investment in our human capital – the skills and
knowledge of employees – to ensure that we are equipped
to drive the company’s growth and profitability.

Workforce planning
Workforce planning is a mandatory process at strategic
and operational levels to develop the organization in line
with the future needs of each business, and sets the basis
for our budgeting, recruitment, development and talent
management processes.
As part of workforce planning, we identify critical roles
and focus on the succession planning of these roles
to ensure business continuity. To sustain and improve
our talent pipeline, we are focusing on the identification
and development of our internal talent through
frequent management reviews and targeted individual
development plans. In 2017, internal promotions
at executive level were at 74%, up from 61% the
previous year.

Attracting and retaining talent
We are proud to have been externally recognized as a
leading employer in many of our key countries, including
Brazil, China, France, UK, the Netherlands and Sweden.
In 2017, overall employee turnover was 12% (2016: 11%),
while the voluntary turnover was 6% (2016: 7%). This
puts us close to the chemical industry benchmark
of APQC (10% overall turnover) and the Asian benchmark
(AkzoNobel 14%, compared with the 14% benchmark).
High potential employee turnover totaled 5%. Although up
by one percentage point from 2016, this can be seen as a
positive achievement in light of the business context.

Capability building
We are focused on building the functional and leadership
capabilities needed to support sustainable, profitable
growth. During 2017, we identified the required
competencies for our key commercial roles and simplified
and updated the competency and development
frameworks for Communications, Finance, Human
Resources, Research, Development and Innovation and
Customer Service.

AkzoNobel Report 2017

Throughout 2017, around 2,000 people managers
participated in the Leadership Essentials program, which
develops the leadership behaviors that are incorporated in
our performance management system.

Diversity and inclusion
AkzoNobel is developing an increasingly engaged, diverse
and capable workforce which can deliver our vision of
leading performance in the markets in which we operate.
We believe it’s also important that our management teams
reflect the diversity of our overall workforce, because
inclusive and diverse teams are better able to understand
customer needs and innovate to meet their requirements.
Diversity and inclusion principles have been embedded
in our people management processes and leadership
training. We continue to analyze and look to close the
8% gap between the average male and female salary at
executive level. Analysis showed that only 0.3% of the
8% overall gap can be attributed to gender, while the
rest of the gap can be attributed to other factors such as
function, age, salary grade and country of work.

Engaged employees
In response to the change agenda in the company, we
launched a continuous process for surveying employee
feedback in August 2017. A random sample of employees
participated in short bi-weekly surveys. These regular
“Pulse” surveys are helping management respond more
quickly to employee needs during this period of transition.
The Pulse results for August to December 2017 show
strong adherence to our core principles, a commitment
to deliver quality and strong relationships at work. In view
of the significant organizational changes we experienced,
employees also expressed a sense of uncertainty and
concerns about job security. Our leadership development

The total reportable rate (TRR) is the number of injuries, including fatalities, resulting
in a lost time case, restricted work or requiring medical treatment by a competent
medical practitioner per 200,000 hours worked. In line with OSHA guidelines,
temporary workers are reported with employees, since day-to-day management is by
AkzoNobel. Contractors are managed by their own companies.

During 2017, AkzoNobel made progress in delivering
on each of these priorities, once again reducing the
number of injuries suffered by employees and contractors,
and ranking best-in-class for health and safety in the
Chemicals industry on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index.
In 2017, AkzoNobel received the Responsible Care®
Award from the Association of International Chemical
Manufacturers in China.

People safety
The number of reportable injuries reduced by 27%
compared with 2016, while the injury rate is now at the
target level set for 2020 (0.20). Lost time injuries and
contractor injuries also continued to reduce.
In total, 77% of our locations have been reportable
injury-free for more than a year. The overall downward
trend in reportable injuries is in line with the increased
maturity level in the implementation of our company safety
programs, including the Life-Saving Rules, the continued
implementation of the AkzoNobel HSE&S Common
Platform programs and the drive for a commitment-based
safety culture.

The lost time injury rate (LTlR) is the number of injuries resulting in a lost time case per
200,000 hours worked. Temporary workers are reported together with employees
since day-to-day management is by AkzoNobel.

Focus on contractor safety was further increased in
2017. The safety of both employees and contractors was
improved by the introduction of standardized practices
for safe working throughout the company, as well as
standardized contractor management and evaluation
procedures. The downward overall trend in TRR extended
to the TRR for contractors, which also decreased 39%.
The lost time injury rate was down 36%. There was one
contractor fatality during the year at a construction project
in India, caused by a fall from height. Prior to 2017,
there had been no employee or contractor fatalities for
five years.

(PSEs), which are minor leaks or occurrences that could
lead to more severe LoPCs.
In 2017, we raised awareness and improved reporting of
the process safety indicators. The total number of LoPC 1
and 2 reduced by 7% in 2017, compared with 2016. The
number of LoPCs classified as Level 1 (highest severity)
in 2017 was 21. The increase is partly a result of the
improved reporting. Overall Level 1 and Level 2 LoPCs
were below 2016. The number of PSE Level 3 (minor

have no regulatory notification requirement) has increased,
illustrating the desire to report, investigate and learn from
these process safety near misses, which creates more

Occupational illness frequency rate (OIFR) is the total number of reportable
occupational illness cases for the reporting period per 1,000,000 hours worked. This
parameter is reportable for employees and supervised contractors.

A central security committee with functional
representatives coordinates the main pillars of security:
personnel security, facilities, Information Management
(IM) security, travel security and intellectual property. The
readiness of our security processes is assured via internal
assessments, internal audits, and security drills. In 2017,
the definitions of security incidents were improved and
communicated throughout the organization. In 2017, 69
security incidents were reported globally, which is the
same frequency as 2016. Theft and vandalism represent
the highest remaining event sub-types (similar to
normal society).

HSE&S management
AkzoNobel has a leading HSE&S management system
driving continuous improvement through operational
excellence in all aspects of HSE&S management,
including procedures, training, self-assessments, annual
improvement planning and independent internal audit, as
well as promoting learning across the organziation.
Our common processes require each site and business
unit to develop their own safety improvement plan
annually. Sites that are lagging in performance receive
additional support from the central HSE&S organization.

by almost 20 experts from the academic world, trade
unions, government, industry associations, investors,
NGOs and peer companies
– Numerous randomly selected employees from
different roles, seniority levels, regions, businesses and
departments were asked to share their views on what
they view as potential impacts on human rights by
AkzoNobel, or by others across our value chain
– Two human rights workshops were held with
colleagues in China and India to identify potential
impacts on human rights at regional level
Supply chains
We conducted due diligence research into several raw
material supply chains that are considered high risk in
terms of impacting human rights, particularly with regard
to health and safety, working conditions and under-age
labor. The current raw materials in scope are barite,
cobalt dryers, copper, cotton linters, mica pigments,
palm oil, talc and tin. For example, we are engaging
with our first-tier suppliers of pearlescent pigments
that contain mica to partner on mapping the supply
chain back to the mine of origin, and to make sure that
sufficient due diligence is done on potential human
rights abuses in the supply chain
Sanitary working conditions
We have included a sanitary review in our HSE&S audits

In total, 37 locations have been assessed, of which 90%
scored satisfactory, with no residual high risks to the
health and safety and sanitary working conditions of our

Salient issues - review
Based on the information and insights gathered in 2017,
the Human Rights Committee re-evaluated the salient
issues which were initially identified. Potential human rights
impacts were prioritized by their severity and likelihood.
Our salient issues were adjusted as reflected below, with
the following actions:
• Health and safety in our value chain and connected
communities:
– Business partners: We expect from our business
partners the same level of care for the health and
safety of their employees working for us. We will
continue the study into our high risk raw material
supply chains and continue to improve our supplier
assessment and evaluation framework
– Sale of products: Because of the nature of our
products, we acknowledge there is an inherent risk
of impacting the human rights of the end-users of
our products. In 2018, we will continue with our
proactive approach to the review and management of
hazardous substances in our products (see Note 9)
– Communities: In 2018, we will conduct a study into
the impact we have on communities surrounding
our locations
• Working conditions for employees and our business
partners:
– Business partners: We will continue to assess and
monitor working conditions at our business partners
using our supplier assessment and evaluation
framework and the new business partner compliance
framework

– Own operations: In 2018, the focus of due diligence
actions will be on decent working hours and
living wages
• Discrimination and harassment in our operations:
– We will continue with the implementation of the
mitigating actions (rules, training, coaching) and
measure effectiveness (develop track mechanism)
• Modern slavery in our supply chain:
– We will continue due diligence on high risk raw
material supply chains

Grievance mechanism
We promote a feedback culture through communication
and training. An open atmosphere helps to identify issues,
including concerns relating to respect for human rights.
The SpeakUp! grievance mechanism offers our employees,
business partners and the general public a confidential
environment in which they can raise concerns relating to
breaches of our Code of Conduct, including the human
rights reflected therein. The results are reported annually
(see Compliance and integrity management).

Let’s Colour

Community RePaint
Every year, millions of liters of perfectly good paint are
thrown away. The average household has 17 tins of
paint sitting in garages or sheds, whereas potentially up
to 65% of it could be good enough for reuse. Our
Community RePaint initiative works across the
Netherlands, Belgium and the UK, collecting leftover
reusable paint and re-distributing it to communities,
charities and people in need.

Dulux Academy
Our global “Let’s Colour” program is an active expression
of our belief in the power of paint to improve people’s lives.
During 2017, we launched two new NGO partnerships.
AkzoNobel and SOS Children’s Villages joined forces to
use education and renovation to drive a positive impact
on youth unemployment. The partnership aims to reach
the young people of SOS Children’s Villages with our
“Let’s Colour” program and professional training through
the company’s painter academies around the world. The
partnership kicked off with four countries in 2017 (Brazil,
Indonesia, Nigeria and South Africa) and will expand to
include six new countries in 2018.

Employability is recognized as being a main driver for
strong communities. This is something we are addressing
in the UK, where there are massive skills shortages in the
housing industry. Launched in 2016 and based at our site
in Slough, the Dulux Academy is helping to address this
shortage by upskilling decorators and training those new
to the industry. Since opening, more than 3,000 individuals
have been trained, which means the Dulux Academy is on
track to train 10,000 decorators and apprentices by 2020.
Building on this success, in September we opened a
second Dulux Academy in the UK, based at our new paint
plant in Ashington.

Creating shared value across
three dimensions
Our shared value approach is reflected in the threedimensional profit and loss analysis (3D P&L), measuring
value in economic, environmental and social terms. Our
longer term strategic investment decision-making can
benefit from this analysis. We have used scientific, publicly
available methodologies for our assessment.

In 2017, we updated the 3D P&L assessment (see table
at the top of next page). We continue to work with
others to further develop methodologies and agree on
common approaches.

We have worked with EY to analyze “impact pathways”
from what a program or product does to its desired social
goals, starting with the impact driver (see Value creation
in the Introduction to this section). In the Santa Marta
example (shown on the next page), that first step
on the pathway is professional skills training or renovation
and painting activities. For Dulux Forest Breath (also
shown opposite), it is the reduction of indoor exposure
to formaldehyde.

Input

The outcomes then result in the third step on the
pathway – the societal impacts – which are changes in
society resulting from the activities. For “Let’s Colour”,
this could be changes in the well-being of individuals and
communities. For Dulux Forest Breath, it’s the reduction
of formaldehyde inhalation. Using macro-economic
data, we were able to quantify in monetary terms the
positive impact that our products and programs brought
to society in 2017.

The second step on the impact pathway is the societal
outcome, including the direct effects of the business
activities. For “Let’s Colour”, societal outcomes are the
improvement of skills and self-esteem, and increased (self)
employability opportunities. For Dulux Forest Breath, it’s
the availability of the active substance to clean the
air in painted rooms and so reduce the exposure of
residents to formaldehyde and other organic pollutants.

Assurance report of the independent auditor
To: Supervisory Board and Board of Management
of Akzo Nobel N.V.
Our conclusion
Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention
that causes us to believe the sustainability information
included in the Report 2017 of Akzo Nobel N.V. does not
present, in all material respects, a reliable and adequate
view of:
• The policy and business operations with regard to
sustainability
• The events and achievements related thereto for the
year ended December 31, 2017, in accordance with the
applied reporting criteria developed by AkzoNobel
Our opinion
In our opinion, the paragraphs “Monitoring progress” and
“Management accountability” in the section “Managing
sustainability” are prepared, in all material respects, in
accordance with the applied reporting criteria developed
by AkzoNobel.
What we are assuring
The sustainability information contains a representation of
the policy and business operations of Akzo Nobel N.V.,
Amsterdam, (hereafter: “AkzoNobel”) regarding
sustainability and the events and achievements related
thereto for 2017.
We have reviewed the sustainability information for the year
ended December 31, 2017, as included in the following
sections in the Report 2017 (hereafter: “the sustainability
information”) of AkzoNobel:
• Compliance and integrity management
• Sustainability statements
Additionally, we have audited the paragraphs “Monitoring
progress” and “Management accountability” in the section
“Managing sustainability”.

The links to external sources or websites in the
sustainability information are not part of the Sustainability
statements audited by us. We do not provide assurance
over information outside of this sustainability information.

a comprehensive system of quality control, including
documented policies and procedures regarding compliance
with ethical requirements, professional standards and other
applicable legal and regulatory requirements.

The basis for our conclusion and opinion

Reporting criteria
AkzoNobel developed its reporting criteria, as disclosed in
AkzoNobel’s Reporting Principles 2017. The information
in scope of this assurance engagement needs to be read
and understood in conjunction with the reporting criteria
as disclosed in the Reporting Principles 2017. The Board
of Management is responsible for selecting and applying
these reporting criteria. The absence of a significant body
of established practice on which to draw, to evaluate and
measure non-financial information allows for different,
but acceptable, measurement techniques and can affect
comparability between entities and over time.

We conducted our assurance engagement in accordance
with Dutch law, including the Dutch Standard 3810N
“Assurance engagements on corporate social
responsibility reports” (Assurance-opdrachten inzake
maatschappelijke verslagen), a specified Dutch standard
based on the International Standard on Assurance
Engagements 3000: Assurance Engagements other than
Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information.
This assurance engagement is aimed at providing a
combination of limited assurance on the sustainability
information and reasonable assurance on the “Monitoring
progress” and “Management accountability” paragraphs in
the “Managing sustainability” section. Our responsibilities
under this standard are further described in the section
“Our responsibilities for the assurance engagement of the
sustainability information” of this assurance report.
We believe the assurance information we have obtained
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
conclusion and opinion.
Independence and quality control
We are independent of AkzoNobel in accordance with the
“Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, a regulation
with respect to independence“ (Verordening inzake
de onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assuranceopdrachten - ViO) and other relevant independence
requirements in the Netherlands. Furthermore, we have
complied with the “Code of Ethics for Professional
Accountants, a regulation with respect to rules of
professional conduct” (Verordening gedrags- en beroepsregels accountants - VGBA).
We apply the “detailed rules for quality systems” (Nadere
voorschriften kwaliteitssystemen) and accordingly maintain

AkzoNobel Report 2017

Inherent limitations
The sustainability information includes prospective
information such as expectations on ambitions, strategy,
plans, estimates and risk assessments based on
assumptions. Inherently, the actual results are likely to differ
from these expectations, due to changes in assumptions.
These differences may be material. We do not provide
any assurance on the assumptions and achievability of
prospective information in the sustainability information.

Responsibilities for the sustainability information
and the assurance engagement responsibilities of
the Board of Management
The Board of Management of AkzoNobel is responsible
for the preparation of the sustainability information in
accordance with the criteria as defined in AkzoNobel’s
Reporting Principles 2017, including the identification of
stakeholders and the definition of material topics. The
choices made by the Board of Management regarding
the scope of the sustainability information and the
reporting policy are summarized in the section “Managing
sustainability”. The Board of Management is responsible

Strategic
performance
Our procedures to support our conclusion are aimed at
obtaining limited assurance. In obtaining a limited level
of assurance, the performed procedures are aimed at
determining the plausibility of information and are less
extensive than those aimed at obtaining reasonable
assurance in an assurance engagement. The assurance
obtained in review engagements aimed at obtaining
limited assurance is therefore significantly lower than the
assurance obtained in assurance engagements aimed at
obtaining reasonable assurance.
The procedures to support our opinion on the “Monitoring
progress” and “Management accountability” paragraphs in
the “Managing sustainability” section of the sustainability
information have been performed with a high, but not
absolute level, of assurance. This means we may not have
detected all material misstatements.
Misstatements may arise due to irregularities, including
fraud or error, and are considered to be material if,
individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be
expected to influence the economic decisions of users
taken on the basis of the sustainability information. The
materiality affects the nature, timing and extent of our
assurance engagement and the evaluation of the effect of
identified misstatements on our conclusion and opinion.

Business
performance
Leadership

Our main review procedures include, among others:
• Performing an external environment analysis and
obtaining insight into relevant social themes and issues,
relevant laws and regulations and the characteristics of
the organization
• Identifying and assessing the risks of material
misstatement of the sustainability information, whether
due to errors or fraud, designing and performing review
procedures responsive to those risks, and obtaining
review evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to
provide a basis for our conclusion. The risk of not
detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud
is higher than for one resulting from errors, as fraud
may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control
• Evaluating design/implementation of reporting systems
and processes related to the sustainability information
• Developing an understanding of internal control relevant
to the assurance engagement to design assurance
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances,
but not for the purpose of expressing a conclusion on
the effectiveness of the company’s internal control
• Evaluating the appropriateness of the reporting policy
and its consistent application, including the evaluation
of the results of the stakeholders’ dialog and the
reasonableness of estimates made by management and
related disclosures in the sustainability information
• Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and
content of the sustainability information, including the
disclosures
• Evaluating whether the sustainability information
represents the underlying transactions and events free
from material misstatement

Governance and
compliance

Our responsibilities for the assurance engagement
of the sustainability information
Our responsibility is to plan and perform an assurance
engagement to allow us to obtain sufficient and
appropriate assurance evidence to provide a basis for our
conclusion and opinion.

• Interviewing management (or relevant staff) at corporate
and local level responsible for the sustainability strategy
and policy
• Interviewing relevant staff at corporate level responsible
for providing the sustainability information, carrying
out internal control procedures on the data and
consolidating the data in the sustainability information
• Joining internal audit of Health, Safety and Environment
management at production sites in Delfzijl (Netherlands)
• An analytical review of the data and trends submitted for
consolidation at corporate level
• Reviewing internal and external documentation to
determine if the sustainability information, including the
disclosure, presentation and assertions made in the
sustainability information, is substantiated adequately
• Assessing the consistency of the sustainability
information and the information in the Report 2017 not
in scope for this assurance report
• Assessing whether the sustainability information has
been prepared in accordance with the AkzoNobel
sustainability reporting criteria
• Reviewing relevant work of the Internal Audit function
In addition to the above, we performed the following
assurance procedures on the paragraphs “Monitoring
progress” and “Management accountability” in the section
“Managing sustainability” of the sustainability information:
• Corroborating information disclosed in this note through
multiple interviews with selected staff from the company
• Testing operating effectiveness of relevant key controls
related to how AkzoNobel manages its sustainability
agenda
• Corroborating supporting documentation to determine
whether the information in this note is substantiated
adequately, such as management meeting agendas and
minutes and internal management information.

Financial
information

The Board of Management is also responsible for such
internal control as it determines is necessary to enable
the preparation of the sustainability information that is free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Procedures performed
We have exercised professional judgement and
maintained professional scepticism throughout the
assurance engagement, in accordance with the Dutch
Standard 3810N, ethical requirements and independence
requirements.
