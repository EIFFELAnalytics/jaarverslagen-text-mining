1 Message from the CEO
“ I am pleased with our transformation progress to become a
focused leader in health technology and see tremendous
further potential to grow Philips’ market positions and
expand margins.” Frans van Houten, CEO Royal Philips
Dear Stakeholder,
2017 was a good year of solid progress for Philips, as we
continued our transformation to become a focused
leader in health technology and delivered on our
improvement targets for the year. In line with our
commitments we delivered 4% comparable sales
growth1, resulting in a 10-basis-point gain in market
share. We also improved operating profitability, with an
Adjusted EBITA1 margin increase of 110 basis points, and
generated a strong EUR 1.2 billion free cash flow1. This
underscores our ability to stay the course, in this case
against a background of challenging economic
circumstances in Europe and considerable uncertainty
in the US around healthcare policy.
Our organic growth initiatives are delivering tangible
results. Overall we recorded 6% order growth for the
year. In Diagnostic Imaging, for instance, we ended the
year with high-single-digit order growth and realized
market share gains in China and India, driven by the
renewal of 60% of our portfolio. We also noted a strong
increase in order intake in our Digital Pathology
Solutions business, double-digit growth of our Sleep &
Respiratory Care devices, and the continued success of
our OneBlade hybrid facial hair styler. And we
introduced several important innovations, gained
traction with our solutions approach – securing
multiple long-term strategic partnerships – and
continued to invest in quality and talent.
We further strengthened our portfolio through targeted
acquisitions, the largest being Spectranetics, a global
leader in vascular intervention and lead management
solutions. The integration of these acquisitions is on
track. Toward the end of the year we deconsolidated
Philips Lighting as we reduced our shareholding to
below 30%, in line with our stated aim to fully sell down
our stake.
2017 saw the completion of the industry reclassification
of our stock to Healthcare at all major indices. Our
customers and the financial markets appreciate the
way we have pivoted and executed on our strategic
roadmap. And we increased our brand value to USD 11.5
billion in the 2017 Interbrand ranking.

1

4

Continuing to drive our five-year ‘Healthy people,
sustainable planet’ program, with its focus on Circular
Economy, Access to Care and Climate Action, we
improved the lives of 2.2 billion people around the
world in 2017, and we again received top rankings from
leading indices such as the Dow Jones Sustainability
Index and the Carbon Disclosure Project. At the United
Nations in September we made an extended
commitment to improve the lives of 300 million people
in underserved healthcare communities by 2025.
Overall, I am pleased with the progress we made in
2017. Our purpose is very clear. We are here to improve
health and healthcare through innovations! We have a
vibrant, highly committed workforce, with employee
engagement consistently above the high-performing
norm and rising from 74% to 76% this year. We have
good momentum on our way to position ourselves for
a future with higher growth and earnings potential.
Clearly, we can still improve operational excellence:
making further progress on product performance and
our commitment to quality is our highest priority for
2018. However, I am very confident in our ability to
capture the opportunities and deal with the challenges
ahead, as we work toward our goal of improving the
lives of 3 billion people a year by 2025.
Innovating with purpose
In the face of growing and aging populations, the rise
of chronic diseases, and global resource constraints,
health systems the world over are under enormous
strain. Digital technology is transforming the healthcare
industry, increasingly shifting value towards software
and services. It also has the potential to enable more
and more people to actively take ownership of their
health and well-being.
For Philips – with leadership positions in both personal
health and professional healthcare – we see that
innovation can transform the delivery of care across the
health continuum, enabling new relationships between
care providers and patients/consumers, and driving
better patient outcomes, higher productivity and a
better user experience for all concerned.

Annual Report 2017

Message from the CEO 1

We are driving this transformation in different ways:
• By offering consumers connected solutions – like our
Sonicare DiamondClean Smart oral care and
DreamWear sleep therapy solutions – that support
superior preventive care and those living with chronic
disease respectively.
• By giving clinicians the solutions they need to
perform care with better outcomes and higher
productivity, such as our Healthcare Informatics
solutions. These support first-time-right diagnosis
and increase productivity by integrating radiology,
pathology and genomics information at the point of
care, with AI-driven clinical decision support.
• By empowering clinicians to deliver precision
treatments supported by ground-breaking
innovations for image-guided therapies, including
our advanced live image-guidance solutions, hybrid
operating rooms and smart devices such as our
diagnostic and therapeutic catheters.
• By enabling the seamless flow of data needed to care
for patients in real time wherever they are, by ‘joining
up the dots’ from the ICU to the home with our
HealthSuite digital platforms and patient monitoring
solutions, again supported by powerful algorithms
that can predict adverse patient incidents hours in
advance.
All of this with the objective of supporting the shift to
value-based healthcare, a model that aims to improve
patient outcomes while at the same time increasing
productivity – that is innovation with purpose. And
there’s more to come from our pipeline, thanks to our
consistently high levels of investment in R&D, where
some 60% of our people are focused on software and
data science.
The road forward
Looking ahead, we see significant opportunities to
further increase the value we deliver – by boosting
growth in our existing core business, growing in
adjacencies, and driving customer and operational
excellence. We know that our strategy has traction, so
now it is execution that matters most.
Boosting growth in core business
One of the ways we will capture new growth in our core
business is by continuing to leverage products and
solutions that have worked well in mature markets and
bringing them to growth geographies where we have a
strong footprint and brand recognition – as we have
done with our Sonicare power toothbrushes in China.
In addition, we are increasingly partnering with hospital
customers in new business models, engaging in longterm strategic partnerships to innovate value-added,
integrated solutions that deliver better outcomes and
higher productivity.

We now have over 110 of these long-term partnerships,
up from 60-plus in 2016, and the number continues to
rise. The combination of compelling solutions and
consultative partnership contracts drives aboveaverage growth rates and a higher proportion of
recurring revenues.
Growing in adjacencies
We have completed two substantial M&A transactions
over the last few years, Volcano and Spectranetics.
These were targeted to meet our strategic objectives,
to complement our leadership in cardiovascular
interventions with smart devices, so that we can
support complete vascular procedures. Volcano has
worked out very well, having risen to double-digit
growth and much improved profitability since we
integrated the business; and we have similar
expectations of Spectranetics, as we leverage our postmerger integration capabilities to unlock maximum
value.
Another route to growth in adjacencies is through
organic growth and investments in R&D. To extend our
strong portfolio in patient monitoring, for example, we
have invested in medical-grade wearables so that
patients don’t need to be wired up but can be
continuously measured, wherever they are. We
continue to invest in Digital Pathology, as we believe
the digitization of tissue slides is going to completely
transform the clinical practice of pathology. We are
pleased we are now able to market our IntelliSite
Pathology Solution for primary diagnostic use in the
USA, and we have since seen a sharp increase in order
growth.
At the same time, we do not need to do everything
ourselves. In 2017, for example, we entered into a
partnership with B. Braun to innovate and accelerate
growth in ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia and
vascular access. And we have a host of other valueadding alliances where we have decided we can better
expand our capabilities through partnering, rather than
going it alone.
Continuing the digital transformation of Philips is
absolutely fundamental to our future. We continue to
invest in our secure HealthSuite digital eco-system
platform – to enable digital health propositions that
connect consumers and doctors to Philips through the
cloud, enabling new business models and unlocking
new revenue streams. We currently have over 30 cloudconnected propositions in the market.
Today, we sell a large proportion of our Personal Health
products through online channels, aided by digital
marketing. And now we are transferring that marketing
capability to our health systems channels, so that we
become more effective at reaching healthcare
professionals. We are also connecting our back-office
systems to our customers to enable new recurring

Annual Report 2017

revenue streams and enhanced customer loyalty in
Software as a Service and Product as a Service business
models.
Driving customer and operational excellence
To ensure that our solutions are truly customer-centric,
we use ‘design thinking’ and our proven ‘Co-create’
methodology, whereby we come together with
healthcare professionals to explore how our combined
knowledge, resources and shared vision could improve
the delivery of care.
In our drive for operational excellence we continue with
disciplined implementation of the Philips Business
System and Lean principles. The adoption of Hoshin
methodology to plan and drive execution has yielded
significant gains across the group. Our productivity
measures will add up to over EUR 1.2 billion over the
three-year period 2017-2019, having delivered around
EUR 480 million in 2017.
We continue to drive quality and regulatory
performance improvement throughout the company.
Nevertheless, we did not fully deliver to our 2017 plan
as we continue to address two significant regulatory
challenges that arose from years ago. We must
continue our improvement journey forcefully.
Building on the strong 6% order growth for the full year
2017, consistent execution on these value drivers will
enable us to deliver, in 2018, on our medium-term
targets of 4-6% comparable sales growth1 and an
average annual improvement in Adjusted EBITA1
margin of 100 basis points.
In conclusion
We have made strong progress in our transformation to
become a focused leader in health technology. Going
forward, we are committed to single-mindedly improve
performance and attain higher levels of growth. To this
end we are continuing to strengthen our culture –
putting our customers first, acting with quality and
integrity, teaming up to win, taking ownership to deliver
fast, and learning, improving and inspiring each other,
every step of the way.
I am confident that, by doing so, we will be able to
expand our strong positions across the health
continuum, extend our solutions capability to address
our customers’ unmet needs, and deliver the full
benefits of data-enabled connected care.
It only remains for me to thank our customers,
shareholders and other stakeholders for the support
they continue to give us. And to thank our Philips
people around the world for their tremendous
engagement and efforts over the past year.

Our strategic focus 2

2 Our strategic focus
2.1 Addressing health challenges through innovation
All around the world, resource constraints are driving a
shift to value-based healthcare – a system that aims to
increase access to care and improve patient outcomes
while also raising cost productivity. At the same time,
aging populations and the rise of chronic diseases like
heart disease and respiratory conditions are driving up
demand for healthcare.
In parallel, a growing focus on healthy living and
prevention means more and more people are looking
for new ways to proactively monitor and manage their
health, also in home and community settings. And the
digitalization of healthcare has reached the point
where value is shifting from stand-alone products to
solutions combining systems, smart devices, software
and services, which deliver greater benefits to
customers.
Philips sees significant value in more integrated forms
of healthcare, unlocking the power of data and artificial
intelligence at the point of care, while at the same time
optimizing care delivery across the health continuum.
This includes putting increased emphasis on both
primary and secondary prevention and population
health management programs.
At Philips, we are striving to make the world healthier
and more sustainable through innovation, with the goal
of improving the lives of 3 billion people a year by 2025.
In today’s increasingly connected world, the
convergence of Philips’ consumer technologies that
facilitate healthy living, medical technologies that help
clinicians to deliver better diagnosis and treatment, and
cloud-based technologies that support data sharing
and analysis, will be a key enabler of more effective,
lower-cost integrated health solutions.

Healthy living

Prevention

We like to visualize healthcare as a continuum since it
suggests the notion of continuous care. And it becomes
very compelling when one thinks of this continuum as
being connected.
By addressing healthcare as a ‘connected whole’ in this
way, we can unlock gains and efficiencies and drive
innovations that help deliver on the ‘quadruple aim’:
enhancing the patient experience, improving health
outcomes, lowering the cost of care, and improving the
work life of care providers.
With our global reach, deep insights and leading
innovations, we are uniquely positioned in ‘the last
yard’ to consumers and care providers, delivering:
• connected products and services supporting the
health and well-being of people
• integrated modalities and clinical informatics to
deliver definitive diagnosis
• real-time guidance and smart devices for minimally
invasive interventions
• connected therapeutic products and services for
chronic care patients.
Underpinning these solutions, and spanning the health
continuum, our connected care and health informatics
solutions enable us to:
• connect patients and providers for more effective,
coordinated, personalized care
• manage population health, leveraging real-time
patient data and clinical analytics.
We are focusing on end-to-end pathways – at present
primarily cardiology, oncology, respiratory care, and
pregnancy and parenting – where we believe our
integral approach can add even greater value for our
customers.

2.2 How we create value
Meeting people’s unmet needs
At Philips, value creation always starts with listening to
people in local markets – consumers, doctors, nurses,
hospital executives and administrators – so we
understand the specific challenges they face in their
day-to-day work.
This gives us a deep insight into their needs and
aspirations. We then apply our innovative
competencies, strong brand, global footprint and
talented, engaged people – often in long-term
partnerships – to deliver solutions that meet these
needs, making the world healthier and more
sustainable.
To measure the impact we are having around the world,
we have developed our independently verified Lives
Improved model. We take a two-dimensional approach
– social and ecological – to improving people’s lives.
Products and solutions that directly support the
curative (care) or preventive (well-being) side of
people’s health, determine the contribution to the
social dimension. The contribution to the ecological
dimension is determined by means of our Green
Products and Solutions portfolio.

Our business system
With its four interlocking elements, the Philips Business
System (PBS) is designed to help us deliver on our
mission and vision – and to ensure that success is
repeatable. As we execute our strategy and invest in the
best opportunities, leverage our unique strengths and
become operationally excellent, we will be able to
consistently deliver value to our customers, consumers
and other stakeholders.
• Strategy – Where we invest: We manage our
businesses with clearly defined strategies to deliver
solutions across the health continuum and allocate
resources to maximize value creation.
• Capabilities, Assets and Positions – Our unique
strengths: We strengthen and leverage our core
Capabilities, Assets and Positions – our deep
customer insights, technological innovation, global
footprint, our people, and the trusted Philips brand –
as they create differential value.
• Excellence – How we operate: We are a learning
organization that applies common operating
principles and practices to deliver to our customers
with excellence.
• Path to Value – What we deliver: We define and
execute business plans that deliver sustainable
results along a credible Path to Value.
The ‘Creating value for our stakeholders’ diagram,
based on the International Integrated Reporting
Council framework, shows how – with the Philips
Business System at the heart of our endeavors – we use
six different forms of capital to drive value in the short,
medium and long term. All numbers are for the year
ended December 31, 2017.

“ 2017 was a year of solid progress, as we generated sales of
EUR 17.8 billion underpinned by a 4% comparable sales
growth, improved our operating profitability margin by 110
basis points, delivered a strong operating cash flow of EUR
1.9 billion, reduced our interest expenses by over EUR 100

operations to EUR 1,028 million.” Abhijit Bhattacharya, CFO Royal Philips
3.1 Financial performance
Management summary
• Sales rose to EUR 17.8 billion, a nominal increase of
2%, which reflected 3% nominal growth in the
Personal Health businesses and Diagnosis &
Treatment businesses and flat year-on-year sales in
the Connected Care & Health Informatics businesses.
On a comparable basis1) the 4% growth was driven by
6% growth in the Personal Health businesses and 3%
growth in the Connected Care & Health Informatics
and Diagnosis & Treatment businesses.
• As of December 31, 2017, Philips’ shareholding in
Philips Lighting was decreased to 29.01% of Philips
Lighting’s issued share capital. As a result, Philips no
longer has control over Philips Lighting and has
ceased to consolidate Philips Lighting. With the
completion of this transaction, Philips reached an

• Net income amounted to EUR 1.9 billion and
increased by EUR 379 million compared to 2016,
driven by improvements in operational performance,
lower net financial expenses and higher discontinued
operations results, partly offset by higher
restructuring and acquisition-related charges and
higher income taxes, which included a tax charge of
EUR 171 million due to the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
Net income is not allocated to segments as certain
income and expense line items are monitored on a

productivity programs delivered annual savings of
approximately EUR 483 million, ahead of the
targeted savings of EUR 400 million, and included
approximately EUR 260 million procurement
savings, led by the Design for Excellence (DfX)
program, and EUR 223 million savings from other
productivity programs.
• Net cash provided by operating activities amounted
to EUR 1.9 billion and increased by EUR 700 million
compared to 2016. Free cash flow1) amounted to EUR
1.2 billion and increased by EUR 756 million
compared to 2016. The increase was mainly driven by
higher earnings and the dividend related to the
retained interest in the combined businesses of
Lumileds and Automotive, lower outflows related to
pension de-risking settlements, as well as the cash
outflows in Q4 2016 of EUR 280 million related to the
Masimo agreements. For further information on the
Masimo agreements, refer to note 19, Provisions.
• On June 28, 2017, Royal Philips announced a EUR 1.5
billion share buyback program. Philips started the
program in the third quarter of 2017 and continues to
make progress. As the program was initiated for
capital reduction purposes, Philips intends to cancel
all of the shares acquired under the program.
• In line with our mission to improve people’s lives, we
have embedded sustainability at the heart of our
business processes, and Philips was named industry
leader in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the
3rd year in a row. In the Carbon Disclosure Project, we
achieved the highest score for the 5th year in a row.
Green Revenues, including products and solutions
sales, increased to 60% of total revenues in 2017.

3.1.1 Philips Lighting sell-down
In September 2014, Philips announced its plan to
sharpen its strategic focus by establishing two standalone companies focused on the HealthTech and
Lighting opportunities respectively. To this end, a
stand-alone structure was established for Philips
Lighting within the Philips Group, effective February 1,
2016. Then, on May 27, 2016, Philips Lighting was listed
and started trading on Euronext in Amsterdam under
the symbol ‘LIGHT’. Following the listing of Philips
Lighting, Philips retained a 71.23% stake. The Initial
Public Offering resulted in a net cash inflow of EUR 863
million and an increase of shareholders’ equity of EUR
109 million.

In November 2017, by selling another 17.1 million shares,
Philips lost control, resulting in the deconsolidation of
Philips Lighting. The sale of shares resulted in a net cash
inflow of EUR 544 million and a gain of EUR 599 million
recognized in Discontinued operations.
As of December 31, 2017, the retained interest in Philips
Lighting represents a value of EUR 1,264 million. Philips
will sell down its retained interest in Philips Lighting
within one year and it is therefore presented under
Assets classified as held for sale. The current position
of 29.01% is a temporary position which fits in our
overall single coordinated plan to sell Philips Lighting
in its entirety. Consequently, any future results related
to the retained interest – like value adjustments, results
upon disposal and dividends – will be reflected in
Discontinued operations.
Subsequent to deconsolidation, Philips recognized a
valuation loss of EUR 104 million in discontinued
operations related to the retained interest, reflecting
the stock price developments of Philips Lighting until
December 31, 2017.

In the course of 2017, Philips successfully completed
three accelerated bookbuild offerings to institutional
investors of a total of 65.35 million shares in Philips
Lighting, gradually reducing Philips’ stake in Philips
Lighting’s issued share capital to 29.01% by the end of
2017.
The first two transactions in February and April 2017,
involving 48.25 million shares, resulted in a net cash
inflow of EUR 1,065 million and had a positive impact
on shareholders’ equity of the Company of EUR 327
million. In April 2017, we concluded that a loss of control
was highly probable due to further sell-downs of the
remaining shares within one year. From that date
Lighting was presented as a discontinued operation.

Connected Care & Health Informatics businesses. The
increase was driven by double-digit growth in Middle
East & Turkey and high-single-digit growth in China,

Net interest expense in 2017 was EUR 117 million lower
than in 2016, mainly driven by lower interest expenses
on net debt1), as a result of the bond redemptions. Other
financial income amounted to EUR 46 million in 2017,
mainly due to dividend income related to the retained
interest in the combined businesses of Lumileds and
Automotive. For further information, refer to note 7,
Financial income and expenses.

Income taxes
Income taxes amounted to EUR 349 million, compared
to EUR 203 million in 2016. The effective income tax rate
in 2017 was 25.3%, compared to 19.9% in 2016. This
increase was largely due to a tax charge of EUR 72
million for a valuation adjustment of Philips’ US
deferred tax assets following the enactment of the US
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017.
For 2018, we expect our effective tax rate to be within
the range of 26%-28%, depending on the geographical
mix of taxable income.

Investment in associates
Results related to investments in associates decreased
from a gain of EUR 11 million in 2016 to a loss of EUR 4
million in 2017, mainly due to an impairment of EUR 4
million and lower share of income of associates in 2017
compared to 2016.

Discontinued operations
Discontinued operations consist primarily of the
segment Lighting, the combined Lumileds and
Automotive businesses, and certain divestments
formerly reported as discontinued operations. The
results related to these businesses are reported under
Discontinued operations in the Consolidated
statements of income and Consolidated statements of
cash flows.
In 2017, Philips completed several transactions in
Philips Lighting shares, which reduced the interest in
this company from 71.23% as of December 31, 2016 to
29.01% as of December 31, 2017. In April 2017, triggered
by a sale of Philips Lighting shares, we concluded that
a loss of control was highly probable due to further selldowns of the remaining shares within one year. From
that date Lighting was presented as a discontinued
operation. In November 2017 Philips lost control,
resulting in the deconsolidation of Philips Lighting.

except for the net interest cost component which is
reported in Financial expense. The net interest cost for
defined-benefit plans was EUR 37 million in 2017.

leading to a decrease of the defined-benefit obligation
of EUR 345 million and the recognition of a settlement
loss of EUR 1 million.

2016 included a legal claim settlement gain of EUR 46
million related to the UK pension plan.
The overall funded status and balance sheet improved
in 2016, mainly due to contributions of EUR 250 million
in the US, partly offset by an increase of the definedbenefit obligation due to lower discount rates.
For further information, refer to note 20, Postemployment benefits.

Non-controlling interests
Net income attributable to non-controlling interests
increased from EUR 43 million in 2016 to EUR 214
million in 2017, mainly as a result of three sales
transactions in Philips Lighting shares, which reduced

Annual Report 2017

In 2016, total debt decreased by EUR 154 million
compared to 2015. New borrowings of EUR 1,304 million
were mainly due to new loan facilities for Philips
Lighting of EUR 740 million and USD 500 million to
replace intragroup financing from Royal Philips.
Repayments amounted to EUR 1,681 million, mainly
due to the repayment of a USD 1,300 million bridge loan
used for the Volcano acquisition, as well as the early
redemption of USD 285 million in the aggregate
principal amount of USD bonds. Other changes
resulting from consolidation and currency effects led to
an increase of EUR 223 million.

New borrowings/repayments
short-term debt

due to the early redemption of the 5.750% bonds due

are mainly related to the EUR 1.5 billion share buyback
program for capital reduction purposes announced on
June 28, 2017 and are recorded as a financial liability
under Long-term and Short-term debt. Other changes
mainly resulting from consolidation and currency
effects led to a decrease of EUR 347 million. EUR 1,342
million was transferred to Liabilities directly associated
with assets held for sale, mainly Lighting debt.

At the end of 2017, long-term debt as a proportion of
the total debt stood at 86% with an average

Net available liquidity resources

Group performance 3.1.10

As at December 31, 2017, the reduction in net available
liquidity resources compared to 2016 was mainly driven
by the refinancing of the revolving credit facility and the
transfer of the net liquidity of Philips Lighting (including
cash and cash equivalents, short-term debt and longterm debt) into Discontinued operations.
Royal Philips has a EUR 1 billion committed revolving
credit facility which was signed in April 2017 and will
mature in April 2022. The facility can be used for general
group purposes, such as a backstop of its Commercial
Paper Programme.
The Commercial Paper Programme amounts to USD 2.5
billion, under which Royal Philips can issue commercial
paper up to 364 days in tenor, both in the US and in
Europe, in any major freely convertible currency. As of
December 31, 2017, Royal Philips did not have any loans
outstanding under these facilities.
Additionally, Philips held EUR 49 million of equity
investments in available-for-sale financial assets (fair
value at December 31, 2017). Refer to note 13, Other
financial assets. Furthermore, Philips is also a
shareholder in Philips Lighting (EUR 1,264 million at
year-end 2017) which is publicly listed and classified as
asset held for sale.
Royal Philips’ existing long-term debt is rated A- (with
stable outlook) by Fitch, Baa1 (with stable outlook) by
Moody’s, and BBB+ (with stable outlook) by Standard
& Poor’s. Our net debt1) position is managed in such a
way that we seek to retain a strong investment grade
credit rating. Furthermore, the Group’s aim when
managing the net debt1) position is dividend stability
and a pay-out ratio of 40% to 50% of continuing net
income after adjustments. Royal Philips’ outstanding
long-term debt and credit facilities do not contain
financial covenants. Adverse changes in the Company’s
ratings will not trigger automatic withdrawal of
committed credit facilities nor any acceleration in the
outstanding long-term debt (provided that the USDdenominated bonds contain a ‘Change of Control
Triggering Event’ and the EUR-denominated bonds
contain a ‘Change of Control Put Event’). A description
of Philips’ credit facilities can be found in note 18, Debt.
As at January 20, 2017, Philips early-redeemed the
outstanding 5.750% bonds due 2018 having an
aggregate principal amount of USD 1,250 million.
As at September 6, 2017, Philips successfully issued
EUR 500 million floating-rate bonds due 2019 and EUR
500 million fixed-rate bonds due 2023. The net
proceeds of the offering were used for the refinancing
of the EUR 1 billion loan which was entered into for the
purpose of financing the acquisition of Spectranetics
and for general purposes.

1)

Philips pools cash from subsidiaries to the extent
legally and economically feasible. Cash not pooled
remains available for local operational or investment
needs. The company also faces cross-border foreign
exchange controls and/or other legal restrictions in a
few countries which could limit its ability to make these
balances available on short notice for general use by
the group.
Philips believes its current liquidity and direct access to
capital markets is sufficient to meet its present financing
requirements.

3.1.11 Shareholders’ equity
Shareholders’ equity decreased by EUR 547 million in
2017 to EUR 11,999 million at December 31, 2017. The
decrease was mainly due to the negative impact of
currency translation differences of EUR 984 million,
share repurchases made in the open market over the
course of the year, the purchase of forward contracts of
EUR 1,079 million, and dividend payments to
shareholders of Koninklijke Philips N.V. of EUR 384
million (including tax and service charges). This was
mainly offset by net results of EUR 1,870 million and the
sale of Philips Lighting shares of EUR 327 million.
The number of outstanding common shares of Royal
Philips at December 31, 2017 was 926 million (2016: 922
million). At the end of 2017, the Company held 14.7
million shares in treasury to cover the future delivery of
shares (2016: 7.2 million shares). This was in connection
with the 20.8 million rights outstanding at the end of
2017 (2016: 33.5 million rights) under the Company’s
long-term incentive plans. At the end of 2017, the
Company held 4.6 million shares for cancellation (2016:
0 shares). In 2016, Philips purchased call options on
Philips shares to hedge the majority of the options
granted to employees until 2013. As of December 31,
2017 Philips held 6.3 million call options as a hedge of
6.8 million remaining options granted to employees. In
order to hedge share buy-back commitments, Philips
also entered into several forward contracts in 2017. The
total of forward contracts amounted to EUR 1.1 billion in
2017, of which EUR 60 million matured in 2017.

3.1.12 Cash obligations
Contractual cash obligations
The table below presents a summary of the Group’s fixed
contractual cash obligations and commitments at
December 31, 2017. These amounts are an estimate of
future payments, which could change as a result of various
factors such as a change in interest rates, contractual
provisions, as well as changes in our business strategy and
needs. Therefore, the actual payments made in future
periods may vary from those presented in the table below:

Purchase obligations are agreements to purchase goods or services that

significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased,
fixed, minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing
of the transaction. They do not include open purchase orders or other
commitments which do not specify all significant terms.

Philips has no material commitments for capital
expenditures.
Certain Philips suppliers factor their trade receivables
from Philips with third parties through supplier finance
arrangements. At December 31, 2017 approximately
EUR 286 million of the Philips accounts payable were
known to have been sold onward under such
arrangements whereby Philips confirms invoices.
Philips continues to recognize these liabilities as trade
payables and will settle the liabilities in line with the
original payment terms of the related invoices.

Other cash commitments
The Company and its subsidiaries sponsor postemployment benefit plans in many countries in
accordance with legal requirements, customs and the
local situation in the countries involved. For a
discussion of the plans and expected cash outflows,
please refer to note 20, Post-employment benefits.
The Company had EUR 112 million restructuring-related
provisions by the end of 2017, of which EUR 87 million
is expected to result in cash outflows in 2018. Refer to
note 19, Provisions for details of restructuring
provisions.
A proposal will be submitted to the upcoming Annual
General Meeting of Shareholders to declare a dividend

if all shareholders would elect cash), in cash or shares
at the option of the shareholder, against the net income
for 2017. Further details will be given in the agenda for
the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, to be held
on May 3, 2018.

Guarantees
Philips’ policy is to provide guarantees and other letters
of support only in writing. Philips does not provide other
forms of support. The total fair value of guarantees
recognized on the balance sheet amounts to EUR nil
million for both 2016 and 2017. Remaining off-balancesheet business and credit-related guarantees provided
on behalf of third parties and associates decreased by
EUR 11 million during 2017 to EUR 17 million (December
31, 2016: EUR 28 million).

3.1.13 Procurement
In spite of a challenging market environment, Philips
came through with the 2017 procurement performance
commitment. These results were driven by optimizing
costs via various programs, including many DfX events,
Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) programs and
negotiations to secure the best possible outcome and
overcome market headwinds.
Global growth is strengthening but the longer-term
challenges remain. Policy stimulus supported the
upturn, but the private investment recovery was
modest. Continued reliance on credit to fund growth is
heightening the risk of an eventual adjustment in China.
In addition, a further shift toward protectionist policies
in the US and a growing trend in Europe is a distinct
threat. The currency risk remains in 2018 as the euro
appreciated strongly against the US dollar and Chinese
renminbi in 2017. Geopolitical tensions, terrorism and
the European challenge with refugees could also play
a key role in the outlook in several economies.
The higher commodity market prices over the last year
created a challenging environment for Philips. The
situation in 2018 will remain the same or will be more
challenging, judging by the continuation of the
economic improvement, speculation on further pick-up
in commodity demand, and actual material market
price increases over 2017. The low price levels of raw
materials and energy during the period 2015-2016 have
led to reduced investment in future supply. This creates
the risk of new headwinds once real consumption picks
up significantly again and the supply-demand situation
reverses.

3.1.14 Real estate
Philips is present in more than 75 countries globally and
has its corporate headquarters located in Amsterdam,
the Netherlands. In 2017, we further increased the
efficiency of our global Real Estate footprint by
reducing the space provision by approximately 8%. Our
real estate sites are spread across the globe, with key
manufacturing and R&D sites in the Americas, Asia and
Europe. As our company is very dynamic in streamlining
and developing its business portfolio, the real estate

Group performance 3.1.14

activities go hand-in-hand with that. In 2017, we made
several adjustments to our footprint in the US (i.e.
Foster City Pittsburgh, Nashville Tennessee, and
Cambridge Massachusetts), but also in India (i.e.
Chennai, Bangalore) and China (i.e. Shanghai), to
optimize our global business solutions. We also
rightsized and upgraded our Paris and Warsaw offices
in EMEA and started to build our global business
solutions in India, Poland and the United States. To
attract new R&D talent we grew locations in Foster City,
Bangalore, Pittsburgh, Moscow and others. With all
these adjustments we have established a better
balanced real estate footprint globally, which also
enables our businesses to be close to their customer
base. The vast majority of our locations consist of
leased property, and we manage these closely to keep
the overall vacancy rates of our property below 3% and
to ensure that the right level of space efficiency and
flexibility is in place to follow our business
developments. The net book value of our land and
buildings as at December 31, 2017, represented EUR 584
million, and construction in progress represented EUR
31 million. Our current facilities are in generally good
operating condition and are adequate to meet the
requirements of our present and foreseeable future
operations.

3.1.15 Analysis of 2016 compared to 2015
The analysis of the 2016 financial results compared to
2015, and the discussion of the critical accounting
policies, have not been included in this Annual Report.
These sections are included in Philips’ Form 20-F for
the financial year 2017, which will be filed electronically
with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

3.2 Social performance
We are a purpose-driven company, aiming to improve
the lives of 3 billion people annually by 2025. Our
people find this purpose powerful, drawing inspiration
from the societal impact we achieve. We have a highly
engaged and committed workforce; our employee
engagement score is consistently above the highperforming norm of 69%, rising from 71% in 2015, to 76%
this year.
Our people strategy supports a constantly evolving
workforce, capable of delivering strong business
performance and executing our strategy. As such we
focus on our Workforce of the Future, and our deep
commitment to Inclusion and Diversity across our
workforce, supported by a Culture of Performance. The
future will require a new type of networked
organization, where teams dynamically draw from
across the organization and unite around a common
purpose.

3.2.1 Improving people’s lives

guide our efforts and measure our progress, we take a
two-dimensional approach – social and ecological – to
improving people’s lives. Solutions from our portfolio
that directly support the curative or preventive side of
people’s health determine the contribution to the social
dimension. This is also our contribution to the UN
Sustainable Development Goal 3 (“to ensure healthy
lives and promote well-being for all at all ages”). As
healthy ecosystems are also needed for people to live
a healthy life, the contribution to the ecological
dimension is determined by means of our steadily
growing Green Solutions portfolio, such as our energy
efficient products in our Personal Health businesses.
This is our contribution to Sustainable Development
Goal 12 (“to ensure sustainable consumption and
production patterns”).
Through Philips products and solutions that support
people’s health, we improved the lives of 1.34 billion
people in 2017 (2016: 1.22 billion), driven by all
segments. Our Green Solutions (including Philips
Lighting) that contribute to a healthy ecosystem
contributed 1.86 billion lives. After the elimination of
double counts – people touched multiple times – we
arrived at 2.2 billion lives. This is an increase of around
100 million compared to 2016, driven by all segments,
mainly in China, India, and North America.
In 2014, Philips pledged to support the United Nation’s
Every Woman Every Child initiative, committing to
improve the lives of at least 100 million women and
children in Africa and South East Asia by 2025. At the
United Nations General Assembly week in September
2017, Philips made an extended commitment to
improve the lives of 300 million people in underserved
healthcare communities by 2025. Philips thereby
recognized the often critical needs of women and
children in many communities, but also the added
burden arising from the increase in non-communicable
diseases (NCDs) in communities already struggling
without adequate access to healthcare. To monitor our
progress on the extended commitment, we use the
same Lives Improved methodology and in 2017 we
improved the lives of 153 million people in underserved
markets (an increase of 16 million compared to 2016).
More information on this metric can be found in
Methodology for calculating Lives Improved.

manage workforce demand holistically through

3.2.3 Inclusion & Diversity
At Philips, we believe that our workforce should be a
reflection of the society in which we operate, a
reflection of our customers, and the markets we serve.

1.3

We value our full workforce in all aspects of diversity,
whether generational, gender, experience, ethnicity,
race, sexual orientation, ability, nationality, or other
aspects, and believe that an inclusive culture invites a
full spectrum of ideas, opinions, and experiences into
the decision making.

Total: 2.2 billion (double counts eliminated)

We believe in fairness, that all individuals have the
opportunity to be successful, to be heard and to be
valued, without prejudice, and we will strive for this to
be felt across Philips. We believe that an inclusive
culture and diverse workforce correlates to high
performance, and therefore consider improvements in
Inclusion & Diversity as a key opportunity for
sustainable improvements in business performance.

3.2.2 Workforce of the Future
Changing workforce demographics, the dynamic
business environment and limited availability of
strategic skill sets mean that we need to focus on
building strategic capabilities that we can offer through
location and work arrangements. In 2017 we deepened
our Strategic workforce planning practices across our
businesses, geographies, and functions and continue to
expand on our strategic people’s practices, alongside
business strategy and financials.
In Q3 2017 we addressed holistic workforce
management, bringing all contingent workers under the
responsibility of the HR function and recognizing the
significant contribution of the skills and competencies
that contingent workers offer. In 2018 we will further

Fostering Inclusion & Diversity will bring deeper
customer insight from a place of understanding, which
enables faster and more targeted responses to market
changes, ultimately contributing to our collective ability
to work together to deliver improved value to our
customers.
In 2017 we set a renewed and enhanced intention for
Inclusion & Diversity with a number of activations; we
set a target for 25% gender diversity of senior leadership
by 2020 and provided dashboards for our HR leaders
to be able to track diversity for their organizations. We

agreed principles of transparency for appointment and
promotion opportunities, whereby we will
transparently share open positions, and aim for diverse
candidate slates and diverse interview panels for the
recruitment of all senior leadership positions. We
enhanced our existing Inclusion & Diversity leadership
offerings, increasing instances of our Senior Women’s
Leadership Program and piloted a Women’s
Leadership program focused toward emerging
professionals. We also revitalized our existing
employee resource groups and launched an Executive
Inclusion and Diversity Committee.

the category of ‘society’ at the SponsoRing awards, and
a silver in the ‘integration award’ for identifying and
engaging influencers in the WOMMA awards.

3.2.4 Culture of Performance
We have made strong progress in increasing
performance. However to succeed as the leading
health technology company, we need to further
improve how we work and step up all aspects of
performance. Our strategy requires us to work together
to deliver compelling solutions across the health
continuum that bring true value to consumers and
customers. Our current behaviors include; winning,
taking ownership, teamwork and acting with integrity,
yet we can sharpen our focus on customers, delivering
with quality, acting fast, and being eager to improve.

Living our desired Philips culture is foundational to
succeeding in delivering on our vision, and to being the
best company in health technology for people who
share our passion.
We recognize and value inspiring and inclusive leaders,
through smart assessment, development planning,
leadership programs, and coaching and sponsoring our
talent. In 2017, 87% of Executive-level appointments
were internal. We expect to continue to see a low
percentage of external hiring at Executive level, where
we will increasingly aim to develop and promote our
talent from within, complemented with targeted
external hiring for critical competencies.
Realizing a culture of performance is grounded in
proper people management practices, high quality
feedback, transparency and acting on performance and
talent outcomes. We will increase our focus on
individuals being able to drive their own career,
supporting our employees with automation and
Artificial Intelligence. We will ensure transparency of
opportunities, and fair and open HR processes.

3.2.5 Employee engagement
High employee engagement is foundational to
achieving our Philips health technology strategy. Our
employee survey consistently reports high levels of
employee engagement above the high performing
norm of 69%, rising from 71% favorable in 2015 to 76%
in 2017.

and a moral requirement for ensuring that Human

Our General Business Principles (GBP) express our
support and respect for Human Rights. In addition, we
have employment-related policies that further
reference and protect the rights of our people. In 2017,
we developed an overarching Human Rights policy that
aligns our different Human Rights-related policies
towards a single goal: embed the responsibility to
respect Human Rights through all our businesses,
markets and functions. Philips’ Human Rights policy
ratifies Philips’ commitment not to infringe people’s
rights and to address any adverse Human Rights
impacts that we might cause. To that end, our policy
states that we intend to conduct regular Human Rights
impact assessments as part of an overall Human Rights
due diligence process, and to remediate any negative
Human Rights impacts. We are also firmly committed to
continuous improvement: we will track and publicly
report on progress (on an annual basis) as input to our
dialogues with our internal and external stakeholders
who are, or could potentially be, affected by our
actions.

3.2.8 General Business Principles

Total Recordable Cases (TRC) rate is defined as a Key
Performance Indicator (KPI), on which we set yearly
targets for the company, Business Groups and
industrial sites. For data comparability reasons, we also
provide the Lost Workday Injury Cases (LWIC) rate.
We recorded 234 TRCs in 2017, a small decrease
compared to 239 in 2016. These are cases where an
injured employee is unable to work for one or more
days, had medical treatment, or sustained an industrial
illness. We will continue to monitor this KPI and actively
set reduction targets for all our businesses in 2018.
In 2017, we recorded 113 LWICs. These are occupational
injury cases where an injured person is unable to work
for one or more days after the injury. This represents a
10% increase compared with 103 in 2016. The LWIC rate
increased to 0.17 per 100 FTEs in 2017, compared with
0.16 in 2016. The number of Lost Workdays caused by
injuries increased by 965 days (30%) to 4,170 days in
2017, mainly caused by longer recovery periods related
to a limited number of incidents.

3.3 Environmental performance
Philips has a long sustainability history stretching all the
way back to our founding fathers. In 1994, we launched
our first program and set sustainability targets for our
own operations. Next, we launched our second
program in 1998, which focused on the environmental
dimension of our operations and products. We also
started to focus on sustainability in our supply chain in
2003. We extended our scope further in 2010 by
including the social dimension of products and
solutions, which is now reflected in our company vision:
We strive to make the world healthier and more
sustainable through innovation. Our goal is to improve
the lives of 3 billion people a year by 2025.
In 2016, our CEO Frans van Houten launched our new
five-year sustainability program, ‘Healthy people,
sustainable planet’, addressing both social and
environmental challenges and including associated
targets to be achieved by 2020.
The three pillars of the ‘Healthy people, sustainable
planet’ program are:
• Creating value for our customers through
Sustainable Solutions
• Leading by example in our Sustainable Operations
• Multiplying our impact by driving Sustainability
through our supply chain
More details on the program, as well as the results in
2017, have been addressed in this report.
Every year, Royal Philips publishes a full Integrated
Annual Report. Our independent auditor Ernst & Young
(EY) has not only audited our financial information but
has also provided reasonable (highest level) assurance
on Sustainability Information in chapter 13,
Sustainability statements, of this Annual Report and
sections section 3.2, Social performance, of this Annual
Report and section 3.3, Environmental performance, of
this Annual Report. Please refer to section 13.5,
Assurance report of the independent auditor, of this
Annual Report. With this, Philips is a frontrunner in this
field.
In this Environmental performance section an overview
is given of the most important environmental
parameters of the new program. Improving people’s
lives, Health and Safety, and Supplier Sustainability are
addressed in the Social performance section. Details of
the ‘Healthy people, sustainable planet’ parameters
can be found in the chapter 13, Sustainability
statements, of this Annual Report.

Annual Report 2017

Environmental impact
Philips has been performing Life-Cycle Assessment
(LCAs) since the 1990s. These assessments provide
insight into the environmental impacts of our products
from cradle to grave, including the supply chain,
manufacturing process at Philips, use phase and
disposal phase. The insights are used to steer our
EcoDesign efforts and to grow our Green solutions
portfolio.
As a logical next step we have measured our
environmental impact on society at large via a so-called
Environmental Profit & Loss (EP&L) account which
includes the hidden environmental costs associated
with our activities and products, again from cradle to
grave. It will support our ‘Healthy people, sustainable
planet’ program by providing insights into the main
environmental hotspots from an overall business point
of view.
The EP&L account is based on LCA methodology in
which the environmental impacts are expressed in
monetary terms using conversion factors as developed
by CE Delft. We used expert opinions and estimates for
some parts of the calculations. The figures reported are
Philips’ best possible estimate. As we gain new insights
and retrieve more and better data, we may enhance the
methodology and accuracy of results in the future. For
more information we refer to our methodology report.
The current EP&L account only includes the hidden
environmental costs along the complete lifecycle of our
products and solutions. It does not yet include the
benefits to society that Philips generates by improving
people’s lives through our products and solutions, e.g.
our healthcare or healthy food preparation solutions.
We have a well-established methodology to calculate
the number of lives we positively touch with our
products and solution. It is our aim to look into valuing
these societal benefits in monetary terms as well and
include them in our future EP&L account, where
possible.
Results 2017
In 2017, Philips had an environmental impact (loss) of
EUR 7.2 billion of which EUR 200 million (3%) is directly
caused by Philips’ own operations, mainly driven by
energy consumption at our factories. The main
environmental impact, 86% of total, is related to the
usage of our products which is due to electricity
consumption. Particulate matter formation and climate
change are the main environmental impacts accounting
for respectively 43% and 28% of the total impact.

The environmental loss includes the environmental
impact of the full life-time of our products that we put
on the market in 2017, e.g. an average 7 years of usage
in case of a vacuum cleaner or 10 years on average in
case of a MRI system.
The environmental loss has been positively influenced
over the years by our efforts to increase the energy
efficiency of our products. This will be enhanced by
society’s transition to a renewable energy system. We
also expect a shift in our environmental impact from the
use phase to our supply chain, i.e. the materials we use
in our products. Our supply chain currently has an
environmental impact of some EUR 800 million, which
is 11% of our total environmental impact. The main
contributors are the electronic components, cables and
steel used in our products. Through our Circular
Economy and Supplier Sustainability programs we will
continue to focus on reducing the environmental
impact caused by the materials we source and apply in
our products.

Green Innovation in 2017 amounted to EUR 99 million,
a decrease compared to 2016, as a number of large
innovation projects had been completed in 2016. All
Philips Green Focal Areas are taken into account as we

aim to reduce environmental impact over the total
lifecycle. Energy efficiency is an area of focus,
especially for our large imaging systems such as MRI.
Philips also pays particular attention to enabling the
upgrading of pathways, so our customers can benefit
from the most advanced enhancements in workflow,
dose management, and imaging quality with the
equipment that they already own which enables
reduced materials use and lower cost. Our Diagnosis &
Treatment businesses actively support a voluntary
industry initiative to improve the energy efficiency of
medical imaging equipment. Moreover, we are actively
partnering with multiple leading care providers to look
together for innovative ways to reduce the
environmental impact of healthcare, for example by
maximizing energy-efficient use of medical equipment
and optimizing lifecycle value.
Connected Care & Health Informatics businesses
Philips innovates with connected health IT solutions
that integrate, collect, combine and deliver quality data
for actionable insights to help improve access to quality
care, while respecting the boundaries of natural
resources. It is our belief that well-designed e-health
solutions can reduce the travel-related carbon
footprint of healthcare, and improve access to care and
outcomes. Investments in Green Innovation in 2017
amounted to EUR 33 million, in line with previous years.
All Philips Green Focal Areas are taken into account as
we aim to reduce environmental impact over the total
lifecycle. Energy efficiency and material reduction are
the main areas of focus.
Personal Health businesses
Continuous high R&D investments at our Personal
Health businesses are also reflected in Green
Innovation spend, which amounted to EUR 91 million in
2017, compared with EUR 96 million in 2016. The
investments resulted in high Green Revenues in all
business groups. The Personal Health businesses
continued their work on improving the energy efficiency
of their products, closing the materials loop (e.g. by
using recycled materials in products and packaging)
and the voluntary phase-out of polyvinyl chloride
(PVC), brominated flame retardants (BFR), Bisphenol A
(BPA) and phthalates from, among others, food contact
products. A breakthrough has been achieved with the
implementation of PVC-free internal wiring in our
SENSEO® portfolio and the application of recycled
plastics in our air purification and coffee portfolio.
Regarding the phase-out of PVC/BFR, close to 100% of
the oral healthcare, mother and child care, male
grooming, skincare and female depilation products are
PVC/BFR-free. Our new green battery-charged devices
outperform the most stringent energy efficiency
standard in the world (USA Federal).

HealthTech Other
HealthTech Other invested EUR 10 million in Green
Innovations, spread over projects focused on global
challenges related to water, air, energy, food, Circular
Economy, and access to affordable healthcare. The
Research organization within HealthTech Other used
the Sustainable Innovation Assessment tool, in which
innovation projects are evaluated and scored along
environmental and social dimensions, in order to
identify those projects that most strongly drive
sustainability. Transfers of Research projects include a
Lives Improved calculation to assess what the project’s
contribution will be to Philips’ vision to improve the lives
of 3 billion people a year by 2025. In a Philips
Research demonstration project, for example, a new
and innovative ‘Philips Unified Monitoring Architecture’
was developed containing standardized components
for next-generation patient monitoring, which helps
streamline workflows and improve monitoring across
the health continuum. Sustainability impact
assessment has shown significant improvements in
both environmental and social areas. This could be
realized by smart concepts for smaller low-power and
light-weight modules, and increased battery lifetimes.
Herewith a sustainability improvement of over 30% has
been demonstrated, while avoiding restricted
materials.
Circular Economy
The transition from a linear to a circular economy is
essential if we are to create a sustainable world. A
circular economy aims to decouple economic growth
from the use of natural resources and ecosystems by
using these resources more effectively. It is a driver of
innovation in the areas of material, component and
product re-use, as well as new business models such
as system solutions and services. In a circular economy,
more effective (re)use of materials enables the creation
of more value, both by means of cost savings and by
developing new markets or growing existing ones. The
‘Healthy people, sustainable planet’ program includes
a target to generate 15% of our revenues in 2020 from
circular products and solutions.
For more information on our Circular Economy
activities and the progress towards targets in 2017,
please refer to sub-section 13.4.1, Circular Economy, of
this Annual Report.

3.3.2 Green Revenues
Green Revenues are generated through products and
solutions which offer a significant environmental
improvement in one or more Green Focal Areas: Energy
efficiency, Packaging, Hazardous substances, Weight,
Circularity, and Lifetime reliability. Green Revenues
increased to EUR 10.7 billion in 2017, or 60.2% of sales
(58.5% in 2016), thereby reaching a record level for
Philips.

Through our EcoDesign process we aim to create
products and solutions that have significantly less
impact on the environment during their whole lifecycle.
Overall, the most significant improvements have been
realized in our energy efficiency Green Focal Area, an
important objective of our program, although there was
also growing attention for hazardous substances and
recyclability in all segments in 2017, the latter driven by
our Circular Economy initiatives.
Diagnosis & Treatment businesses
In 2017, our Diagnosis & Treatment businesses
maintained their Green Product and Solutions portfolio
with redesigns of various Green Products with further
environmental improvements. These products improve
patient outcomes, provide better value, and help
secure access to high-quality care, while reducing
environmental impact. We received third-party
confirmation in 2017 that the Philips portfolio of 1.5T
MRI scanners leads the industry in terms of their energy
efficiency according to the COCIR SRI methodology.
Connected Care & Health Informatics businesses
Our Connected Care & Health Informatics businesses
maintained its Green Product and Solutions portfolio in
2017.
Personal Health businesses
Our Personal Health businesses focus on Green
Products and Solutions which meet or exceed our
minimum requirements in the areas of energy
consumption, packaging, and substances of concern.
Green Revenues in 2017 surpassed 58% of total sales,
compared to 56% in 2016. All our new consumer Green
Products with rechargeable batteries (like
toothbrushes, shavers, and grooming products)
outperform the world’s most stringent energy efficiency
norm set by the US Federal government. We are making
steady progress in developing PVC/BFR-free products.
More than 70% of our consumer product sales consist
of PVC/BFR-free products, with the exception of the
power cords, for which there are not yet economically
viable alternatives available. In the remaining 30% of

Philips’ Sustainable Operations programs focus on the
main contributors to climate change, recycling of waste,
reduction of water consumption, and reduction of
emissions. Full details can be found in chapter 13,
Sustainability statements, of this Annual Report.
Carbon footprint and energy efficiency
Philips has committed to the ambition of becoming
100% carbon-neutral in our operations and sourcing all
our electricity usage from 100% renewable sources by
2020.
As of 2008, Philips reports its climate performance to
CDP (formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project),
a global NGO that assesses the greenhouse gas (GHG)
emission performance and management of reporting
companies. For the fifth year in a row we received the
Climate Leadership (A) score in 2017. In order to deliver
on the carbon neutrality commitment we have set
ambitious reduction targets.
In 2017, our greenhouse gas emissions resulted in 847
kilotonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalent (CO2e), but
because of our carbon neutrality program, some of our
emissions have been compensated for via carbon
offsets, resulting in a total of 627 kilotonnes carbon
dioxide-equivalent (CO2e).
Philips reports all its emissions in line with the
Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHGP) as further described
in chapter 13, Sustainability statements, of this Annual
Report.

still excludes the acquired carbon offsets. As part of our

Annual Report 2017

29

Group performance 3.3.3

‘Healthy people, sustainable planet’ program we are
continuing our efforts to decouple economic growth
from our environmental impact.
The significant reductions in our scope 2 (indirect)
emissions are mainly driven by our increased global
renewable electricity share from 62% in 2016 to 79% in
2017.
We achieved a major milestone as 100% of our US
operations are now powered by renewable electricity
from the Los Mirasoles windfarm. In addition, our
renewable electricity purchasing consortium with
AkzoNobel, DSM and Google closed the second wind
energy transaction in the Netherlands in 2017 - the
Bouwdokken windfarm in the province of Zeeland. We
expect the first Dutch wind energy to be delivered in
2018 and the two Dutch windfarms will power all our
operations in the Netherlands by 2019.
Combined with the achieved energy reductions this led
to a 53% carbon reduction from our electricity
consumption (scope 2) in 2017 compared to 2016.
Our business travel emissions showed a reduction of
15% compared to 2016, driven by an air travel limitation
introduced in 2017, which led to an air travel emission
reduction of 9%. The emissions resulting from our lease
cars decreased by 23% and the emissions from rental
cars went down by 5%. In order to further decrease our
business travel emissions we will continue to promote
video conferencing as an alternative to travel, promote
alternative modes of transport and set new fuel
efficiency targets in our lease car policy.
As our sales grew, we recorded an increase of 23% in
our logistics operations compared to 2016. This mainly
resulted from a strong increase in air freight shipments
to meet demand. We plan to introduce various
measures to drive down air freight shipments by
introducing a stricter air freight policy and by optimizing
our warehouse locations.
In 2017 we kicked off our carbon neutrality program by
compensating 220 kilotonnes of carbon emissions,
equivalent to the annual uptake of approximately 6
million medium-sized oak trees. This covers the total
emissions of our direct emissions in our sites, all our
business travel emissions and part of our logistics
emissions. We do so by financing carbon reduction
projects in emerging regions that have a strong link with
SDG 3 and SDG 12.
We are investing in several carbon emission reduction
projects to gradually drive down our emissions to zero
by 2020. We have selected projects in emerging regions
that, in addition to generating emission reductions, also
drive social, economic and additional environmental
progress for the communities in which they operate,
such as:

Annual Report 2017

Providing access to safe drinking water while reducing
wood consumption
These carbon emission reduction projects will provide
millions of liters of safe drinking water in Uganda and
Ethiopia and will reduce the mortality risk from waterborne diseases. Additionally, less wood will be required
for boiling water, leading to less indoor air pollution and
slowing down the deforestation rate.
Fighting against respiratory diseases and
deforestation by clean cookstoves
By financing high-efficient cookstoves in Kenya and
Uganda, less wood will be required for cooking, leading
to lower carbon emissions, a reduction in diseases
caused by indoor air pollution and a lower
deforestation rate in these regions.
Providing access to clean energy while improving
health and education
This project will reduce the demand-supply gap in the
Dewas region in India and will provide renewable
energy to more than 50,000 households. The project
will also provide a mobile medical unit in 24 villages,
giving diagnosis and medicines free of charge twice a
month. Additional funding will be provided to
educational programs and improving sanitation
facilities in five local schools to maximize the social
impact.

Total waste consists of waste that is delivered for
landfill, incineration or recycling. Our sites are
addressing both the recycling percentage as well as
waste sent to landfill as part of the new sustainability
program. Materials delivered for recycling via an
external contractor amounted to 20 kilotonnes, which
equals 80% of total waste, comparable to 2016. Of the
20% remaining waste, 83% comprised non-hazardous
waste and 17% hazardous waste. Our Zero Waste to
Landfill KPI excludes one-time-only waste and waste
delivered to landfill due to regulatory requirements.
According to this definition, in 2017 we reported 2.5
kilotonnes of waste sent to landfill. 17 out of our 38
industrials sites achieved Zero Waste to Landfill status.

Emissions
In the ‘Healthy people, sustainable planet’ program,
Royal Philips included new reduction targets for the
substances that are most relevant for its businesses. In
order to provide comparable information at Group
level, please find the summary of the emissions of the
formerly targeted substances below. Emissions of
restricted substances were reduced from 1 kilos in 2016
to zero in 2017, mainly caused by one site in China
which phased out a thinner containing benzene. The
level of emissions of hazardous substances decreased
from 10,496 kilos in 2016 to 5,243 kilos in 2017 (-50%),
mainly driven by changes in the lacquering process and
product mix in the Personal Health businesses.

3.4 Our commitment to Quality
We continue to drive quality and regulatory
performance improvement throughout the Philips
Group. Under our governance model, the Executive
Committee is ultimately accountable for Quality at
Philips, supported by the Quality & Regulatory team.
The Quality & Regulatory team drives to one common

Annual Report 2017

set of standards through the Philips Quality
Management System (PQMS), as well as providing
transparency on performance and opportunities for
further improvement. Inclusion of quality metrics in
monthly business reviews has driven transparency and
improvement execution.
Our year-over-year performance continues to show
improvement. On key end-to-end transformation
initiatives, we progressed significantly in 2017, including
making headway with the implementation of PQMS for
all business groups.
However, 2017 was also an eventful year from a
regulatory compliance perspective:
• In August 2017, the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) conducted an inspection of Philips’ Computed
Tomography/Advanced Molecular Imaging (CT/AMI)
facility in Cleveland, Illinois. This was the first FDA
inspection of the site since the temporary, voluntary
suspension of manufacturing and shipping of CT/AMI
products from Cleveland in 2014. Following the
inspection, Philips submitted its response to the
inspectional observations for review by the FDA. In
December 2017, the company had a constructive
meeting with the FDA. Philips will provide monthly
status reports to the FDA on its progress in addressing
the observations.
• In October 2017, Philips entered into a consent
decree with the US Department of Justice,
representing the FDA, related to compliance with
current good manufacturing practice requirements
arising from past inspections in and before 2015,
focusing primarily on Philips’ Emergency Care &
Resuscitation (ECR) business operations in Andover
(Massachusetts, US) and Bothell (Washington, US).
The decree also provides for increased scrutiny, for a
period of time, of the compliance of the other patient
care businesses at these facilities with the Quality
System Regulation.
Under the decree, Philips has suspended the
manufacturing and distribution of external
defibrillators manufactured at these facilities, subject
to certain exceptions, until FDA certifies through
inspection the facilities’ compliance with the Quality
System Regulation. The decree allows Philips to
continue the manufacture and distribution of certain
automated external defibrillator (AED) models and
Philips will continue to service ECR devices and
provide consumables and the relevant accessories.
We are fully engaged with FDA staff concerning both
matters and anticipate follow-up inspections of these
facilities by FDA in 2018 after further compliance
improvements have been made.
Currently we are also focusing on the European Union
Medical Devices Regulation (EU MDR) compliance for
future market access, and early identification and
collaboration in the changing regulatory environment.

32

Annual Report 2017

Looking ahead we will continue to raise the
performance bar, also including Quality in the
evaluation of all senior management. With consistency
of purpose, top-down accountability, standardization,
and leveraging continuous improvement we aim to
drive greater speed in the adoption of a Quality mindset
throughout the enterprise.

3.5 Proposed distribution to
shareholders
Pursuant to article 34 of the articles of association of
Royal Philips, a dividend will first be declared on
preference shares out of net income. The remainder of
the net income, after any retention by way of reserve
with the approval of the Supervisory Board, shall be
available for distribution to holders of common shares
subject to shareholder approval after year-end. As of
December 31, 2017, the issued share capital consists
only of common shares; no preference shares have
been issued. Article 33 of the articles of association of
Royal Philips gives the Board of Management the
power to determine what portion of the net income
shall be retained by way of reserve, subject to the
approval of the Supervisory Board.
A proposal will be submitted to the upcoming Annual
General Meeting of Shareholders to declare a dividend
of EUR 0.80 per common share (up to EUR 750 million
if all shareholders would elect cash), in cash or in shares
at the option of the shareholder, against the net income
for 2017.
If the above dividend proposal is adopted, the shares
will be traded ex-dividend as of May 7, 2018 at the New
York Stock Exchange and Euronext Amsterdam. In
compliance with the listing requirements of the New
York Stock Exchange and the stock market of Euronext
Amsterdam, the dividend record date will be May 8,
2018.
Shareholders will be given the opportunity to make
their choice between cash and shares between May 9,
2018 and June 1, 2018. If no choice is made during this
election period the dividend will be paid in cash. On
June 1, 2018 after close of trading, the number of share
dividend rights entitled to one new common share will
be determined based on the volume weighted average
price of all traded common shares Koninklijke Philips
N.V. at Euronext Amsterdam on May 30 and 31, and
June 1, 2018. The Company will calculate the number of
share dividend rights entitled to one new common
share (the ‘ratio’), such that the gross dividend in shares
will be approximately equal to the gross dividend in
cash. The ratio and the number of shares to be issued
will be announced on June 5, 2018. Payment of the
dividend and delivery of new common shares, with
settlement of fractions in cash, if required, will take
place from June 6, 2018. The distribution of dividend in
cash to holders of New York Registry shares will be
made in USD at the USD/EUR rate as per WM/ Reuters
FX Benchmark 2 PM CET fixing of June 4, 2018.

Group performance 3.5

Further details will be given in the agenda for the 2018
Annual General Meeting of Shareholders. All dates
mentioned remain provisional until then.
Dividend in cash is in principle subject to 15% Dutch
dividend withholding tax, which will be deducted from
the dividend in cash paid to the shareholders. Dividend
in shares paid out of net income and retained earnings
is subject to 15% dividend withholding tax, but only in
respect of the par value of the shares (EUR 0.20 per
share).
In 2017, a dividend of EUR 0.80 per common share was
paid in cash or shares, at the option of the shareholder.
For 48.3% of the shares, the shareholders elected for a
share dividend resulting in the issue of 11,264,163 new
common shares, leading to a 1.2% dilution. EUR 384
million was paid in cash. See also chapter 15, Investor
Relations, of this Annual Report.
The balance sheet presented in this report, as part of
the Company financial statements for the period ended
December 31, 2017, is before appropriation of the result
for the financial year 2017.

4 Segment performance
Our structure in 2017
Koninklijke Philips N.V. (‘Royal Philips’ or the
‘Company’) is the parent company of the Philips Group
(‘Philips’ or the ‘Group’), headquartered in Amsterdam,
the Netherlands. The Company is managed by the
members of the Executive Committee (comprising the
Board of Management and certain key officers) under
the supervision of the Supervisory Board. The Executive
Committee operates under the chairmanship of the
Chief Executive Officer and shares responsibility for the
deployment of Philips’ strategy and policies, and the
achievement of its objectives and results.
In September 2014, Philips announced its plan to
sharpen its strategic focus by establishing two standalone companies focused on the HealthTech and
Lighting opportunities respectively. To this end, a
stand-alone structure was established for Philips
Lighting within the Philips Group, effective February 1,
2016. Then, on May 27, 2016, Philips Lighting was listed

and started trading on Euronext in Amsterdam under
the symbol ‘LIGHT’. Following the listing of Philips
Lighting, Philips retained a 71.225% stake. In the course
of 2017, Philips gradually reduced its stake in Philips
Lighting’s issued share capital to approximately
29.01%, in line with its stated objective to fully sell down
its stake in Philips Lighting within one year.
Following the latter accelerated bookbuild offering on
November 28, 2017, Philips no longer has control over
Philips Lighting and ceased to consolidate Philips
Lighting as from the end of November 2017.
The reportable segments are Personal Health

OneBlade hybrid styler, which can trim, edge and shave
any length of male facial hair, generated annual sales
of more than EUR 100 million within 18 months of its
launch.

In China, Philips partnered with Oranger, a service
provider specialized in chronic respiratory disease
management, and Health 100, the largest health
examination organization in China, to provide
integrated solutions for chronic respiratory diseases
that cover screening, referral, treatment and recovery.
As part of the agreement, Philips acquired a minority
interest in Oranger.
Building on its strategy to deliver relevant solutions and
business models, Philips acquired Australian Pharmacy
Sleep Services (APSS), a pioneer in pharmacy sleep
testing. APSS will complement Philips’ sleep and
respiratory care portfolio and will help to accelerate the
business’s home sleep testing offering through the
pharmacy channel in Australia.

4.1.4 Healthy people, sustainable planet
Sustainability continued to play an important role in the
Personal Health businesses in 2017, with the main focus
on optimizing the sustainability performance of our
products and operations. Green Revenues – i.e. sales
of products and solutions which meet or exceed our
minimum requirements in the area of energy
consumption, packaging and/or substances of concern
– accounted for 58% of total sales in 2017. All Green
Products with rechargeable batteries exceed the
stringent California energy efficiency standard by at
least 10%. And over 70% of total consumer sales are
PVC- and/or BFR-free products (excluding power
cords).
As part of our Circular Economy program we have
continued to increase the use of recycled materials in
our products. Over 1,850 tons of recycled plastics were
used in kitchen appliances, vacuum cleaners, irons, air
purification and coffee machines, compared to 1,440
tons in 2016. The revenue from Circular Products
reached over EUR 473 million in 2017, comprised of
turnover generated from performance- and accessbased business models in Sleep & Respiratory Care and
products with recycled plastic materials. Furthermore,
circular opportunities across multiple products have
been explored through pilots with access-based
business models, which have the potential to generate
future circular revenues. To maximize the use of
resources and capture value from our commercial
returns, pilots are running to sell refurbished products
to our consumers – at the same time, capabilities are
also being developed to enable the scale-up of these
pilots.
As a concrete example of our commitment to
sustainability we have improved the design of the 2000
Series Air Cleaner to ensure it meets the green product
requirements. This means that the device meets the
Chinese requirements for high cleaning energy
efficiency, is free of polyvinylchloride (except power
cord) and has over 600 grams of recycled plastics in the
interior parts of the product.
In our operations, we continue to make positive
progress towards our ultimate aim of having carbonneutral production sites by 2020. In 2017, 47% of the
electricity used in manufacturing sites came from
renewable sources and 85% of the industrial waste was
recycled. We sent 6% of our manufacturing waste to
landfill in 2017. At the end of 2017, 9 out of 18 Personal
Health businesses’ manufacturing sites reported zero
waste to landfill, with five achieving this status during
the year. Based on detailed action plans we are working
closely with the remaining sites to achieve zero waste
to landfill status by the end of 2020.

4.2 Diagnosis & Treatment businesses
The Chief Business Leader of the Diagnosis &
Treatment businesses segment, Rob Cascella, joined
Philips in April 2015. He has more than 30 years of
experience in the healthcare industry and has served
on the boards of several companies, including 10 years
as President and later CEO of Hologic Inc.

4.2.1 About Diagnosis & Treatment businesses
Our Diagnosis & Treatment businesses are foundational
to our health technology strategy, delivering on the
promise of precision medicine and least-invasive
treatment and therapy. We enable our customers to
realize the full potential of their ‘quadruple aim’ – to
improve outcomes, lower the cost of care delivery and
enhance patient and staff experiences – by enabling
first-time-right diagnosis and treatment. We are
focused on solutions (consisting of suites of systems,
smart devices, software and services) that are robust
and easy to use, while providing the most efficient path
to obtaining a definitive diagnosis by integrating
multiple sources of information and combining the data
to create a comprehensive patient view. By bringing
together imaging morphology, pathology and
genomics, we are able to interrogate and extract the
information needed to offer highly personalized care.
Informatics is central to everything we do: our KLASawarded IntelliSpace Portal platform, for example,
provides artificial intelligence to make more consistent
decisions, as well as making it easier to share and
collaborate.
We are expanding the applications for image-guided
treatment and therapy – where clinicians are provided
with the technology necessary to determine the
presence of disease, guide procedures, deliver leastinvasive treatment, and confirm effectiveness. Our
solutions enable patient-specific treatment planning
and selection, simplify complex procedures through
integrated real-time guidance, and provide clinically
proven treatment solutions. In 2017, we reinforced our
leadership in image-guided therapy solutions with the
global launch of Philips Azurion, the next-generation
image-guided therapy platform that enables clinicians
to perform a wide range of routine and complex
procedures, helping them to optimize interventional lab
performance and provide superior care. We provide
image guidance both in our proprietary products and
by partnering with radiation therapy companies like
Elekta and IBA to deliver real-time, precise cancer
treatment.
In 2017, Philips made two significant acquisitions to
further strengthen our Diagnosis & Treatment
businesses. Spectranetics’ portfolio – including laser
atherectomy catheters, the AngioSculptX drug-coated
scoring balloon and the Stellarex drug-coated balloon
– is highly complementary to Philips’ and will support
our expansion in image-guided therapy devices –
specifically addressing peripheral vascular disease.
Furthermore, to reinforce our leadership position in

38

Annual Report 2017

ultrasound, Philips acquired TomTec Imaging Systems,
a leading provider of clinical applications and
intelligent image-analysis software.
In addition to our solutions for disease-specific clinical
pathways, we provide a range of technologies to help
our customers improve their operations and workflow.
In 2017 we continued to build out our comprehensive
PerformanceBridge suite of software services designed
to improve radiology department operations, e.g. by
providing practice management, dose management
and service analytics. And we received FDA clearance
for IntelliSpace Portal 9.0 and a range of innovative
applications for radiology. The platform gives clinicians
a comprehensive view of each patient, enabling
efficient diagnosis of a broad range of conditions.
Our Diagnosis & Treatment businesses’ value
proposition to customers is based on leveraging our
extensive clinical experience with our broad portfolio of
technologies – making us uniquely capable to provide
meaningful solutions that ultimately can improve the
lives of the patients we serve while lowering the cost of
care delivery for our customers.
Through our various businesses, Diagnosis & Treatment
is focused on growing market share and profitability by:
• driving operational excellence in Diagnostic Imaging
by delivering integrated products that are robust in
design, easy to use, and promote efficient workflow
• enhancing our offerings in oncology, cardiology and
radiology and expanding our solutions offering,
which comprises systems, smart devices, software
and services
• leveraging the Volcano and Spectranetics
acquisitions and driving expansion into devices for
treatment
• addressing underpenetrated adjacencies in general
imaging and obstetrics/gynecology in Ultrasound, as
well as expanding in point-of-care with new
products and our partnership with B.Braun to
innovate and accelerate growth in ultrasoundguided regional anesthesia and vascular access.
Philips is one of the world’s leading health technology
companies (based on sales) along with Medtronic,
General Electric and Siemens. The competitive
landscape in the healthcare industry is evolving with
the emergence of new market players. The United
States, our largest market, represented 34% of
Diagnosis & Treatment’s global sales in 2017, followed
by China, Japan and Germany. Growth geographies
accounted for 34% of Diagnosis & Treatment’s sales. In
2017, Diagnosis & Treatment had 25,757 employees
worldwide.
Through 2017 we consistently focused on our valuecreation strategy to ensure continued growth and
margin improvement.

Segment performance 4.2.1

Sales at Philips’ Diagnosis & Treatment businesses are
generally higher in the second half of the year, largely
due to the timing of new product availability and
customer spending patterns.
Sales channels are a mix of a direct sales force,
especially in all the larger markets, combined with
online sales portal and distributors – this varies by
product, market and price segment. Sales are mostly
driven by a direct sales force that has an intimate
knowledge of the procedures for which our devices are
used, and visits our customer base frequently.
Philips’ Diagnosis & Treatment businesses are
committed to compliance with regulatory product
approval and quality system requirements in every
market we serve, by addressing specific requirements
of local and national regulatory authorities including
the US FDA, the CFDA in China and comparable
agencies in other countries, as well as the European
Union’s Waste from Electrical and Electronic
Equipment (WEEE), Restriction of Hazardous

Substances (RoHS) and Registration, Evaluation,
Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH)
regulations.
The imaging businesses and image processing
applications are governed by regulatory approvals in
the markets that we serve. In almost all cases, new
products that we introduce are subject to a regulatory
approval process (e.g. 510k for FDA approvals in the
USA). Failing to comply with the regulatory
requirements can have severe consequences. The
number and diversity of regulatory bodies in the various
markets we operate in globally adds complexity and
time to product introductions. Regulatory approval is a
prerequisite for market introduction of medical devices.

4.2.2 2017 business highlights
Philips reinforced its leadership in image-guided
therapy solutions with the global launch of Philips
Azurion, the next-generation image-guided therapy
platform that enables clinicians to perform a wide range
of routine and complex procedures, helping them to
optimize interventional lab performance and provide
superior care.
To further strengthen its Diagnosis & Treatment
businesses, Philips acquired Spectranetics. Its highly
complementary portfolio, including laser atherectomy
catheters, the AngioSculptX drug-coated scoring
balloon and the Stellarex drug-coated balloon, will
support Philips’ expansion in image-guided therapy
devices. Furthermore, to reinforce its leadership
position in ultrasound, Philips acquired TomTec
Imaging Systems, a leading provider of clinical
applications and intelligent image-analysis software.
Philips Volcano continued its strong performance as
the business reached an important milestone with the
results of two large clinical trials demonstrating the
benefits of Philips’ Instant Wave-Free Ratio (iFR)
technology compared to Fractional Flow Reserve
(FFR), the current standard, removing a critical barrier
for the use and adoption of iFR to decide, guide and
confirm appropriate therapies.
B. Braun and Philips entered into a strategic alliance to
innovate and accelerate growth in ultrasound-guided
regional anesthesia and vascular access. The alliance
launched Xperius, a new co-branded mobile
ultrasound system specifically designed as the platform
to support current and future integrated solutions in this
fast-growing market.

Further strengthening its portfolio of imaging solutions,
Philips received FDA 510(k) clearance for its ElastQ
ultrasound imaging technology for non-invasive
assessment of liver conditions. Philips also launched
Access CT, a new CT system designed for healthcare
organizations seeking to establish or enhance CT
imaging capabilities at affordable cost.
Building on its portfolio of long-term strategic
partnerships, Philips signed multiple new agreements.
For example, Philips has partnered with the Singapore
Institute of Advanced Medicine Holdings to provide its
new oncology center with a range of Philips’ advanced
diagnostic imaging systems, combined with clinical
informatics and services for a multi-year term.
Philips continued its strong growth momentum in
China, driven by its innovative consumer health and
professional healthcare portfolio, focused initiatives to
step up market share and customer partnerships. This
is illustrated by the double-digit growth in Diagnostic
Imaging order intake1), which was in part driven by the
strong traction in the private hospital segment, such as
the new strategic partnership with Health 100, the
largest health examination organization in China.
Driving its expansion in the fast-growing Obstetrics and
Gynecology segment, Philips introduced new OB/GYN
ultrasound innovations that are designed to support
earlier, easier and more confident diagnoses.
Highlighted features include anatomical-intelligence
clinical decision support and workflow enhancements
such as fingertip control and enhanced imaging
versatility.
As part of Philips’ new introductions to drive growth in
diagnostic imaging, the company launched its digital
MR Prodiva 1.5T system, which provides enhanced
clinical performance and increased productivity, and

4.2.4 Healthy people, sustainable planet
Sustainability continued to play an important role in the
Diagnosis & Treatment businesses in 2017. Philips
continues to improve lives around the globe by
developing diagnosis and treatment solutions that
enable first-time-right diagnosis, precision
interventions and therapy, while respecting the
boundaries of natural resources.
In 2017, Green Revenues in Diagnosis & Treatment
amounted to EUR 5,096 million, thanks to a large
portfolio of Philips Green Products and Solutions that
support energy efficiency, materials reduction and
other sustainability goals. Philips actively collaborates
with care providers around the globe to look for ways
to minimize the environmental impact of healthcare. In
a project together with Rijnstate Hospital in Arnhem
(Netherlands), Philips has calculated that this hospital
is saving about 64,000 kWh of electricity annually
simply by powering-off imaging systems after hours.
Philips has received third-party confirmation from
COCIR that we are the frontrunner in MRI energy
efficiency according to the COCIR SRI methodology and
that our performance is 30% better than the industry
average.
Supporting the transition to a circular economy, we
have continued to expand the Diamond Select
refurbishment program, spare parts recovery and
SmartPath upgrading program for all modalities in the
Diagnosis & Treatment portfolio. Philips is committed to
‘closing the loop’ on all large medical imaging
equipment that becomes available to us. This means
that we will actively pursue the trade-in of equipment
such as MRI, CT and cardiovascular systems and we will
take full control to ensure that all traded-in materials
are repurposed in a responsible way. We plan to
continue to expand these practices until we have
covered all professional healthcare equipment.
Also in our operations we continue to make positive
progress towards a circular economy by recycling 71%
of our industrial waste. At the end of 2017, 5 out of 15
Diagnosis & Treatment businesses’ manufacturing sites
reported zero waste to landfill. Based on detailed action
plans we are working closely with the remaining sites to
achieve zero waste to landfill status by the end of 2020.

4.3 Connected Care & Health Informatics businesses
Dr. Carla Kriwet is Chief Business Leader of the
Connected Care & Health Informatics businesses
segment. She was appointed to this role in February
2017, succeeding Jeroen Tas. Prior to assuming her
current role, Carla led Philips’ Patient Care & Monitoring
Solutions business group and was the Philips Market
Leader of Germany, Austria & Switzerland. Before this,
she held leadership positions with ABB Daimler Benz,
The Boston Consulting Group, Linde AG and

4.3.1 About Connected Care & Health Informatics
businesses
Spanning the entire health continuum, the Connected
Care & Health Informatics businesses aim to improve
patient outcomes, increase efficiency and drive toward
value-based care. Our solutions build on Philips’
strength in patient monitoring and clinical informatics
to improve clinical and economic outcomes in all care
settings, within and outside the hospital.
Philips has a deep understanding of clinical care and
the patient experience that, when coupled with our
consultative approach, allows us to be an effective
partner for transformation, both across the enterprise
and at the level of the individual clinician. Philips
delivers services that take the burden off hospital staff
with a smooth integration process, improved workflow,
customized training and improved accessibility across
our application landscape.
This requires a common digital platform that connects
and aligns consumers, patients, payers and healthcare
providers. Philips’ platforms aggregate and leverage
information from clinical, personal and historical data
to support care providers in delivering first-time-right
diagnoses and treatment. Philips continually builds out
new capabilities within Philips HealthSuite – a cloudbased connected health ecosystem of devices, apps
and digital tools – to accomplish just that.
Philips delivers personalized insights by applying
predictive analytics and artificial intelligence across our
solutions. As an example, we are able to support
healthcare professionals caring for elderly patients
living independently at home in making clinical
decisions and alerting medical teams to potential
problems. Our integrated and data-driven approach
promotes seamless patient care, helps identify risks
and needs of different groups within a population, and
provides clinical decision support.
In 2017, the Connected Care & Health Informatics
segment consisted of the following areas of business:
• Patient Care & Monitoring Solutions: Enterprisewide patient monitoring solutions, from value
solutions to sophisticated solutions, for real-time
clinical information at the patient’s bedside; patient
analytics, patient monitoring and clinical decision

42

Annual Report 2017

support systems, including diagnostic ECG data
management for improved quality of cardiac care;
therapeutic care, including cardiac resuscitation,
emergency care solutions, invasive and non-invasive
ventilators for acute and sub-acute hospital
environments and respiratory monitoring devices;
consumables across the patient monitoring and
therapeutic care businesses; customer service,
including clinical, IT, technical and remote customer
propositions.
Effective 2018, Patient Care & Monitoring Solutions
will transition into two focused business groups –
Monitoring & Analytics and Therapeutic Care – to
allow us to better fulfill the specific customer needs
of each business.
• Healthcare Informatics: Advanced healthcare IT,
clinical and advanced visualization and
quantification informatics solutions for radiology,
cardiology and oncology departments; Universal
Data Management solutions, Picture Archiving and
Communication Systems (PACS) and fully integrated
Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems to support
healthcare enterprises in optimizing health system
performance; advanced clinical and hospital IT
platforms which are leveraged across Philips. Our
IntelliSpace Portal application platform is recognized
as industry-leading by KLAS. Today, with the role of
the hospital CIO as a key decision maker increasing,
integrated informatics solutions address challenges
across the enterprise. We use artificial intelligence at
the point of care to optimize the clinician experience,
help improve productivity and total cost of
ownership, and streamline patient experiences
across the clinical pathway. Proof of clinical and
economic outcomes, connectivity and cybersecurity
are key priorities of our engagement with our
customers.
• Population Health Management: Our services and
solutions leverage data, analytics and actionable
workflow products for solutions to improve clinical
and financial results and increase patient
engagement, satisfaction and compliance. These
solutions include: technology-enabled monitoring
and intervention (telehealth, remote patient
monitoring, personal emergency response systems
and care coordination) to improve the experience of
elderly people and those living with chronic
conditions; actionable programs to predict risk
(including medication and care compliance,
outreach, and fall prediction); cloud-based solutions
for health organizations to manage population
health. Leveraging the 2016 acquisition of
Wellcentive, a leading US-based provider of
population health management software solutions,
our solutions enable health systems to analyze their
patient population along clinical and financial
criteria, coordinate care outside the hospital, and

Segment performance 4.3.1

engage patients in their health. They help drive
quality improvement and business transformation for
those transitioning to value-based care.

In 2017, Connected Care & Health Informatics had
10,949 employees worldwide.
Sales at Philips’ Connected Care & Health Informatics
businesses are generally higher in the second half of
the year, largely due to customer spending patterns.
Sales channels include a mix of a direct salesforce
(especially in larger markets), paired with an online
sales portal and distributors (varying by product,
market and price segment). Sales are mostly driven by
a direct salesforce with an intimate knowledge of the
procedures that use our integrated solutions’ smart
devices, systems, software and services. Philips works
with customers and partners to co-create solutions,
drive commercial innovation and adapt to new models
like monitoring-as-a-service, outcome-based models
(pay based on clinical and economical outcomes) and
provider market models allowing providers to provide
prices for episodes of care.
Philips’ Connected Care & Health Informatics
businesses are committed to compliance with
regulatory product approval and quality system
requirements in every market we serve, by addressing
specific requirements of local and national regulatory
authorities including the US FDA, the CFDA in China and
comparable agencies in other countries, as well as the
European Union’s Waste from Electrical and Electronic
Equipment (WEEE), Restriction of Hazardous
Substances (RoHS) and Registration, Evaluation,
Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH)
regulations.
The connected care and health informatics applications
are governed by regulatory approvals in the markets
that we serve. In almost all cases, new products that we
introduce are subject to a regulatory approval process
(e.g. 510k for FDA approvals in USA, CE Mark in the
European Union). Failing to comply with the regulatory
requirements of the target markets can prevent
shipment of products. The number and diversity of
regulatory bodies in the various markets we operate in
globally adds complexity and time to product
introductions. Regulatory approval is a prerequisite for
market introduction.

4.3.2 2017 business highlights
Demonstrating the success of telehealth technologies,
Emory Healthcare (US) achieved savings of USD 4.6
million over a period of 15 months by using Philips’ eICU
platform. Similarly, with the help of Philips’ Intensive
Ambulatory Care program, Banner Health (US) reduced
hospitalizations for chronically ill patients with multiple
conditions by nearly 50%, reducing overall cost of care
by more than one third.
Expanding its health informatics portfolio, Philips
launched its IntelliSpace Enterprise Edition, an
industry-first managed service solution for hospitalwide clinical informatics and data management. The
high-performance, secure and scalable health
informatics platform enables health systems to manage
the growth and cost of their clinical enterprise with a
pay-per-use model.
In line with Philips’ focus on solutions selling, the
company signed several multi-year agreements. For
example, in Italy Philips signed a long-term strategic
partnership agreement with the San Giovanni Calibita
Fatebenefratelli Hospital in Rome to provide medical
technologies, clinical informatics and services for stateof-the-art mother and child care. In the US, Philips
expanded its relationship with Advocate Health Care,
the largest health system in Illinois, to assist them in
standardizing their clinical IT and patient monitoring
solutions across the enterprise for improved patient
outcomes and predictable costs. Furthermore, Philips
signed an agreement with Lakeland Health in the US for
advanced monitoring of patients in the hospital’s
general ward with the Philips IntelliVue Guardian
Solution with Early Warning Scoring.
Demonstrating further progress on advanced data
analytics, Philips received FDA clearance for its
IntelliSpace Portal 10 and a range of innovative
applications for radiology. The platform gives clinicians
a comprehensive view of each patient, helping them to
diagnose conditions. Further highlighting its leadership
in health informatics, Philips signed several multi-year
agreements with hospitals in the US to provide them
with enterprise imaging informatics solutions.
Philips signed a new 10-year Managed Equipment
Services agreement for patient monitoring solutions
with Le Confluent, one of the top three private hospitals
in France for cardiovascular care.
Expanding its health informatics portfolio, Philips
acquired interoperability provider Forcare in the
Netherlands. Philips also partnered with US-based

4.3.4 Healthy people, sustainable planet
Sustainability continued to play an important role in the
Connected Care & Health Informatics businesses in
2017.
Green Revenues in Connected Care & Health
Informatics amounted to EUR 1,373 million, 43% of total
segment sales, with substantial contributions from all
businesses. This reflects a continuous effort to improve
energy efficiency, materials reductions and other green
focus areas. With the growth of our software products
and services and platform solutions, we are reducing
our environmental footprint in a number of ways. For
instance through software products that can replace
hardware and the virtualization of servers. And
indirectly through eHealth and connected care
solutions that enable hospital workers to deliver faster,
more personalized care while at the same time reducing
transport to and from hospital.
In the transition towards a circular economy, we are
actively pursuing innovations in design and business
models that will help us ‘close the loop’. This includes
working together with customers and suppliers on
improving takeback and upgrades of monitors. We are
also working on closing loops for medical consumables
and sensors, partly through partnerships with suppliers
of refurbished materials. With our platform solutions
like PACS and EMR, we continue to support fast, firsttime-right diagnosis of patients, while at the same time
helping hospitals to make efficient use of resources.
Also in our operations, we continue to make positive
progress towards a circular economy by recycling 69%
of our industrial waste. At the end of 2017, 3 out of 5
Connected Care & Health Informatics businesses’
manufacturing sites reported zero waste to landfill.
Based on detailed action plans we are working closely
with the remaining sites to achieve zero waste to landfill
status by the end of 2020.

5 Reconciliation of non-IFRS
information
In this Annual Report Philips presents certain financial
measures when discussing Philips’ performance that
are not measures of financial performance or liquidity
under IFRS (‘non-IFRS’). These non-IFRS measures
(also known as non-GAAP or alternative performance
measures) are presented because management
considers them important supplemental measures of
Philips’ performance and believes that they are widely
used in the industry in which Philips operates as a
means of evaluating a company’s operating
performance and liquidity. Philips believes that an
understanding of its sales performance, profitability,
financial strength and funding requirements is
enhanced by reporting the following non-IFRS
measures:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Comparable sales growth;
Adjusted EBITA;
Adjusted EBITDA;
Free cash flow;
Net debt : group equity ratio; and
Comparable order intake.

Non-IFRS measures do not have standardized
meanings under IFRS and not all companies calculate
non-IFRS measures in the same manner or on a
consistent basis. As a result, these measures (and ratios
based on these measures) may not be comparable to
measures used by other companies that have the same
or similar names. Accordingly, undue reliance should
not be placed on the non-IFRS measures contained in
this Annual Report and they should not be considered
as substitutes for sales, net income, net cash provided
by operating activities or other financial measures
computed in accordance with IFRS.
This chapter contains the definitions of the non-IFRS
measures used in this Annual Report as well as
reconciliations from the most directly comparable IFRS
measures. The non-IFRS measures discussed in this
Annual Report are cross referenced to this chapter.
These non-IFRS measures should not be viewed in
isolation or as alternatives to equivalent IFRS measures
and should be used in conjunction with the most
directly comparable IFRS measures.
The non-IFRS financial measures presented are not
measures of financial performance or liquidity under
IFRS, but measures used by management to monitor

50

Annual Report 2017

the underlying performance of Philips’ business and
operations and, accordingly, they have not been
audited or reviewed by Philips’ external auditors.
Furthermore, they may not be indicative of Philips’
future results and should not be construed as an
indication that Philips’ future results will be unaffected
by exceptional or non-recurring items.

Comparable sales growth
Comparable sales growth represents the period-onperiod growth in sales excluding the effects of currency
movements and changes in consolidation. As indicated
in note 1, Significant accounting policies, to the Philips
Group financial statements, foreign currency sales and
costs are translated into Philips’ presentation currency,
the euro, at the exchange rates prevailing at the
respective transaction dates. As a result of significant
foreign currency sales and currency movements during
the periods presented, the effects of translating foreign
currency sales amounts into euros could have a
material impact on the comparability of sales between
periods. Therefore, these impacts are excluded when
presenting comparable sales in euros by translating the
foreign currency sales of the previous period and the
current period into euros at the same average exchange
rates. In addition, the years under review were affected
by a number of acquisitions and divestments, as a result
of which various activities were consolidated or
deconsolidated. The effect of consolidation changes
has also been excluded in arriving at the comparable
sales. For the purpose of calculating comparable sales,
when a previously consolidated entity is sold or control
is lost, relevant sales for that entity of the corresponding
prior year period are excluded. Similarly, when an entity
is acquired and consolidated, relevant sales for that
entity of the current year period are excluded.
Comparable sales growth is presented for the Philips
Group, operating segments and geographic clusters.
Philips’ believes that the presentation of comparable
sales growth is meaningful for investors to evaluate the
performance of Philips’ business activities over time.
Comparable sales growth may be subject to limitations
as an analytical tool for investors, because comparable
sales growth figures are not adjusted for other effects,
such as increases or decreases in prices or quantity/
volume. In addition, interaction effects between
currency movements and changes in consolidation
(second order effects) are not taken into account.

Adjusted EBITA
The term Adjusted EBITA is used to evaluate the
performance of Philips and its segments. EBITA
represents Income from operations excluding
amortization and impairment of acquired intangible
assets and impairment of goodwill. Adjusted EBITA
represents EBITA excluding gains or losses from
restructuring costs, acquisition-related charges and
other items.
Restructuring costs are defined as the estimated costs
of initiated reorganizations, the most significant of
which have been approved by the Executive
Committee, and which generally involve the
realignment of certain parts of the industrial and
commercial organization.
Acquisition-related charges are defined as costs that
are directly triggered by the acquisition of a company,
such as transaction costs, purchase accounting related
costs and integration-related expenses.
Other items are defined as any individual item with an
income statement impact (loss or gain) that is deemed
by management to be both significant and incidental to
normal business activity. Other items may extend over
several quarters and are not limited to the same
financial year.
Philips considers use of Adjusted EBITA appropriate as
Philips uses it as a measure of segment performance
and as one of its strategic drivers to increase
profitability through re-allocation of its resources
towards opportunities offering more consistent and
higher returns. This is done with the aim of making the
underlying performance of the businesses more
transparent.
Philips believes Adjusted EBITA is useful to evaluate
financial performance on a comparable basis over time
by factoring out restructuring costs, acquisition-related
charges and other incidental items which are not
directly related to the operational performance of
Philips Group or its segments.
Adjusted EBITA may be subject to limitations as an
analytical tool for investors, as it excludes restructuring
costs, acquisition-related charges and other incidental
items and therefore does not reflect the expense
associated with such items, which may be significant
and have a significant effect on Philips’ net income.
Adjusted EBITA margin refers to Adjusted EBITA
divided by sales expressed as a percentage.

52

Annual Report 2017

Adjusted EBITA is not a recognized measure of financial
performance under IFRS. Below is a reconciliation of
Adjusted EBITA to the most directly comparable IFRS
measure, Net income, for the years indicated. Net
income is not allocated to segments as certain income
and expense line items are monitored on a centralized
basis, resulting in them being shown on a Philips Group
level only.

Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as Income from operations
excluding amortization and impairment of intangible
assets, impairment of goodwill, depreciation and
impairment of property, plant and equipment,
restructuring costs, acquisition-related charges and
other items.
Philips understands that Adjusted EBITDA is broadly
used by analysts, rating agencies and investors in their
evaluation of different companies because it excludes
certain items that can vary widely across different
industries or among companies within the same
industry. Philips considers Adjusted EBITDA useful
when comparing its performance to other companies in
the HealthTech industry. However, Adjusted EBITDA
may be subject to limitations as an analytical tool
because of the range of items excluded and their
significance in a given reporting period. Furthermore,
comparisons with other companies may be
complicated due to the absence of a standardized
meaning and calculation framework. Our management
compensates for the limitations of using Adjusted
EBITDA by using this measure to supplement IFRS
results to provide a more complete understanding of
the factors and trends affecting the business rather than
IFRS results alone. In addition to the limitations noted
above, Adjusted EBITDA excludes items that may be
recurring in nature and should not be disregarded in the
evaluation of performance. However, we believe it is
useful to exclude such items to provide a supplemental
analysis of current results and trends compared to
other periods because certain excluded items can vary
significantly depending on specific underlying
transactions or events, and the variability of such items
may not relate specifically to ongoing operating results
or trends and certain excluded items, while potentially
recurring in future periods, may not be indicative of
future results. A reconciliation from net income to
Adjusted EBITDA is provided below.

Free cash flow
Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by
operating activities minus net capital expenditures. Net
capital expenditures are comprised of the purchase of
intangible assets, expenditures on development assets,
capital expenditures on property, plant and equipment
and proceeds from sales of property, plant and
equipment.
Philips discloses free cash flow as a supplemental nonIFRS financial measure, as Philips believes it is a
meaningful measure to evaluate the performance of its
business activities over time. Philips understands that
free cash flow is broadly used by analysts, rating
agencies and investors in assessing its performance.
Philips also believes that the presentation of free cash
flow provides useful information to investors regarding
the cash generated by the Philips operations after
deducting cash outflows for purchases of intangible
assets, capitalization of product
development, expenditures on development assets,

capital expenditures on property, plant and equipment
and proceeds from disposal of property, plant and
equipment. Therefore, the measure gives an indication
of the long-term cash generating ability of the business.
In addition, because free cash flow is not impacted by
purchases or sales of businesses and investments, it is
generally less volatile than the total of net cash
provided by operating activities and net cash provided
used for investing activities.
Free cash flow may be subject to limitations as an
analytical tool for investors, as free cash flow is not a
measure of cash generated by operations available
exclusively for discretionary expenditures and Philips
requires funds in addition to those required for capital
expenditures for a wide variety of non-discretionary
expenditures, such as payments on outstanding debt,
dividend payments or other investing and financing
activities. In addition, free cash flow does not reflect
cash payments that may be required in future for costs
already incurred, such as restructuring costs.

Net debt : group equity ratio
Net debt : group equity ratio is presented to express the
financial strength of Philips. Net debt is defined as the
sum of long- and short-term debt minus cash and cash
equivalents. Group equity is defined as the sum of
shareholders’ equity and non-controlling interests. This
measure is used by Philips Treasury management and
investment analysts to evaluate financial strength and

funding requirements. This measure may be subject to
limitations because cash and cash equivalents are used
for various purposes, not only debt repayment. The net
debt calculation deducts all cash and cash equivalents
whereas these items are not necessarily available
exclusively for debt repayment at any given time.

Comparable order intake
Comparable order intake is reported for equipment and
software and is defined as the total contractually
committed amount to be delivered within a specified
timeframe excluding the effects of currency
movements and changes in consolidation. Comparable
order intake does not derive from the financial
statements and thus a quantitative reconciliation is not
provided.
Philips uses comparable order intake as an indicator of
business activity and performance. Comparable order
intake is not an alternative to revenue and may be
subject to limitations as an analytical tool due to
differences in amount and timing between booking
orders and revenue recognition. Due to divergence in
practice, other companies may calculate this or a similar
measure (such as order backlog) differently and
therefore comparisons between companies may be
complicated.

Risk management 6

6 Risk management
6.1 Our approach to risk management
The Executive Committee, supported by the Risk
Management Support Team, oversees and manages
risks associated with Philips’ strategy and activities. The
Risk Management Support Team consists of a number
of functional experts covering the various categories of
enterprise risk and supports by increasing the
understanding of the enterprise risk profile and
continuously working to improve the enterprise risk
management framework. The Executive Committee is
ultimately responsible for identifying the critical risks
and for the implementation of appropriate risk
responses. The Supervisory Board is periodically
updated about enterprise risks and the risk
management process in Philips.
Philips believes risk management is a value creating
activity and as such it is an integral element of the
Philips Business System (PBS). Risk management and
control supports us in taking sound risk-reward
strategic decisions to maximize value creation, it
supports sustainable results on our Path to Value, it
protects our key strengths (Capabilities, Assets, and
Positions) and it supports process excellence.
Philips’ risk management focuses on the following risk
categories: Strategic, Operational, Compliance and
Financial risks. The main risks within these categories
are further described in section 6.2, Risk categories and
factors, of this Annual Report. The overview highlights
the material risks known to Philips, which could hinder
it in achieving its strategic and financial business
objectives. The risk overview may, however, not include
all the risks that may ultimately affect Philips. Some
risks not yet known to Philips, or currently believed not
to be material, could ultimately have a major impact on
Philips’ businesses, objectives, revenues, income,
assets, liquidity or capital resources.
All forward-looking statements made on or after the
date of this Annual Report and attributable to Philips
are expressly qualified in their entirety by the factors
described in the cautionary statement included in
chapter 17, Forward-looking statements and other
information, of this Annual Report and the overview of
risk factors described in section 6.2, Risk categories and
factors, of this Annual Report.

Risk Management Framework
Risk management and control forms an integral part of
the Philips business planning and performance review
cycle. The company’s risk and control policy is designed
to provide reasonable assurance that objectives are
met by integrating risk assessment in the strategic
planning process, integrating management control into
the daily operations, ensuring compliance with legal
requirements and safeguarding the integrity of the

58

Annual Report 2017

company’s financial reporting and its related
disclosures. It makes management responsible for
identifying the critical business risks and for the
implementation of appropriate risk responses. Philips’
risk management approach is embedded in the areas
of Corporate Governance, elements of the Philips
Business System (Strategic Investment Decision
Making, Asset Protection, Operational Excellence,
Planning & Performance Cycle), Philips Business
Control Framework and Philips General Business
Principles. Structured risk assessments take place
according to the Philips process standard for managing
risk.

Risk appetite
Philips’ risk management policy addresses risks related
to different categories: Strategic, Operational,
Compliance and Financial risks. The Executive
Committee and management consider risk appetite
when taking decisions and seek to manage risks
consistently within the risk appetite. Risk boundaries
are set in the various parts of our governance
framework including (but not limited to) our Strategy,
General Business Principles (GBP), Policies, Philips
Business System (PBS), Budgets and Authority
schedules. Risk appetite is different for the various risk
categories:
• Strategic risks and opportunities may affect Philips’
strategic ambitions. Strategic risks include economic
and political developments and the need to
anticipate and respond timely to market
circumstances. Philips is prepared to take
considerable strategic risks in a responsible way
given the necessity to invest in research &
development and manage the portfolio of
businesses, including acquisitions and divestments,
in a highly uncertain global political and economic
environment. Philips carefully evaluates if risk taking
is justified in light of Strategic Fit, Portfolio Balance,
and overall Value creation ambitions. Philips seeks to
avoid risks which dilute or contradict our Brand
promise.
• Operational risks include adverse developments
resulting from internal processes, people and
systems, or from external events that are linked to the
actual running of each business (examples are
solution and product creation and supply chain
management). Our focus on Quality, Excellence and
Productivity enhancement guide the day-to-day
running and the continuous improvement of our
business. Philips takes a calculated approach aimed
to optimize the upside and minimize the downside of
risks due to the need for high quality of its products
and services, reliable and secure IT systems and
sustainability commitments.

Risk management 6.1

• Compliance risks cover unanticipated failures to
implement, or comply with, appropriate laws,
regulations, policies and procedures. Philips attaches
prime importance to product quality and safety,
including full compliance with regulations and
quality standards applicable to our products and
services. Being a responsible company everyone in
Philips is expected to always act with integrity.
Philips rigorously enforces compliance of General
Business Principles throughout the Company.
Philips has a zero tolerance policy towards noncompliance in relation to breaches of its General
Business Principles.
• Financial risks include risks related to Treasury,
Accounting and Reporting, Pensions and Tax. Philips
is prudent with regard to financial risks as the
financial sustainability of the company and investor
commitment depends on it. Philips is averse to risks
which jeopardize a sustained “Investment grade”
credit rating and risks which impede the reliability of
our financial reporting. Risk appetite is described
further in various chapters of this annual report,
including note 29, Details of treasury / other financial
risks.
Philips does not classify these risk categories in order
of importance.

Philips’ corporate governance structure can be found in
chapter 10, Corporate governance, of this Annual
Report.

Risk Management
Taking risks is an inherent part of entrepreneurial
behavior and well-structured risk management allows
management to take risks in a controlled manner. In
order to provide a comprehensive view of Philips’ risks,
structured risk assessments take place according to the
Philips process standard for risk management,
combining elements of a top-down and bottom-up
approach. The process is supported by workshops with
management at Business, Market and Group Function
levels. During 2017, several risk management
workshops were held.

Corporate Governance
Corporate governance is the system by which a
company is directed and controlled. Philips believes
that good corporate governance is a critical factor in
achieving business success. Good corporate
governance derives from, among other things, effective
internal controls and high ethical standards. The quality
of Philips’ system of risk management, business control
and other findings of internal and external audits are
reported to and discussed by the Audit Committee of
the Supervisory Board. Internal auditors monitor the
quality of risk management and business controls
through the execution of the risk based audit plan as
approved by the Audit Committee of the Supervisory
Board.
Audit & Risk committees at Group level, Business
Groups, Markets and key Functional areas meet
quarterly, chaired by first line leadership, to address
weaknesses in risk management and business controls
structure as reported by internal and external auditors
or revealed by self-assessment of management and to
take corrective action where necessary. In addition to
the Audit Committee, the Quality and Regulatory (Q&R)
Committee of the Supervisory Board assists the
Supervisory Board in fulfilling its oversight
responsibilities particularly in respect of the quality of
the Company’s products, systems, services and
software and the development, testing, manufacturing,
marketing and servicing thereof, and regulatory
requirements relating thereto. As such, the Q&R
Committee supports the Company’s risk management
in the relevant risk areas. An in-depth description of

Key elements of the Philips risk management policy
are:

assessed and prioritized on their impact on
objectives, likelihood of occurrence and
effectiveness of controls. Management is
accountable for the timely development of effective
risk responses.

Risk management 6.1

• Developments in the risk profile and management’s
initiatives to improve risk responses are explicitly
discussed and monitored during the quarterly Audit
& Risk Committees and in the Quarterly Performance
Reviews (QPR).
• As an integral part of the strategy review, the
Executive Committee annually assesses the
enterprise risk profile, including appropriate risk
scenarios and sensitivity analysis, and reviews the
potential impact of the enterprise risk profile versus
the Group’s risk appetite. This risk assessment is
based on the latest annual risk assessments of the
Group, Business Groups, Markets and key Functions
and changes to these, if any, as reported during the
periodic review meetings, findings from Philips
Internal Audit, Legal and Insurance, the Materiality
analysis as described in chapter 13, Sustainability
statements, of this Annual Report, views from key
stakeholders, external analysis, and risks reported in
the annual certification statement on Risk
Management and Business Controls.
• Developments in the Enterprise Risk profile and
management’s initiatives to improve risk responses
are discussed and monitored during the quarterly
Group Audit & Risk Committee.
• The Executive Committee reviews at least annually
the Philips risk management approach and improves
the process as required.
• The Philips risk profile and the risk management
approach are discussed at least annually with the
Audit Committee and with the full Supervisory Board.
Examples of measures taken during 2017 to further
strengthen risk management, which have been
discussed with the Audit Committee and the full
Supervisory Board:
• Execution of the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)
improvement roadmap;
• The continued development of the Information
Security Program in light of the increasing exposure
to cybercrime and information security requirements
resulting from digitalization and a focus on the
Healthcare industry;
• The further development of risk management related
to long-term service-based business models;
• Introduction of improved comprehensive insurance
program;
• Accelerated acquisition integration supported by
playbooks;
• Revised plan for GBP deployment for the next 3
years;
• Strengthened Q&R framework and oversight,
standardization of Philips Quality Management
System across the Company, and Quality
improvement campaign;
• Closing of sale of 80.1% interest in Lumileds and sale
of substantial part of Lighting resulting in
deconsolidation of Philips Lighting during 2017;
• Further de-risking of pension liabilities liabilities with
deficit funding in the US defined-benefit plan and
settlement of the Brazilian pension plans;

60

Annual Report 2017

• Continuous improvement of risk dialogues and
continuation of risk workshops to cover Business
Groups, Markets and Functions.

Philips Business Control Framework
The Philips Business Control Framework (BCF) sets the
standard for risk management and business control in
Philips. The objectives of the BCF are to maintain
integrated management control of the company’s
operations, in order to ensure the integrity of the
financial reporting, as well as compliance with laws and
regulations. Philips has designed its BCF based on the
“Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013)”
established by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
Philips continuously evaluates and improves its BCF to
align with business dynamics and good practice.
As part of the BCF, Philips has implemented a global
standard for internal control over financial reporting
(ICS). ICS, together with Philips’ established accounting
procedures, is designed to provide reasonable
assurance that assets are safeguarded, that the books
and records properly reflect transactions necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements, that policies
and procedures are carried out by qualified personnel
and that published financial statements are properly
prepared and do not contain any material
misstatements. ICS has been deployed in all material
reporting units, where business process owners
perform an extensive number of controls, document
the results each quarter, and take corrective action
where necessary. ICS supports business and functional
management in a quarterly cycle of assessment and
monitoring of its control environment. The findings of
management’s evaluation are reported to the
Executive Committee and the Audit Committee of the
Supervisory Board quarterly.
As part of the Annual Report process, management’s
accountability for business controls is enforced through
the formal certification statement sign off by Business
Group, Market and Functional management to the
Executive Committee. Any deficiencies noted in the
design and operating effectiveness of controls over
financial reporting which were not completely
remediated are evaluated at year-end by the Board of
Management. The Board of Management’s report,
including its conclusions regarding the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting, can be found
in section 11.1, Management’s report on internal
control, of this Annual Report.

Philips General Business Principles
The Philips General Business Principles (GBP)
incorporate and represent the fundamental principles
by which all Philips businesses and employees around
the globe must abide. They set the minimum standard
for business conduct, both for individual employees
and for the company and our subsidiaries. Our GBP also
serve as a reference for the business conduct we expect
from our business partners and suppliers. Translations

Risk management 6.1

of the GBP text are available in 32 languages, allowing
almost every employee to read the GBP in their native
language. Detailed underlying policies, manuals,
training, and tools are in place to give employees
practical guidance on how to apply and uphold the GBP
in their daily work environments.
The GBP form an integral part of labor contracts in
virtually every country in which Philips operates. It is the
responsibility of each employee to live up to our GBP,
and employees are requested to affirm their
commitment to the principles after completing their
GBP e-training. In addition, there are separate Codes of
Ethics that apply to employees working in specific areas
of our business, i.e. the Procurement Code of Ethics and
the Financial Code of Ethics. Details can be found at:
www.philips.com/gbp. Executives are requested to
sign off on the GBP each year to renew their awareness
of and reaffirm their compliance with these principles.
Within Philips, the GBP Review Committee is ultimately
responsible for the effective deployment of the GBP
and for generally promoting a culture of compliance
and ethics within the company. The GBP Review
Committee is chaired by the Chief Legal Officer, and its
members include the Chief HR Officer, the Chief of
International Markets and the Chief Financial Officer.
They are supported in the implementation of their
initiatives by a Committee Secretariat as well as a
network of GBP Compliance Officers, who are
appointed in all markets, countries and at all major sites
where Philips has operations. Furthermore, building on
the best practices we have developed in some of our
markets, in 2018 all markets will install a formal
compliance committee, consisting of (at least) the
market leader, the market head of legal and the market
CFO, which will deal with GBP related matters on a
more granular level.
As part of our unyielding effort to raise GBP awareness
and foster dialog throughout the organization, each
year a global GBP communications and training plan is
deployed. In 2017, a number of initiatives were
undertaken through various channels such as new
Quick Reference Cards for at-a-glance guidance on
how to handle a number of common GBP issues, as well
as recurring programs such as e-learnings for selected
high-risk audiences. For our GBP e-learning, we
achieved a training completion rate of 96%. Many of
these initiatives contributed to building momentum
toward our now annual GBP Dialogue Initiative. In 2017,
in order to accommodate the increased demand from
the markets and business, we held our Dialogue
Initiative over the course of two months beginning in
May and ending in June, allowing ample time and
scope for teams and leaders alike to arrange and
prepare for their dialog session. During the 2017
Dialogue Initiative, more teams at Philips than ever
before held open and frank discussions on what Acting
with Integrity means to them, and posted pictures of
their sessions on the Philips social platform using the
hashtag #integritymatters.

The effect of our communication and awareness
campaigns is apparent from the results of our biennial
Business Integrity Survey. Via this survey, in which tens
of thousands of Philips employees participated, we
measure employee’s perception of integrity throughout
the company. For the second time running our scores
improved for all the soft-controls we measure.
As one of our important controls for monitoring and
oversight of the level of GBP compliance within Philips,
we deploy quarterly the mandatory GBP selfassessment as part of our Internal Control framework.
The GBP Review Committee Secretariat receives an
overview of the results of this self-assessment and can
take action when deemed necessary. We believe this
has created a more robust network to ensure
compliance throughout the organization and it has
equipped us with the requisite skills and support to
monitor and enhance compliance in the increasingly
regulated environments in which Philips operates.
Furthermore, 2017 saw the creation of a dedicated
compliance monitoring team, which will leverage data
analytics to quickly identify and address potential
compliance issues.
The GBP are supported by established mechanisms
that ensure standardized reporting and escalation of
concerns where necessary. These mechanisms are
based on the GBP Reporting Policy, which urges
employees to report any concerns they may have
regarding business conduct in relation to the GBP. They
can do this either through a GBP Compliance Officer or
through the Philips Ethics Line, which enables
employees and also third parties to report a concern
either by telephone or online in a variety of different
languages 24/7 all year round. Concerns raised are
registered consistently in a single database hosted
outside of Philips servers to ensure confidentiality and
security of identity and information. Encouraging
people to submit a complaint when they have
exhausted all other means of recourse had been - and
will continue to be - a cornerstone of our GBP
communications and awareness campaign year on
year.

Financial Code of Ethics
The Company has a Financial Code of Ethics which
applies to the CEO (the principal executive officer) and
CFO (the principal financial and principal accounting
officer), and to the senior management in the Philips
Finance Leadership Team who head the Finance
departments of the Company. The Company has
published its Financial Code of Ethics within the
investor section of its website located at
www.philips.com. No changes were considered
necessary and no changes have been made to the
Financial Code of Ethics since its adoption and no
waivers have been granted therefrom to the officers
mentioned above in 2017.

General Business Principles, of this Annual Report.

6.2 Risk categories and factors
In order to provide a comprehensive view of Philips’
enterprise risks, structured risk assessments take place
in accordance with the Philips process standard to
manage risk as described in section 6.1, Our approach
to risk management, of this Annual Report. As a result
of this process, amongst others, the following actions
were performed during 2017:
• In order to reduce its exposure to market risk, Philips
continued in 2017 to sell portions of its ownership of
Lighting; by the end of 2017 Philips was no longer
able to exercise control over Lighting and as a result
Lighting has been deconsolidated. Until the
completion of the sale of its entire ownership in
Philips Lighting, Philips remains exposed to risks with
regard to the value of Philips Lighting.
• In 2017 the sale of 80.1% of Lumileds was completed;
Philips remains exposed to risks with regard to the
value of the remaining 19.9% stake in Lumileds.
• The challenging global political and economic
developments had an impact on our results. We have
continued to monitor the impact of economic and
political developments on our results.
• Philips has strengthened its (cyber) security
governance to increase the ability to detect, respond
to and close (cyber) security incidents.
• Philips has continued its significant investments in its
Quality Management System across the company.
Changes in the company-wide quality leadership
have been made and new standards and initiatives
have been launched.
Philips describes the risk factors within each risk
category in order of Philips’ current view of expected
significance, to give stakeholders an insight into which
risks and opportunities it considers more prominent
than others at present. The risk overview highlights the
main risks and opportunities known to Philips, which
could hinder it in achieving its strategic and financial
business objectives. The risk overview may, however,
not include all the risks that may ultimately affect
Philips. Describing risk factors in their order of expected
significance within each risk category does not mean
that a lower listed risk factor may not have a material
and adverse impact on Philips’ business, strategic

62

Annual Report 2017

objectives, revenues, income, assets, liquidity, capital
resources or achievement of Philips’ goals.
Furthermore, a risk factor described after other risk
factors may ultimately prove to have more significant
adverse consequences than those other risk factors.
Over time Philips may change its view as to the relative
significance of each risk factor.

6.3 Strategic risks
Philips may be unable to adapt swiftly to changes in
industry or market circumstances, which could have a
material adverse impact on its financial condition and
results.
Fundamental shifts in the Healthcare industry, like the
transition towards digital, may drastically change the
business environment. If Philips is unable to recognize
these changes in good time, is late in adjusting its
business models, or if circumstances arise such as
pricing actions by competitors, then this could have a
material adverse effect on Philips’ growth ambitions,
financial condition and operating result.
As Philips’ business is global, its operations are exposed
to economic and political developments in countries
across the world that could adversely impact its
financial condition and results.
Philips ’ business environment is influenced by political
and economic conditions in individual and global
markets. Financial markets generally showed a stable,
favorable performance during 2017 with market
volatility at an all-time low; towards the end of 2017
concerns emerged about potential bubbles in some
financial markets. Economic growth in China seems to
have stabilized. The European Union started to show
clear economic growth in 2017 and so far seems
unaffected by the lack of progress in the Brexit process.
Political uncertainty remains a driver of potential risks
in Europe. The weakened government in Great Britain
continues to struggle with the Brexit negotiations. The
US economy continued to perform well during 2017, but
the initial optimism following the start of the new US
administration in 2017 has slacked off. The long awaited
US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was only presented at the end

Risk management 6.3

of 2017 and it is uncertain what the impact of this tax
reform will be. The US dollar lost strength versus the
euro and Japanese yen during the second half of 2017;
there is considerable uncertainty about the potential
impact of the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on the strength
of the US dollar. Both Brexit and the policies of the US
administration may have significant impact on
international trade tariffs and customs laws. Driven by
political conflicts, 2017 showed further increases in the
quantity and severity of cyber-attacks; some attacks
(e.g. WannaCry) affected many countries and public
and private organizations. The favorable
macroeconomic outlook for the main geographies
could quickly reverse due to political conflicts, the
unknown impact of changes in US and Eurozone
monetary policy and changes in government policies.
Uncertainty remains as to the levels of (public) capital
expenditures in general, unemployment levels and
consumer and business confidence, which could
adversely affect demand for products and services
offered by Philips.
The general global political environment remains
unfavorable for the business environment due to
continued political conflicts and terrorism. Numerous
other factors, such as regional political conflicts in the
Middle East, Turkey, Korean peninsula and other
regions, as well as large-scale (in)voluntary migration
and profound social instability could continue to impact
macroeconomic factors and the international capital
and credit markets. It remains difficult to predict
changes in, among others, US foreign policy, healthcare
and trade and tax laws, the impact of which cannot be
predicted. Uncertainty on the timing and the nature of
Brexit may adversely affect economic growth and the
business environment in the United Kingdom and the
European Union. Economic and political uncertainty
may have a material adverse impact on Philips’
financial condition or results of operations and can also
make it more difficult for Philips to budget and forecast
accurately. Political instability may have an adverse
impact on financial markets which could have a
negative impact on the timing and revenues of the sale
of the remaining interests in Lighting and the access of
Philips to funding. Philips may encounter difficulty in
planning and managing operations due to the lack of
adequate infrastructure and unfavorable political
factors, including unexpected legal or regulatory
changes such as foreign exchange import or export
controls, increased healthcare regulation,
nationalization of assets or restrictions on the
repatriation of returns from foreign investments. Given
that growth in emerging market countries is correlated
to US, Chinese and European economic growth and
that such emerging market countries are increasingly
important in Philips’ operations, the above-mentioned
risks are also expected to grow and could have a
material adverse effect on Philips’ financial condition
and results.

Philips’ overall risk profile is changing as a result of the
focus on Health Technology.
The risk profile of Philips is expected to concentrate
focus on one industry due to the dynamics of our
changing products and services portfolio, acquisitions
and partnerships resulting from the execution of our
Health Technology strategy.
Philips’ overall performance in the coming years is
expected to depend on the realization of its growth
ambitions and results in growth geographies.
Growth geographies are becoming increasingly
important in the global market. In addition, Asia is an
important production, sourcing and design center for
Philips. Philips faces strong competition to attract the
best talent in tight labor markets and intense
competition from local companies as well as other
global players for market share in growth geographies.
Philips needs to maintain and grow its position in
growth geographies, invest in data driven services,
invest in local talent, understand developments in enduser preferences and localize the portfolio in order to
stay competitive. If Philips fails to achieve these
objectives, then this could have a material adverse
effect on growth ambitions, financial condition and
operating result.
The growth ambitions and the related financial results
of Philips may be adversely affected by economic
volatility inherent in growth geographies and the
impact of changes in macroeconomic circumstances on
growth economies.
Philips may not control joint ventures or associated
companies in which it invests, which could limit the
ability of Philips to identify and manage risks.
Philips has invested and may invest in joint ventures
and associated companies in which Philips will have a
non-controlling interest. In these cases, Philips has
limited influence over, and limited or no control of, the
governance, performance and cost of operations of
joint ventures and associated companies. Some of
these joint ventures and associated companies may
represent significant investments and potentially also
use Philips’ brand. The joint ventures and associated
companies that Philips does not control may make
business, financial or investment decisions contrary to
Philips’ interests or may make decisions different from
those that Philips itself may have made. Additionally,
Philips partners or members of a joint venture or
associated company may not be able to meet their
financial or other obligations, which could expose
Philips to additional financial or other obligations, as
well as having a material adverse effect on the value of
its investments in those entities or potentially subject
Philips to additional claims. Lumileds is an example of
a company in which Philips may continue to have a
(residual) investment but does not have control.

Annual Report 2017

Risk management 6.3

Acquisitions could expose Philips to integration risks
and challenge management in continuing to reduce the
complexity of the company.
Philips’ acquisitions may expose Philips in the future to
integration risks in areas such as sales and service force
integration, logistics, regulatory compliance,
information technology and finance. Integration
difficulties and complexity may adversely impact the
realization of an increased contribution from
acquisitions. Philips may incur significant acquisition,
administrative and other costs in connection with these
transactions, including costs related to the integration
of acquired businesses. Acquisitions may divert
management attention from other business priorities
and risks.
Furthermore, organizational simplification expected to
be implemented following an acquisition and the
resulting cost savings may be difficult to achieve.
Acquisitions may also lead to a substantial increase in
long-lived assets, including goodwill. Write-downs of
these assets due to business developments may have
a material adverse effect on Philips’ earnings (see also
note 11, Goodwill).
Philips’ inability to secure and maintain intellectual
property rights for products, whilst maintaining overall
competitiveness, could have a material adverse effect
on its results.
Philips is dependent on its ability to obtain and
maintain licenses and other intellectual property (IP)
rights covering its products and its design and
manufacturing processes. The IP portfolio is the result
of an extensive patenting process that could be
influenced by a number of factors, including innovation.
The value of the IP portfolio is dependent on the
successful promotion and market acceptance of
standards developed or co-developed by Philips. This
is particularly applicable to Personal Health where
third-party licenses are important and a loss or
impairment could have a material adverse impact on
Philips’ financial condition and operating results.

6.4 Operational risks
Failure to comply with quality standards, regulations
and associated regulatory actions can trigger warranty
and product liability claims against Philips and can lead
to financial losses and adversely impact Philips’
reputation, market share and brand.
Philips is required to comply with the high standards of
quality in the manufacture of its medical devices.
Philips hereto is subject to the supervision of various
national regulatory authorities. Conditions imposed by
such national regulatory authorities could result in
product recalls or a temporary ban on products and/or
production facilities. In addition quality issues and/or
liability claims could affect Philips’ reputation and its
relationships with key customers (both customers for
end products and customers that use Philips’ products

64

Annual Report 2017

in their business processes). As a result, depending on
the product and manufacturing site concerned and the
severity of the quality and/or regulatory issue, this
could lead to financial losses through lost revenue and
costs of any required remedial actions, and have further
impacts on Philips’ reputation, market share and brand.
Please refer to section 6.5, Compliance risks, of this
Annual Report.
A breach in security of, or a significant disruption in, our
information technology systems or violation of data
privacy laws could adversely affect our operating
results, financial condition, reputation and brand.
Philips relies on information technology to operate and
manage its businesses and store confidential data
(relating to employees, customers, intellectual
property, suppliers and other partners); Philips’
products, solutions and services increasingly contain
sophisticated information technology and generate
confidential data related to customers and patients.
Like many other multinational companies, Philips is
therefore inherently and increasingly exposed to the
risk of cyber attacks. Information systems may be
damaged, disrupted (including the provision of services
to customers) or shut down due to (cyber) attacks by
hackers, computer viruses or other malware. In
addition, breaches in security of our systems (or the
systems of our customers, suppliers or other business
partners) could result in the misappropriation,
destruction or unauthorized disclosure of confidential
information (including intellectual property) or
personal data belonging to us or to our employees,
partners, customers or suppliers. Successful cyberattacks may result in substantial costs and other
negative consequences, which may include, but are not
limited to, lost revenues, reputational damage,
remediation costs, and other liabilities to regulators,
customers and partners. Furthermore, enhanced
protection measures can involve significant costs.
Philips has strengthened its security governance, thus
increasing the ability to detect, respond to, and close
incidents. Additionally foundational and risk-based
security training has been provided throughout the
organization. For Mergers & Acquisitions, specific
attention is given to ensure a sufficient level of security
maturity before and during the M&A processes,
including post-merger integration. However, these
efforts may prove to be insufficient or unsuccessful.
Although Philips has experienced cyber-attacks and to
date has not incurred any significant damage as a result
an did not incur significant monetary cost in taking
corrective action, there can be no assurance that in the
future Philips will be as successful in avoiding damage
from cyber-attacks, which could lead to financial
losses. Additionally, the integration of new companies
and successful outsourcing of business processes are
highly dependent on secure and well controlled IT
systems.

Risk management 6.4

Diversity in information technology (IT) could result in
ineffective or inefficient business management. IT
outsourcing and off-shoring strategies could result in
complexities in service delivery and contract
management.
Philips continuously seeks to create a more open,
standardized and cost-effective IT landscape, including
through further outsourcing, off-shoring,
commoditization and ongoing reduction in the number
of IT systems. These changes create risk with regard to
the delivery of IT services, the availability of IT systems
and the scope and nature of the functionality offered
by IT systems. Philips has strengthened the security
clauses in supplier contracts, has increased the
compliance reviews for those contracts (internally and
externally) and has instigated more reviews on key
suppliers with regard to information security. However
these measures may prove to be insufficient or
unsuccessful.
If Philips is unable to ensure effective supply chain
management, e.g. facing an interruption of its supply
chain, including the inability of third parties to deliver
parts, components and services on time, and if it is
subject to rising raw material prices, it may be unable
to sustain its competitiveness in its markets.
Philips is continuing the process of creating a leaner
supply base with fewer suppliers, while maintaining
dual/multiple sourcing strategies where possible. This
strategy very much requires close cooperation with
suppliers to enhance, among other things, time to
market and quality. In addition, Philips is continuing its
initiatives to replace internal capabilities with less
costly outsourced products and services. These
processes may result in increased dependency on
external suppliers and providers. Although Philips
works closely with its suppliers to avoid supply-related
problems, there can be no assurance that it will not
encounter supply problems in the future or that it will
be able to replace a supplier that is not able to meet its
demand sufficiently quickly to avoid disruptions.
Shortages or delays could materially harm its business.
Most of Philips’ activities are conducted outside of the
Netherlands, and international operations bring
challenges. For example, Philips depends partly on the
production and procurement of products and parts
from Asian countries, and this constitutes a risk that
production and shipping of products and parts could be
interrupted by regional conflicts, a natural disaster or
extreme weather events resulting from climate change.
A general shortage of materials, components or
subcomponents as a result of natural disasters also
poses the risk of unforeseeable fluctuations in prices
and demand, which could have a material adverse
effect on Philips’ financial condition and operating
results.

Philips purchases raw materials, including so-called
rare earth metals, copper, steel, aluminum, noble gases
and oil-related products, which exposes it to
fluctuations in energy and raw material prices. In recent
times, commodities have been subject to volatile
markets, and such volatility is expected to continue. If
Philips is not able to compensate for increased costs or
pass them on to customers, price increases could have
a material adverse impact on Philips’ results. In
contrast, in times of falling commodity prices, Philips
may not fully benefit from such price decreases, since
Philips attempts to reduce the risk of rising commodity
prices by several means, including long-term
contracting or physical and financial hedging.
Failure to drive operational excellence and productivity
in Philips’ solution and product creation process
and/or increased speed in innovation-to-market could
hamper Philips’ profitable growth ambitions.
Further improvements in Philips’ solution and product
creation process, ensuring timely delivery of new
solutions and products at lower cost and improvement
in customer service levels to create sustainable
competitive advantages, are important in realizing
Philips’ profitable growth ambitions. The emergence of
new low-cost competitors, particularly in Asia, further
underlines the importance of improvements in the
product creation process. The success of new solution
and product creation, however, depends on a number
of factors, including timely and successful completion
of development efforts, market acceptance, Philips’
ability to manage the risks associated with new
products and production ramp-up issues, the ability of
Philips to attract and retain employees with the
appropriate skills, the availability of products in the
right quantities and at appropriate costs to meet
anticipated demand and the risk that new products and
services may have quality or other defects in the early
stages of introduction. Accordingly, Philips cannot
determine in advance the ultimate effect that new
solutions and product creations will have on its financial
condition and operating results. If Philips fails to create
and commercialize products or fails to ensure that enduser insights are translated into solution and product
creations that improve product mix and consequently
contribution, it may lose its market share and
competitiveness, which could have a material adverse
effect on its financial condition and operating results.
Because Philips is dependent on its personnel for
leadership and specialized skills, the loss of its ability to
attract and retain such personnel would have an
adverse effect on its business.
The attraction and retention of talented employees in
sales and marketing, research and development,
finance and general management, as well as of highly
specialized technical personnel, especially in
transferring technologies to low-cost countries, is
critical to Philips’ success particularly in times of
economic recovery. The loss of specialized skills could

Annual Report 2017

65

Risk management 6.4

also result in business interruptions. There can be no
assurance that Philips will be successful in attracting
and retaining highly qualified employees and key
personnel needed in the future.
Risk of unauthorized use of intellectual property rights.
Philips produces and sells products and services which
incorporate technology protected by intellectual
property rights. Philips develops and acquires
intellectual property rights on a regular basis. Philips is
exposed to the risk that a third party may claim to own
the intellectual property rights on technology applied
in Philips products and services and that in the event
that their claims of infringement of these intellectual
property rights are successful, they may be entitled to
damages and Philips could incur a fine.
Any damage to Philips’ reputation could have an
adverse effect on its businesses and brand.
Philips is exposed to developments which could affect
its reputation. Such developments could be of an
environmental or social nature, connected to the
behavior of individual employees or suppliers, or could
relate to adherence to regulations related to labor,
human rights, health and safety, environmental and
chemical management. Reputational damage could
materially impact Philips’ brand value, financial
condition and operating results.

6.5 Compliance risks
Philips is exposed to non-compliance with product
safety laws, good manufacturing practices and data
privacy.
Philips’ brand image and reputation would be
adversely impacted by non-compliance with various
product safety laws, good manufacturing practices and
data protection. In light of Philips’ digital strategy, data
privacy laws are increasingly important. Also, Diagnosis
& Treatment and Connected Care & Health Informatics
are subject to various (patient) data protection and
safety laws. In Diagnosis & Treatment and Connected
Care & Health Informatics, privacy and product safety
and security issues may arise, especially with respect to
remote access or monitoring of patient data or loss of
data on our customers’ systems. Philips is exposed to
the risk that its products, including components or
materials procured from suppliers, may prove to be not
compliant with safety laws, e.g. chemical safety
regulations. Such non-compliance could result in a ban
on the sale or use of these products.
Philips operates in a highly regulated product safety
and quality environment. Philips’ products are subject
to regulation (e.g. the new EU Medical Devices
Regulation) by various government agencies, including
the FDA (US) and comparable foreign agencies (e.g.
CFDA China, MHRA UK, ASNM France, BfArM Germany,
IGZ Netherlands). Obtaining their approval is costly and
time consuming, but a prerequisite for introducing

66

Annual Report 2017

products in the market. A delay or inability to obtain the
necessary regulatory approvals for new products could
have a material adverse effect on business. The risk
exists that product safety incidents or user concerns
could trigger FDA business reviews which, if failed,
could lead to business interruption which in turn could
adversely affect Philips’ financial condition and
operating results.
Philips’ global presence exposes the company to
regional and local regulatory rules, changes to which
may affect the realization of business opportunities and
investments in the countries in which Philips operates.
Philips has established subsidiaries in over 80
countries. These subsidiaries are exposed to changes in
governmental regulations and unfavorable political
developments, which may affect the realization of
business opportunities or impair Philips’ local
investments. Philips’ increased focus on the healthcare
sector increases its exposure to highly regulated
markets, where obtaining clearances or approvals for
new products is of great importance, and where there
is a dependency on the available funding for healthcare
systems. In addition, changes in government
reimbursement policies may affect spending on
healthcare.
Philips is exposed to governmental investigations and
legal proceedings with regard to possible anticompetitive market practices.
National and European authorities are focused on
possible anti-competitive market practices. Philips’
financial position and results could be materially
affected by an adverse final outcome of governmental
investigations and litigation, as well as any potential
related claims. In the past Philips has been subject to
such investigations, litigation and related claims. See
also note 24, Contingent assets and liabilities.
Legal proceedings covering a range of matters are
pending in various jurisdictions against Philips and its
current and former group companies. Due to the
uncertainty inherent in legal proceedings, it is difficult
to predict the final outcome.
Philips, including a certain number of its current and
former group companies, is involved in legal
proceedings relating to such matters as competition
issues, commercial transactions, product liability,
participations and environmental pollution. Since the
ultimate outcome of asserted claims and proceedings,
or the impact of any claims that may be asserted in the
future, cannot be predicted with certainty, Philips’
financial position and results of operations could be
affected materially by adverse outcomes.
Please refer to note 24, Contingent assets and
liabilities, for additional disclosure relating to specific
legal proceedings.

Risk management 6.5

Philips is exposed to non-compliance with business
conduct rules and regulations.
Philips’ attempts to realize its growth ambitions could
expose it to the risk of non-compliance with business
conduct rules and regulations, such as anti-bribery
provisions. This risk is heightened in growth
geographies as the legal and regulatory environment is
less developed in growth geographies compared to
mature geographies. Examples include commission
payments to third parties, remuneration payments to
agents, distributors, consultants and the like, and the
acceptance of gifts, which may be considered in some
markets to be normal local business practice.
Defective internal controls would adversely affect our
financial reporting and management process.
The reliability of reporting is important in ensuring that
management decisions for steering the businesses and
managing both top-line and bottom-line growth are
based on reliable data. Flaws in internal control
systems could adversely affect the financial position
and results and hamper expected growth.
Accurate disclosures provide investors and other
market professionals with significant information for a
better understanding of Philips’ businesses.
Imperfections or lack of clarity in disclosures could
create market uncertainty regarding the reliability of the
data presented and could have a negative impact on
the Philips share price.
The reliability of revenue and expenditure data is key
for steering the business and for managing top-line and
bottom-line growth. The long lifecycle of healthcare
sales, from order acceptance to accepted installation,
together with the complexity of the accounting rules for
when revenue can be recognized in the accounts,
presents a challenge in terms of ensuring there is
consistency of application of the accounting rules
throughout Philips’ global business.

6.6 Financial risks
Philips is exposed to a variety of treasury risks and other
financial risks including liquidity risk, currency risk,
interest rate risk, commodity price risk, credit risk,
country risk and other insurable risk.
Negative developments impacting the liquidity of
global capital markets could affect the ability of Philips
to raise or re-finance debt in the capital markets or
could lead to significant increases in the cost of such
borrowing in the future. If the markets expect a
downgrade or downgrades by the rating agencies or if
such a downgrade has actually taken place, this could
increase the cost of borrowing, reduce our potential
investor base and adversely affect our business.
Philips operates in over 100 countries and its earnings
and equity are therefore inevitably exposed to
fluctuations in exchange rates of foreign currencies

against the euro. Philips’ sales are sensitive in particular
to movements in the US dollar, Japanese yen and a
wide range of other currencies from developed and
emerging markets. Philips’ sourcing and manufacturing
spend is concentrated in the Eurozone, United States
and China. Income from operations is particularly
sensitive to movements in currencies from countries
where the Group has no manufacturing/sourcing
activities or only has manufacturing/sourcing activities
on a small scale such as Japan, Canada, Australia and
Great Britain and in a range of emerging markets such
as Russia, Korea, Indonesia, India and Brazil.
The credit risk of financial and non-financial
counterparties with outstanding payment obligations
creates exposures for Philips, particularly in relation to
accounts receivable with customers and liquid assets
and fair values of derivatives and insurance receivables
contracts with financial counterparties. A default by
counterparties in such transactions can have a material
adverse effect on Philips’ financial condition and
operating results.
Philips is exposed to interest rate risk, particularly in
relation to its long-term debt position; this risk can take
the form of either fair value or cash flow risk. Failure to
effectively hedge this risk can impact Philips’ financial
condition and operating results.
For further analysis, please refer to note 29, Details of
treasury / other financial risks.
Philips is exposed to tax risks, which could have a
significant adverse financial impact.
Philips is exposed to tax risks, which could result in
double taxation, penalties and interest payments. The
source of the risks could lie in local tax rules and
regulations as well as in the international and EU
regulatory frameworks. These include transfer pricing
risks on internal cross-border deliveries of goods and
services, tax risks related to acquisitions and
divestments, tax risks related to permanent
establishments, tax risks relating to tax loss, interest
and tax credits carried forward and potential changes
in tax law that could result in higher tax expenses and
payments. The risks may have a significant impact on
local financial tax results which in turn could adversely
affect Philips’ financial condition and operating results.
The value of the deferred tax assets such as tax losses
carried forward is subject to availability of sufficient
taxable income within the tax loss-carry-forward
period, but also availability of sufficient taxable income
within the foreseeable future in the case of tax losses
carried forward with an indefinite carry-forward period.
The ultimate realization of the Company’s deferred tax
assets, including tax losses and tax credits carried
forward, is dependent upon the generation of future
taxable income in the countries where the temporary
differences, unused tax losses and unused tax credits
were incurred and upon periods during which the

Annual Report 2017

67

Risk management 6.6

deferred tax assets become deductible. Additionally, in
certain instances, realization of such deferred tax
assets is dependent upon the successful execution of
tax planning strategies. Accordingly, there can be no
absolute assurance that all deferred tax assets, such as
(net) tax losses and credits carried forward, will be
realized.
The US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December
2017 has both positive and negative consequences for
Philips. Philips has significant tax assets and liabilities
in the US as it is an important market for Philips with
substantial sales, manufacturing sites and material
acquisitions during the past few years. The US Tax Cuts
and Jobs Act introduced complex new rules, and
further clarifications and guidance by the US authorities
are anticipated. These could have a significant financial
impact for which Philips will continue monitoring and
analyzing any updated guidance.
For further details, please refer to the tax risks
paragraph in note 8, Income taxes.
Philips has defined-benefit pension plans and other
post-retirement plans in a number of countries. The
funded status and the cost of maintaining these plans
are influenced by movements in financial market and
demographic developments, creating volatility in
Philips’ financials.
A significant proportion of (former) employees in
Europe and North and Latin America is covered by
defined-benefit pension plans and other postretirement plans. The accounting for such plans
requires management to make estimates on
assumptions such as discount rates, inflation, longevity,
expected cost of medical care and expected rates of
compensation. Movements (e.g. due to the movements
of financial markets) in these assumptions can have a
significant impact on the Defined Benefit Obligation
and net interest cost. A negative performance of the
financial markets could have a material impact on cash
funding requirements and net interest cost and also
affect the value of certain financial assets and liabilities
of the company.
Philips is exposed to uncertainty on the timing and
proceeds of a sale of Philips Lighting
In 2016, Philips separated its Lighting business and on
May 27, 2016, Philips Lighting was listed on the
Amsterdam Stock Exchange. Since then Philips Lighting
operates as a separate listed company. Philips has
subsequently sold a substantial part of its ownership in
Philips Lighting and deconsolidated Philips Lighting in
2017. Philips’ overall objective is to fully divest its
ownership of Philips Lighting. The nature or form, timing
and the level of proceeds from this divestment process
are uncertain. The timing and level of proceeds will
depend on general market conditions and investor
appetite for companies of this size and nature. Philips
no longer has control over Philips Lighting and has

68

Annual Report 2017

deconsolidated the assets, liabilities and financial
results of Philips Lighting. While Philips holds Philips
Lighting as an asset held for sale, Philips’ earnings will
be affected by changes in the fair value of Philips
Lighting.
Philips is exposed to a number of financial reporting
risks, i.e. the risk of material misstatements or errors in
its financial reporting.
A risk rating is assigned for each risk identified, based
on the likelihood of occurrence and the potential
impact of the risk on the financial statements and
related disclosures. In determining the probability that
a risk will result in a misstatement of a more than
inconsequential amount or of a material nature, the
following factors are considered to be critical:
complexity of the associated accounting activity or
transaction process, history of accounting and
reporting errors, likelihood of significant (contingent)
liabilities arising from activities, exposure to losses,
existence of a related party transaction, volume of
activity and homogeneity of the individual transactions
processed, and changes in accounting characteristics in
the prior period compared to the period before that.
For important critical reporting risk areas identified
within Philips we refer to the “Use of estimates” section
in note 1, Significant accounting policies, as the
Company assessed that reporting risk is closely related
to the use of estimates and application of judgment.

9 Supervisory Board report
“ The Supervisory Board is committed to its role to oversee
the overall performance, transformation and corporate
governance of Philips as well as the execution of its
strategy.” Jeroen van der Veer, Chairman of the Supervisory Board
Introduction
The Supervisory Board supervises and advises the
Board of Management and Executive Committee in
performing their management tasks and setting the
direction of the business of the Philips Group. The
Supervisory Board acts, and we as individual members
of the Board act, in the interests of Koninklijke Philips
N.V., its businesses and all its stakeholders. This report
includes a more speciﬁc description of the Supervisory
Board’s activities during the ﬁnancial year 2017 and
other relevant information on its functioning.

Activities of the Supervisory Board
The overview below indicates a number of matters that
we reviewed and/or discussed during meetings
throughout 2017:
• The annual review of the Company’s strategy.
Building on the strategy that was presented in 2016,
this year’s strategy review focused on the progress
made in the execution of the strategy by business
and market, the key strategic thrusts, the path-tovalue and an update on the M&A and partnership
roadmap. The Supervisory Board also reviewed the
priorities to deliver on the Company’s financial
ambition, to improve productivity, boost growth in
core businesses, better serve customers and win in
solutions along the health continuum.
• The performance of the Philips Group and its
underlying businesses and flexibility, under its capital
structure and credit ratings, to pay dividends and to
fund capital investments, including share
repurchases and other financial initiatives;
• Philips’ annual management commitment and

a range of topics including:
• The strategy and performance of Philips North
America and China, including market developments,
business performance and key strategic initiatives.
• The solutions and partnership approach of Philips,
including the go-to-market strategy of selected
solutions and milestone planning.

Supervisory Board meetings and attendance
In 2017, the members of the Supervisory Board
convened for eight regular meetings and one
extraordinary meeting. Moreover, we collectively and
individually interacted with members of the Executive
Committee and with senior management outside the
formal Supervisory Board meetings. The Chairman of
the Supervisory Board and the CEO met regularly for
bilateral discussions about the progress of the
Company on a variety of matters. The Supervisory
Board also held bilateral meetings with several
members of the Executive Committee to discuss R&D
programs, internal audit, and financial and internal
controls.
The Supervisory Board meetings were well attended in
2017. All Supervisory Board members were present
during the Supervisory Board meetings in 2017, with the
exception of one member, who was unable to attend
the January Supervisory Board meeting. The
Supervisory Board visited the Company’s
manufacturing facilities in Bothell, USA, to meet with
local and regional management and toured the site to
view demonstrations of the latest innovations in the
area of Emergency Care and Resuscitation, Oral
Healthcare and Ultrasound and meet with employees.
The Supervisory Board also visited the Company’s
research facilities in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, and
met with various executives from Philips Research and
Design. The committees of the Supervisory Board also
convened regularly (see the separate reports of the
committees below) and all of the committees reported
back on their activities to the full Supervisory Board. In
addition to the formal meetings of the Board and its
Committees, the Board members also held private
meetings. We, as members of the Board, devoted
sufficient time to engage (proactively if the
circumstances so required) in our supervisory
responsibilities.

Composition, diversity and self-evaluation
by the Supervisory Board
The Supervisory Board is a separate corporate body
that is independent of the Board of Management (and
the Executive Committee). Its independent character is
also reﬂected in the requirement that members of the
Supervisory Board can be neither a member of the
Board of Management nor an employee of the
Company. The Supervisory Board considers all its
members to be independent pursuant to the Dutch
Corporate Governance Code.
The Supervisory Board currently consists of seven
members. In 2017, there were no changes to the
membership of the Board. Jeroen van der Veer and
Christine Poon were re-appointed as members of the
Supervisory Board, each for an additional term of four
years. The agenda for the upcoming 2018 Annual
General Meeting of Shareholders will include a
proposal to re-appoint Orit Gadiesh as member of the
Supervisory Board for an additional term of four years.

Annual Report 2017

The Supervisory Board pays great value to diversity in
its composition and it adopted a Diversity Policy for the
Supervisory Board, the Board of Management and the
Executive Committee, effective December 31, 2017 (see
the Corporate Governance and Nomination and
Selection Committee report for further details). As laid
down in the Diversity Policy, the aim is that the
Supervisory Board (and the Board of Management and
the Executive Committee) comprise members with a
European and a non-European background
(nationality, working experience or otherwise) and
overall at least four different nationalities, and that they
comprise at least 30% male and at least 30% female
members. The Supervisory Board’s composition
furthermore follows the profile as included in the Rules
of Procedure of the Supervisory Board, which aims for
an appropriate combination of knowledge and
experience among its members encompassing
marketing, manufacturing, technology, healthcare,
financial, economic, social and legal aspects of
international business and government and public
administration in relation to the global and
multiproduct character of Philips’ businesses. The aim
is also to have one or more members with an executive
or similar position in business or society no longer than
5 years ago. The composition of the Supervisory Board
shall be in accordance with the best practice provisions
on independence of the Dutch Corporate Governance
Code and each member of the Supervisory Board shall
be capable of assessing the broad outline of the overall
policy of the Company. The size of the Supervisory
Board may vary as considered appropriate to support
its profile.
Currently, the composition of the Supervisory Board
meets the abovementioned gender diversity targets.
We note that there may be various pragmatic reasons
– such as other relevant selection criteria and the
availability of suitable candidates – that could play a
role in the achievement of our diversity targets.
The Supervisory Board has spent time throughout 2017
considering its composition and it will continue to
devote attention to this topic during 2018.
In 2017, each member of the Supervisory Board
completed a questionnaire to verify compliance with
the applicable corporate governance rules and its own
Rules of Procedure. The outcome of this survey was
satisfactory.
In addition, we each submitted to the Chairman
responses to a questionnaire designed to self-evaluate
the functioning of the Supervisory Board. The
questionnaire covered topics such as the composition
and competence of the Supervisory Board (for
example, the Board’s size and the education and
training requirements of its members), access to
information, the frequency and quality of the meetings,
quality and timeliness of the meeting materials, the
nature of the topics discussed during meetings and the
functioning of the Supervisory Board’s committees. The

Supervisory Board report 9

responses to the questionnaire were aggregated into a
report and discussed by the Supervisory Board in a
private meeting and by the committees. Areas of
improvement were discussed, for example ensuring
there is sufficient time for discussion and challenge in
meetings, which will be followed up by the Chairman.
Members of the Supervisory Board also had a “one-toone” discussion with the Chairman, and the Chairman
was evaluated by the Vice-Chairman. The responses
provided by the Supervisory Board members indicated

that the Board continues to be a well-functioning team.
The functioning of the Supervisory Board committees
was considered to be commendable and specific
feedback was addressed by the Chairman of each
committee with its members.
The periodic use of an external evaluator to measure
the functioning of the Supervisory Board was also
considered. The Supervisory Board intends to use an
external evaluator in 2018.

Supervisory Board committees

Further information

The Supervisory Board has assigned certain of its tasks
to the three long-standing committees, also referred to
in the Dutch Corporate Governance Code: the
Corporate Governance and Nomination & Selection
Committee, the Remuneration Committee and the
Audit Committee. In 2015, the Supervisory Board also
established the Quality & Regulatory Committee. The
separate reports of these committees are part of this
Supervisory Board report and are published below.

To gain a better understanding of the responsibilities of
the Supervisory Board and the internal regulations and
procedures governing its functioning and that of its
committees, please refer to chapter 10, Corporate
governance, of this Annual Report and to the following
documents published on the Company’s website:

The function of all of the Board’s committees is to
prepare the decision-making of the full Supervisory
Board, and the committees currently have no
independent or assigned powers. The full Board retains
overall responsibility for the activities of its committees.

Financial Statements 2017
The financial statements of the Company for 2017, as
presented by the Board of Management, have been
audited by Ernst & Young Accountants LLP, the
independent external auditor appointed by the General
Meeting of Shareholders. Its reports have been
included in section 12.5, Independent auditor’s report,
of this Annual Report. We have approved these
financial statements, and all individual members of the
Supervisory Board (together with the members of the
Board of Management) have signed these documents.
We recommend to shareholders that they adopt the
2017 financial statements. We likewise recommend to
shareholders that they adopt the proposal of the Board
of Management to make a distribution of [EUR 0.80 per
common share (up to EUR 750 million if all shareholders
would elect cash), in cash or in shares at the option of
the shareholder, against the net income for 2017.
Finally, we would like to express our thanks to the
members of the Executive Committee and all other
employees for their continued contribution during the
year.

9.1 Report of the Corporate Governance
and Nomination & Selection
Committee
The Corporate Governance and Nomination & Selection
Committee is chaired by Jeroen van der Veer and its
other members are Christine Poon and Heino von
Prondzynski. The Committee is responsible for the
review of selection criteria and appointment
procedures for the Board of Management, the
Executive Committee, certain other key management
positions, as well as the Supervisory Board.
In 2017, the Committee met five times. All Committee
members were present during these meetings.
The Committee devoted time on the appointment or
reappointment of candidates to fill current and future
vacancies on the Supervisory Board, Board of
Management and Executive Committee.
Following those consultations it prepared decisions
and advised the Supervisory Board on candidates for
appointment. This resulted in the proposal to reappoint, at the upcoming 2018 Annual General Meeting
of Shareholders, Orit Gadiesh as member of the
Supervisory Board.
Under its responsibility for the selection criteria and
appointment procedures for Philips’ senior
management, the Committee reviewed the functioning
of the Board of Management and its individual
members, the Executive Committee succession plans
and emergency candidates for key roles in the
Company. The conclusions from these reviews were
taken into account in the performance evaluation of the
Board of Management and Executive Committee
members1) and the selection of succession candidates.
In 2017, the Committee reviewed and approved the
changes in the Executive Committee.
The Committee also discussed the succession of Pieter
Nota, member of Philips’ Board of Management, who
left the Company per October 31, 2017. Marnix van
Ginneken, member of the Executive Committee, was
appointed as member of the Board of Management
with effect from November 1, 2017.
With respect to corporate governance matters, the
Committee discussed relevant developments and
legislative changes, including the revised Dutch
Corporate Governance code, the EU Directive on
disclosure of non-financial information and diversity
and the EU Directive on Shareholders Rights.

Diversity
As indicated in its report above, the Supervisory Board
adopted a Diversity Policy for the Supervisory Board,
the Board of Management and the Executive
Committee, effective December 31, 2017, which is
published on the Company website.

The criteria in the Diversity Policy aim to ensure that the
Supervisory Board, the Board of Management and the
Executive Committee have a sufficient diversity of views
and the expertise needed for a good understanding of
current affairs and longer-term risks and opportunities
related to the Company’s business. The nature and
complexity of the Company’s business is taken into
account when assessing optimal board diversity, as
well as the social and environmental context in which
the Company operates.
Pursuant to the Diversity Policy, the selection of
candidates for appointment to the Supervisory Board,
the Board of Management and the Executive
Committee will be based on merit. It is also noted that
the Executive Committee comprises of the members of
the Board of Management and certain key officers from
functions, businesses and markets. With due regard to
the above, the Company shall seek to fill vacancies by
considering candidates that bring a diversity of
(amongst others) age, gender and educational and
professional backgrounds.
The Supervisory Board’s aim is that the Supervisory
Board, the Board of Management and the Executive
Committee comprise members with a European and a
non-European background (nationality, working
experience or otherwise) and overall at least four
different nationalities, and that they comprise at least
30% male and at least 30% female members.
Currently, the composition of the Board of
Management and Executive Committee does not yet
meet the abovementioned gender diversity targets.
More than 25% (5 out of 19) of the positions to which
the Diversity Policy applies (Supervisory Board and
Executive Committee/Board of Management) are held
by women. As indicated in the Supervisory Board
report, there may be a variety of pragmatic reasons –
such as other relevant selection criteria and the
availability of suitable candidates – that play a role in
the achievement of our diversity targets. The Company
has put in place several measures to enhance diversity.
In 2016, the Company set a renewed intention for
inclusion & diversity as we pivoted to become a health
technology company. Philips launched an inaugural
Executive Inclusion and Diversity Committee and reestablished the Women’s Leadership Council, a council
of female executives collaborating together to build an
inclusive culture. In 2017, Philips is continuing with this
approach and building upon it with establishing a 2020
gender target and succession planning and considering
additional programs such as launching unconscious
bias training and creating a formal mentoring program.
Philips’ commitment towards inclusion and diversity is
furthermore reflected in the company-wide Inclusion
and Diversity Policy, the General Business Principles
and Fair Employment Policy.
The Committee continues to give appropriate weight to
diversity in the nomination and appointment process
for future vacancies, while taking into account the

overall profile and selection criteria for the
appointments of suitable candidates to the Supervisory
Board, Board of Management and Executive
Committee.

Reference is made to sub-section 9.2.7, 2017 Annual Incentive, of this
Annual Report, setting out the performance review of the Board of
Management and Executive Committee members by the Remuneration
Committee

9.2 Report of the Remuneration
Committee
Introduction
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Heino von
Prondzynski. Its other members are Jeroen van der Veer
and Christine Poon. The Committee is responsible for
preparing decisions of the Supervisory Board on the
remuneration of individual members of the Board of
Management and the Executive Committee. In
performing its duties and responsibilities the
Remuneration Committee is assisted by an external
consultant and in-house remuneration expert acting on
the basis of a protocol which ensures that they act on
the instructions of the Remuneration Committee.
Currently, no member of the Remuneration Committee
is a member of the management board of another listed
company. In line with applicable statutory and other
regulations, this report focuses on the terms of
engagement and remuneration of the members of the
Board of Management. The Committee met six times in
2017. All Committee members were present during
these meetings, with the exception of Ms. Poon, who
was unable to attend the February meeting.

9.2.1 Remuneration policy
The objectives of the remuneration policy for members
of the Board of Management, as adopted by the
General Meeting of Shareholders in 2017, are in line with
that for executives throughout the Philips Group. That
is, to focus them on improving the performance of the
company and enhancing the long-term value of the
Philips Group, to motivate and retain them, and to be
able to attract other highly qualified executives to enter
into Philips’ services, when required.
In order to compete for talent in the health technology
market, the Supervisory Board identified a new peer
group1) for remuneration benchmarking purposes in
2017 to align the Board of Management’s remuneration
levels closer to equivalent positions in this market.
These peer companies are either business competitors,
with an emphasis on companies in the healthcare,
technology related or consumer products area, or
companies we compete with for executive talent. These
consist of predominantly Dutch and other European
companies, plus a minority number (up to 25%) of US
based global companies, of comparable size,
complexity and international scope. Annual changes to
the peer group can be made by the Supervisory Board,

1)

76

for example for reasons of changes in business or
competitive nature of the companies involved. Such
change will be disclosed if it has a substantial impact
on peer group composition. No changes were made to
the peer group during the remainder of 2017.
To support the policy’s objectives, the remuneration
package includes a significant variable part in the form
of an annual cash bonus incentive and long-term
incentive in the form of performance shares. The policy
does not encourage inappropriate risk-taking.
The performance targets for the members of the Board
of Management are determined annually at the
beginning of the year. The Supervisory Board
determines whether performance conditions have
been met and can adjust the payout of the annual cash
bonus incentive and the long-term incentive grant
upward or downward if the predetermined
performance criteria were to produce an inappropriate
result in extraordinary circumstances. The authority for
such adjustments exists on the basis of contractual
ultimum-remedium and claw-back clauses. In addition,
pursuant to Dutch legislation effective January 1, 2014,
incentives may, under certain circumstances, be
amended or clawed back pursuant to statutory powers.
For more information please refer to chapter 10,
Corporate governance, of this Annual Report. Further
information on the performance targets is given in the
chapters on the Annual Incentive (see sub-section
9.2.7, 2017 Annual Incentive, of this Annual Report) and
the Long-Term Incentive Plan (see sub-section 9.2.8,
2017 Long-Term Incentive Plan, of this Annual Report)
respectively.

9.2.2 Services agreements
Below, the main elements of the services agreements
(“overeenkomst van opdracht”) of the members of the
Board of Management are included.

Term of appointment
The members of the Board of Management are
engaged for a period of 4 years, it being understood
that this period expires no later than at the end of the
following AGM held in the fourth year after the year of
appointment.

Notice period
Termination of the contract for the provision of services
is subject to six months’ notice for both parties.

Severance payment
The severance payment is set at a maximum of one
year’s annual base compensation. In case of Mr Nota,
who left the company during 2017, no severance
payment was made.

Share ownership
Simultaneously with the approval of the revised LongTerm Incentive Plan (LTI) in 2017, the guideline for
members of the Board of Management to hold a certain
number of shares in the Company was increased to the
level of at least 300% of annual base compensation
(400% for the CEO). Until this level has been reached
the members of the Board of Management are required
to retain all after-tax shares derived from any long-term
incentive plan.

9.2.3 Scenario analysis
The Remuneration Committee conducts a scenario
analysis annually. This includes the calculation of
remuneration under different scenarios, whereby
different Philips performance assumptions and
corporate actions are examined. The Supervisory Board
concluded that the current policy has proven to
function well in terms of a relationship between the
strategic objectives and the chosen performance
criteria and believes that the Annual and Long-Term
Incentive Plans support this relationship.

9.2.4 2017 Internal pay ratios
In line with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code,
internal pay ratios are an important input for
determining the Remuneration Policy for the Board of
Management.
The ratio between the annual total compensation for
the CEO2) and the average annual total compensation
for an employee3) was 56:1 for the 2017 financial year.
Both annual total compensation figures include
pension benefits. The development of this ratio will be
monitored and disclosed going forward.

9.2.5 Remuneration costs
The following table gives an overview of the costs
incurred by the Company in the financial year in relation
to the remuneration of the Board of Management. Costs
related to performance shares and restricted share right
grants are taken by the Company over a number of
years. As a consequence, the costs mentioned below in
the performance shares and restricted share rights
columns are the accounting cost of multi-year LongTerm Incentive grants given to members of the Board
of Management.
Note that Pieter Nota was succeeded as a member of
the Board of Management by Marnix van Ginneken as
per November 1, 2017. Hence, details on his
remuneration costs are reported in note 27, Information
on remuneration.

Frans van Houten has reached the required share
ownership level. Abhijit Bhattacharya and Marnix van
Ginneken are at 85% and 61% of their target,
respectively (i.e., 255% and 182% of annual base
compensation, respectively).

2)
3)

Based on total CEO compensation costs (EUR 5,101,429) as reported in note 27, Information on remuneration.
Based on Employee benefit expenses (EUR 5,824 million) divided by the average number of employees (63,798 FTE) as
reported in note 6, Income from operations. This results in an average annual total compensation cost of EUR 91,288.

9.2.6 Annual base compensation
The annual compensation of the members of the Board
of Management has been reviewed in April 2017 as part
of the regular remuneration review. The annual
compensation of Abhijit Bhattacharya has been
increased per April 1, 2017, from EUR 650,000 to EUR
700,000. The increase was made to move the total
compensation level closer to market levels, as well as
to reflect internal relativities. The annual compensation
of Frans van Houten remained unchanged at EUR
1,205,000. The annual compensation for Marnix van
Ginneken, who was appointed to the Board of
Management as per November 1, 2017, was set at EUR
550,000.

9.2.7 2017 Annual Incentive
Each year, a variable Annual Incentive can be earned
based on the achievement of specific targets as
determined by the Supervisory Board at the beginning
of the year. These targets are set at challenging levels
and are partly linked to the results of the company (80%
weighting) and partly to the contribution of the
individual member (20% weighting). The latter includes,
among others, targets as part of our sustainability
program.
The on-target Annual Incentive percentage in 2017 is
set at 80% of the annual base compensation for the
CEO and at 60% of the annual base compensation for
the other members of the Board of Management. The
maximum Annual Incentive achievable is 160% of the
annual base compensation for the CEO and 120% of the
annual base compensation for the other members of
the Board of Management.
To support the performance culture, the financial
targets we set are at Group level for all members of the
Board of Management. The 2017 payouts, shown in the
following table, reflect the above target performance
on two out of three metrics (i.e., EBITA1) and cash flow
based metric) at Group level that apply to Board of
Management. The performance on the comparable
sales growth1) metric was at target.

9.2.8 2017 Long-Term Incentive Plan
Since 2013, the LTI Plan applicable to the members of
the Board of Management consists of performance
shares only. The current long-term incentive plan was
approved by the General Meeting of Shareholders in
2017.

Grant size
The annual grant size is set by reference to a multiple
of base compensation. For the CEO the annual grant
size in 2017 is set at 200% of base compensation and
for the other members of the Board of Management at
150% of base compensation. The actual number of
performance shares to be awarded is determined by
reference to the average of the closing price of the
Royal Philips share on the day of publication of the first
quarterly results and the four subsequent trading days.

Vesting schedule
Dependent upon the achievement of the performance
conditions, cliff-vesting applies three years after the
date of grant. During the vesting period, the value of
dividends will be added to the performance shares in
the form of shares. These dividend-equivalent shares
will only be delivered to the extent that the award
actually vests.

Performance conditions
Vesting of the performance shares is based on two
equally weighted performance conditions:
• 50% Adjusted Earnings per Share growth (“EPS”) and
• 50% Relative Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”)

Non-IFRS financial measure. For the definition and reconciliation to the most directly comparable IFRS measure,
refer to chapter 5, Reconciliation of non-IFRS information, of this Annual Report.

Annual Report 2017

Supervisory Board report 9.2.8

EPS
EPS growth is calculated by applying the simple pointto-point method at year end. Earnings are the income
from continued operations attributable to
shareholders, as reported in the Annual Report. To
eliminate the impact of any share buyback, stock
dividend etcetera, the number of shares to be used for
the purpose of the EPS realization will be the number
of common shares outstanding (after deduction of
treasury shares) on the day prior to the beginning of the
performance period.
Earnings are adjusted for changes in accounting
principles during the performance period. The
Supervisory Board has discretion to include other
adjustments, for example, to account for events that
were not planned when targets were set or were
outside management’s control (e.g., impairments,
restructuring activities, pension items, M&A
transactions and costs and currency fluctuations).
The following performance-incentive zone applies for
EPS:

The peer companies together reflect the business
portfolio of Philips. TSR scores are calculated by taking
an averaging period prior to the start and end of the 3year performance period. The performance incentive
pay-out zone is outlined in the following table, which
results in zero vesting for performance below the 40th
percentile and 200% vesting for performance levels
above the 75th percentile. The incentive zone range has
been constructed such that the average pay-out over
time is expected to be approximately 100%.

Realization of 2015 performance share grant
The 3-year performance period of the 2015
performance share grant ended on December 31, 2017.
The payout results are governed by the former 2013 LTI
Plan and are explained below.
TSR (50% weighting)
Following Medtronic’s acquisition of Covidien
(completed January 2015) and Johnson Controls
merger with Tyco International (completed September
2016), the Supervisory Board adopted the approach of
recognizing Covidien’s and Johnson Controls
performance through the delisting and merger date,
respectively. As a proxy for future performance,
reinvestment in an index of the remaining 19 peer
companies was assumed (effectively retaining a peer
group of 21 companies).
The TSR achieved by Philips during the performance
period was 60.44%. This positioned Philips between
the 3rd and 4th ranked company in the peer group
shown in the following table, resulting in an
achievement of 200%.

Corporate governance of the Philips Group Introduction
Koninklijke Philips N.V., a company organized under
Dutch law, is the parent company of the Philips Group.
The Company, which started as a limited partnership
with the name Philips & Co in Eindhoven, the
Netherlands, in 1891, was converted into the
company with limited liability N.V. Philips’
Gloeilampenfabrieken on September 11, 1912. The
Company’s name was changed to Philips Electronics
N.V. on May 6, 1994, to Koninklijke Philips Electronics
N.V. on April 1, 1998, and to Koninklijke Philips N.V. on
May 15, 2013. Its shares have been listed on the
Amsterdam Stock Exchange, Euronext Amsterdam,
since 1912. The shares have been traded in the United
States since 1962 and have been listed on the New York
Stock Exchange since 1987.
Over the last decades the Company has pursued a
consistent policy to improve its corporate governance
in line with Dutch, US and international (Dutch
Corporate Governance Codes of) best practices. The
Company has worked to incorporate a fair disclosure
practice in its investor relations policy, strengthen the
accountability of its executive management and the
(independent) members of its Supervisory Board, and
respect and enhance the rights and powers of
shareholders and raise the level of communication with
investors. The Company is required to comply with,
inter alia, Dutch corporate governance rules, the US
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, other US securities laws and
related regulations (including applicable stock
exchange rules), insofar as applicable to the Company.
A summary of significant differences between the
Company’s corporate governance practice and the
New York Stock Exchange corporate governance
standards is published on the Company’s website
(www.philips.com/investor).
In this report, the Company addresses its overall
corporate governance structure and states to what
extent and how it applies the principles and best
practice provisions of the Dutch Corporate Governance
Code. The current Code is dated December 8, 2016
replacing the former 2008 Dutch Corporate
Governance Code. Where the principles or best practice
of the new Code required changes to rules, policies,
procedures or other written records, such changes have
been implemented at the end of 2017. This report also
includes the information which the Company is
required to disclose pursuant to the Dutch
governmental Decree on Article 10 Takeover Directive
and the governmental Decree on Corporate
Governance. Deviations from aspects of the corporate
governance structure of the Company, when deemed
necessary in the interests of the Company, will be
disclosed in this corporate governance report.

Annual Report 2017

Substantial changes in the Company’s corporate
governance structure and in the Company’s
compliance with the Dutch Corporate Governance
Code, if any, will be submitted to the General Meeting
of Shareholders for discussion under a separate
agenda item. The Supervisory Board and the Board of
Management, which are responsible for the corporate
governance structure of the Company, are of the
opinion that the principles and best practice provisions
of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code that are
addressed to the Board of Management and the
Supervisory Board are being applied.

Corporate governance 10.1

10.1 Board of Management and
Executive Committee
Introduction
The Board of Management is entrusted with the
management of the Company. Certain key officers have
been appointed to manage the Company together with
the Board of Management, allowing functions,
businesses and markets to be represented at the
highest levels in the company. The members of the
Board of Management and these key officers together
constitute the Executive Committee. The Executive
Committee has, for practical purposes, adopted a
division of responsibilities indicating the functional and
business areas monitored and reviewed by the
individual members. For the purpose of this corporate
governance report, where the Executive Committee is
mentioned this also includes the Board of Management
unless the context requires otherwise.
Under the chairmanship of the President/Chief
Executive Officer (CEO), the members of the Executive
Committee drive the Company’s management agenda
and share responsibility for the continuity of the Philips
Group, focusing on long-term value creation and taking
into account the interests of shareholders and other
stakeholders. For a description of further
responsibilities and tasks of the Executive Committee
please refer to the Rules of Procedure of the Board of
Management and the Executive Committee which are
published on the Company’s website.
In compliance with the Dutch Corporate Governance
Code, the Annual Report addresses the strategy and
culture of Philips aimed at long-term value creation.
The strategy of Philips is described in more detail in
chapter 2, Our strategic focus, of this Annual Report.
Here, reference is also made to the Philips Business
System, a collection of best practices and global
processes that provide a framework for continuous
improvement and operational excellence, with the aim
of delivering on the Company’s mission and vision and
ensuring success is repeatable. As set out in section 3.2,
Social performance, of this Annual Report, Philips
promotes a behavior and competency-driven growth
and performance culture, which is anchored by the
integrity norms described in the Philips General
Business Principles (GBP). Chapter 1, Message from the
CEO, of this Annual Report, explains how the
Company’s strategy was executed in 2017; in this
regard, please refer also to chapter 4, Segment
performance, of this Annual Report.
The Board of Management remains accountable for the
actions and decisions of the Executive Committee and
has ultimate responsibility for the Company’s
management and the external reporting and is
answerable to shareholders of the Company at the
Annual General Meeting of Shareholders.

All resolutions of the Executive Committee are adopted
by majority vote comprising the majority of the
members of the Board of Management present or
represented, such majority comprising the vote of the
CEO. The Board of Management retains the authority
to, at all times and in all circumstances, adopt
resolutions without the participation of the other
members of the Executive Committee. In discharging its
duties, the Executive Committee shall be guided by the
interests of the Company and its affiliated enterprise,
taking into consideration the interests of the
Company’s stakeholders.
The Executive Committee is supervised by the
Supervisory Board and shall provide the latter with all
information the Supervisory Board needs to fulfill its
own responsibilities. Major decisions of the Board of
Management and Executive Committee require the
approval of the Supervisory Board; these include
decisions concerning (a) the operational and financial
objectives of the Company, (b) the strategy designed to
achieve the objectives, (c) if necessary, the parameters
to be applied in relation to the strategy and (d)
corporate social responsibility issues that are relevant
to the Company.
The Executive Committee follows the Rules of
Procedure of the Board of Management and Executive
Committee, which set forth procedures for meetings,
resolutions and minutes.

(Term of) Appointment, composition and
conflicts of interests
Members of the Board of Management as well as the
CEO are appointed by the General Meeting of
Shareholders upon a binding recommendation drawn
up by the Supervisory Board after consultation with the
CEO. This binding recommendation may be overruled
by a resolution of the General Meeting of Shareholders
adopted by a simple majority of the votes cast and
representing at least one-third of the issued share
capital. If a simple majority of the votes cast is in favor
of the resolution to overrule the binding
recommendation, but such majority does not represent
at least one-third of the issued share capital, a new
meeting may be convened at which the resolution may
be passed by a simple majority of the votes cast,
regardless of the portion of the issued share capital
represented by such majority. In the event that a
binding recommendation has been overruled, a new
binding recommendation shall be submitted to the
General Meeting of Shareholders. If such second
binding recommendation has been overruled, the
General Meeting of Shareholders shall be free to
appoint a board member.
Members of the Board of Management and the CEO are
appointed for a term of four years, it being understood
that this term expires at the end of the General Meeting
of Shareholders to be held in the fourth year after the
year of their appointment or, if applicable, until a later
retirement date or other contractual termination date in

Annual Report 2017

the fourth year, unless the General Meeting of
Shareholders resolves otherwise. Reappointment is
possible for consecutive terms of four years in
accordance with the proceeding sentence. Members
may be suspended by the Supervisory Board and by
the General Meeting of Shareholders and dismissed by
the latter. Individual data on the members of the Board
of Management and Executive Committee
are published in chapter 7, Management, of this Annual
Report.
The other members of the Executive Committee are
appointed, suspended and dismissed by the CEO,
subject to approval by the Supervisory Board.
Candidates for appointment to the Board of
Management and the Executive Committee will be
selected while taking into account the Company’s
Diversity Policy for the Supervisory Board, the Board of
Management and the Executive Committee (effective
December 31, 2017, and published on the Company’s
website). As also addressed in the Diversity Policy,
Dutch legislation on board diversity provides that the
Company must pursue a policy of having at least 30%
of the seats on the Board of Management held by men
and at least 30% of the seats held by women. For more
details on the Diversity Policy and board diversity
please refer to section 9.1, Report of the Corporate
Governance and Nomination & Selection Committee, of
this Annual Report.
The acceptance by a member of the Board of
Management of a position as a member of a
supervisory board or a position as a non-executive
director in a one-tier board (Non-Executive
Directorship) at another company requires the
approval of the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory
Board is required to be notified of other important
positions (to be) held by a member of the Board of
Management. Dutch legislation provides for certain
limitations on the number of Non-Executive
Directorships a member of the Board of Management
may hold. No such board member shall hold more than
two Non-Executive Directorships at ‘large’ companies
(naamloze vennootschappen or besloten
vennootschappen) or ‘large’ foundations (stichtingen),
as defined under Dutch law, and no member of the
Board of Management shall hold the position of
chairman of another one-tier board or the position of
chairman of another supervisory board. In order for a
company or foundation to be regarded as large, it must
meet at least two of the following criteria: (i) the value
of the assets according to the balance sheet with
explanatory notes, considering the acquisition or
manufacturing price, exceeds EUR 20 million; (ii) the net
turnover exceeds EUR 40 million; or (iii) the average
number of employees equals or exceeds 250. During
the financial year 2017 all members of the Board of
Management complied with the limitations described
above in this paragraph.

86

Annual Report 2017

Dutch legislation on conflicts of interests provides that
a member of the Board of Management may not
participate in the adoption of resolutions if he or she
has a direct or indirect personal conflict of interest with
the Company or related enterprise. If all members of the
Board of Management have a conflict, the resolution
concerned will be considered by the Supervisory Board.
The Company’s corporate governance includes rules to
specify situations in which a (potential) conflict may
exist, to avoid (potential) conflicts of interests as much
as possible, and to deal with such conflicts should they
arise. The rules on conflicts of interests apply to the
other members of the Executive Committee
correspondingly.
Relevant matters relating to conflicts of interests, if any,
shall be mentioned in the Annual Report for the
financial year in question. No such matters have
occurred during the financial year 2017.

Amount and composition of the
remuneration of the Board of Management
The remuneration of the individual members of the
Board of Management is determined by the
Supervisory Board on the proposal of the
Remuneration Committee of the Supervisory Board,
and must be consistent with the policy thereon as
adopted by the General Meeting of Shareholders. The
current remuneration policy applicable to the Board of
Management was adopted by the 2017 Annual General
Meeting of Shareholders, and is published on the
Company’s website. A full and detailed description of
the composition of the remuneration of the individual
members of the Board of Management is included
in section 9.2, Report of the Remuneration Committee,
of this Annual Report.
Pursuant to Dutch legislation, the implementation of
the remuneration policy during the financial year must
be included as a separate agenda item in the convening
notice for a General Meeting of Shareholders and must
be dealt with before the meeting can proceed to
consider and adopt the Annual Accounts.
The current Remuneration Policy applicable to the
Board of Management was adopted at the Annual
General Meeting of Shareholders held in 2017.
Deviations on elements of the remuneration policy in
extraordinary circumstances, when deemed necessary
in the interests of the Company, will be disclosed in the
Annual Report or, in the case of an appointment, in
good time prior to the appointment of the person
concerned.
All members of the Board of Management are engaged
by means of a services agreement (overeenkomst van
opdracht), as Dutch legislation prohibits a member of
the Board of Management from being employed by
means of a contract of employment. In the event of the
appointment or re-appointment of a member of the
Board of Management, the main elements of the
services agreement - including the amount of the fixed

Corporate governance 10.1

base compensation, the structure and amount of the
variable compensation component, any severance
plan, pension arrangements and the general
performance criteria - shall be made public no later
than at the time of issuance of the notice convening the
General Meeting of Shareholders in which a proposal
for (re-)appointment of that member of the Board of
Management has been placed on the agenda. In
compliance with the Dutch Corporate Governance
Code, the term of the services agreement of the
members of the Board of Management is set at four
years and, in the event of termination, severance
payment is limited to a maximum of one year’s base
compensation. From 2003 until 2013, Philips
maintained a Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTI Plan)
consisting of a mix of restricted shares rights and stock
options for members of the Board of Management,
Philips executives and other key employees. Since the
full revision in 2013 of the LTI Plan applicable to
members of the Board of Management, the plan
consists of performance shares only, with cliff-vesting
three years after the date of grant, dependent upon the
achievement of certain performance conditions. For
more details please refer to section 9.2, Report of the
Remuneration Committee, of this Annual Report.
Pursuant to Dutch legislation (effective January 1, 2014),
the Supervisory Board is authorized to change unpaid
bonuses awarded to members of the Board of
Management if payment or delivery of the bonus would
be unacceptable according to the principles of
reasonableness and fairness. The Company, which in
this respect may also be represented by the
Supervisory Board or a special representative
appointed for this purpose by the General Meeting of
Shareholders, may also claim repayment of bonuses
paid or delivered (after December 31, 2013) insofar as
these have been granted on the basis of incorrect
information on the fulfillment of the relevant
performance criteria or other conditions. Bonuses are
broadly defined as ‘non-fixed’ remuneration, either in
cash or in the form of share-based compensation, that
is conditional in whole or in part on the achievement of
certain targets or the occurrence of certain
circumstances. The explanatory notes to the balance
sheet shall report on any moderation and/or claim for
repayment of board remuneration. No such moderation
or claim for repayment has occurred during the financial
year 2017.
Members of the Board of Management hold shares in
the Company for the purpose of long-term investment
and are required to refrain from short-term transactions
in Philips securities. According to the Philips Rules of
Conduct on Inside Information, members of the Board
of Management are only allowed to trade in Philips
securities (including the exercise of stock options)
during ‘windows’ of twenty business days following the
publication of annual and quarterly results (provided
the person involved has no ‘inside information’
regarding Philips at that time unless an exemption is
available). Furthermore, the Rules of Procedure of the

Board of Management and Executive Committee
contain provisions concerning ownership of and
transactions in non-Philips securities by members of
the Board of Management. Members of the Board of
Management are prohibited from trading, directly or
indirectly, in securities of any of the companies
belonging to the peer group, during one week
preceding the disclosure of Philips’ annual or quarterly
results. The rules referred to above in this paragraph
apply to other members of the Executive Committee
correspondingly. Transactions in shares in the
Company carried out by members of the Board of
Management or members of the Supervisory Board and
other Insiders (if applicable) are notified to the
Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM)
in accordance with the European Market Abuse
Regulation and, if necessary, to other relevant
authorities.

Indemnification of members of the Board of
Management and Supervisory Board
Unless the law provides otherwise, the members of the
Board of Management and of the Supervisory Board
shall be reimbursed by the Company for various costs
and expenses, such as the reasonable costs of
defending claims, as formalized in the Articles of
Association. Under certain circumstances, described in
the Articles of Association, such as an act or failure to
act by a member of the Board of Management or a
member of the Supervisory Board that can be
characterized as intentional (opzettelijk), intentionally
reckless (bewust roekeloos) or seriously culpable
(ernstig verwijtbaar), there will be no entitlement to this
reimbursement unless the law or the principles of
reasonableness and fairness require otherwise. The
Company has also taken out liability insurance (D&O Directors & Officers) for the persons concerned.
In line with regulatory requirements, the Company’s
policy forbids personal loans to and guarantees on
behalf of members of the Board of Management or the
Supervisory Board, and no loans were granted or
guarantees issued to such members in 2017, nor are any
loans or guarantees outstanding as of December 31,
2017.
The aggregate share ownership of the members of the
Board of Management and the Supervisory Board
represents less than 1% of the outstanding ordinary
shares in the Company.

Risk management approach
Risk management and control forms an integral part of
the Philips business planning and performance review
cycle. The Company’s risk and control policy is
designed to provide reasonable assurance that
objectives are met by integrating risk assessment in the
strategic planning process, integrating management
control into the daily operations, ensuring compliance
with legal requirements and safeguarding the integrity
of the Company’s financial reporting and its related
disclosures. The Executive Committee determines the

Annual Report 2017

87

Corporate governance 10.1

risks and appropriate risk responses related to the
achievement of business objectives and critical
business processes. The Executive Committee reports
on and accounts for internal risk management and
control systems to the Supervisory Board and its Audit
Committee. Risk factors and the risk management
approach, as well as the sensitivity of the Company’s
results to external factors and variables, are described
in more detail in chapter 6, Risk management, of this
Annual Report. Significant changes and improvements
in the Company’s risk management and internal control
system have been discussed with the Supervisory
Board’s Audit Committee and the external auditor and
are disclosed in that section as well.
With respect to financial reporting a structured selfassessment and monitoring process is used companywide to assess, document, review and monitor
compliance with internal control over financial
reporting. Internal representations received from
management, regular management reviews, reviews of
the design and effectiveness of internal controls and
reviews in Group and Business Group, Market and
Function Audit & Risk committees are integral parts of
the Company’s risk management approach. On the
basis thereof, the Board of Management confirms that:
(i) the management report provides sufficient insights
into any failings in the effectiveness of the internal risk
management and control systems; (ii) such systems
provide a reasonable level of assurance that the
financial reporting does not contain any material
inaccuracies; (iii) based on the current state of affairs, it
is justified that the financial reporting is prepared on a
going concern basis; and (iv) the management report
states those material risks and uncertainties that are
relevant to the expectation of the company’s continuity
for the period of twelve months after the preparation of
the report. The ﬁnancial statements fairly represent the
ﬁnancial condition and result of operations of the
Company and provide the required disclosures.
It should be noted that the above does not imply that
the internal risk management and control systems
provide certainty as to the realization of operational
and financial business objectives, nor can they prevent
all misstatements, inaccuracies, errors, fraud and noncompliances with rules and regulations.
In view of the above, the Board of Management
believes that it is in compliance with the requirements
of recommendation 1.4.2 of the Dutch Corporate
Governance Code. The above statement on internal
controls should not be construed as a statement in
response to the requirements of section 404 of the US
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The statement as to compliance
with section 404 is set forth in section 11.1,
Management’s report on internal control, of this Annual
Report.
In addition to the Philips General Business Principles
(GBP), the Company has a Financial Code of Ethics
which additionally applies to designated senior

88

Annual Report 2017

executives, including the CEO and the CFO, and to the
senior management in the Philips Finance Leadership
Team who head the Finance departments of the
Company. The GBP and the Financial Code of Ethics
have been published on the Company’s website.
The Company, through the Supervisory Board’s Audit
Committee, also has appropriate procedures in place
for the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints
received by the Company regarding accounting,
internal accounting controls or auditing matters and the
confidential, anonymous submission by employees of
concerns regarding questionable accounting or
auditing matters. The Company’s whistleblower
mechanisms furthermore allow employees and, since
May 2015, external parties to confidentially and
anonymously report grievances to the Company, also
on other topics than those that relate to questionable
accounting or auditing matters. The Company does not
tolerate retaliation against (internal) whistleblowers
who report a concern in good faith. More information
on GBP governance and our whistleblower procedures
can be found in chapter 13, Sustainability statements,
of this Annual Report and chapter 6, Risk
management, of this Annual Report.
In view of the requirements under the US Securities
Exchange Act, procedures are in place to enable the
CEO and the CFO to provide certifications with respect
to the Annual Report on Form 20-F.
A Disclosure Committee is in place, which advises the
various officers and departments involved, including
the CEO and the CFO, on the timely review, publication
and filing of periodic and current (financial) reports. In
addition to the certification by the CEO and the CFO
under US law, each individual member of the Board of
Management and the Supervisory Board must, under
Dutch law, sign the Group and Company financial
statements being disclosed and submitted to the
General Meeting of Shareholders for adoption. If one or
more of their signatures is missing, this shall be stated,
and the reasons given for this. The members of the
Board of Management issue the responsibility
statement as referred to in chapter 11, Group financial
statements, of this Annual Report, as required by
applicable Dutch company law and securities law.

10.2 Supervisory Board
Introduction
The Supervisory Board supervises the policies of the
Board of Management and Executive Committee and
the general course of affairs of Philips and advises the
executive management thereon. The Supervisory
Board, in the two-tier corporate structure under Dutch
law, is a separate body that is independent of the Board
of Management. Its independent character is also
reﬂected in the requirement that members of the
Supervisory Board can be neither a member of the
Board of Management nor an employee of the
Company. The Supervisory Board considers all its

Corporate governance 10.2

members to be independent pursuant to the Dutch
Corporate Governance Code and under the applicable
US Securities and Exchange Commission standards.

are currently appointed by the General Meeting of
Shareholders for fixed terms of four years, upon a
binding recommendation from the Supervisory Board.

The Supervisory Board, acting in the interests of the
Company and the Group and taking into account the
relevant interest of the Company’s stakeholders,
supervises and advises the Board of Management and
Executive Committee in performing its management
tasks and setting the direction of the Group’s business,
including (a) the Group’s performance, (b) the Group’s
view on long-term value creation, (c) the Group’s
culture aimed at long-term value creation, (d) the
Group’s general strategy aimed at long-term value
creation and the risks connected to its business
activities, (e) the operational and financial objectives,
(f) the parameters to be approved in relation to the
strategy, (g) corporate social responsibility issues (h)
the structure and management of the systems of
internal business controls and risk management, (i) the
financial reporting process, (j) the compliance with
applicable laws and regulations, also including the
internal reporting systems on such compliance and the
adequate follow-up thereof, (k) the Company/
shareholder relationship and (l) the corporate
governance structure of the Company and (m) senior
management staffing, including succession planning.
The Group’s strategy and major management decisions
are discussed with and approved by the Supervisory
Board. For a description of further responsibilities and
tasks of the Supervisory Board please refer to the
Supervisory Board’s Rules of Procedure which are
published on the Company’s website.

According to the Company’s Articles of Association, this
binding recommendation may be overruled by a
resolution of the General Meeting of Shareholders
adopted by a simple majority of the votes cast and
representing at least one-third of the issued share
capital. If a simple majority of the votes cast is in favor
of the resolution to overrule the binding
recommendation, but such majority does not represent
at least one-third of the issued share capital, a new
meeting may be convened at which the resolution may
be passed by a simple majority of the votes cast,
regardless of the portion of the issued share capital
represented by such majority. In the event that a
binding recommendation has been overruled, a new
binding recommendation shall be submitted to the
General Meeting of Shareholders. If such second
binding recommendation has been overruled, the
General Meeting of Shareholders shall be free to
appoint a board member.

In its report, the Supervisory Board describes the
composition and functioning of the Supervisory Board
and its committees, the activities of the board and its
committees in the financial year 2017, the number of
committee meetings and the main items discussed.

Candidates for appointment to the Supervisory Board
will be selected while taking into account the Diversity
Policy. As also addressed in the Diversity Policy, Dutch
legislation on board diversity provides that the
Company must pursue a policy of having at least 30%
of the seats on the Supervisory Board held by men and
at least 30% of the seats held by women. The
Supervisory Board’s composition furthermore follows
the profile included in the Rules of Procedure of the
Supervisory Board. For more details on the Diversity
Policy and board diversity please refer to chapter 9,
Supervisory Board report, of this Annual Report.

The Rules of Procedure of the Supervisory Board are
published on the Company’s website. These rules set
forth the Supervisory Board’s governance rules,
covering meetings, items to be discussed, resolutions,
appointment and re-election, committees, conflicts of
interests, trading in securities, and the profile of the
Supervisory Board. The Rules of Procedure also include
the charters of the board’s committees, to which the
plenary Supervisory Board, while retaining overall
responsibility, has assigned certain tasks: the Corporate
Governance and Nomination & Selection Committee,
the Audit Committee, the Remuneration Committee
and the Quality & Regulatory Committee. Each
committee reports to, and submits its minutes for
information to the Supervisory Board.

(Term of) Appointment, composition and
conflicts of interests
The Supervisory Board consists of at least five members
(currently seven), including a Chairman, and a ViceChairman and Secretary. The Dutch ‘large company
regime’ does not apply to the Company itself. Members

There is no age limit applicable. Members are eligible
for re-appointment for a fixed term of four years once,
and may subsequently be re-appointed for a period of
two years which appointment may be extended by at
most two years. The report of the Supervisory Board
should include reasons for any re-appointment beyond
an eight-year period. The date of expiration of the
terms of Supervisory Board members is published on
the Company’s website.

In line with US and Dutch best practices, the Chairman
of the Supervisory Board must be independent, as
determined in accordance with the Dutch Corporate
Governance Code. Furthermore, the Dutch Corporate
Governance Code sets forth certain limitations on the
number of non-independent members of the
Supervisory Board, and its committees. As mentioned
in the introduction to this section 11.2 above, the
Supervisory Board considers all its members to be
independent.
The Supervisory Board is assisted by the secretary
within the meaning of best practice provision 2.3.10 of
the Dutch Corporate Governance Code (the
“Secretary”). The Secretary sees to it that correct

Annual Report 2017

89

Corporate governance 10.2

procedures are followed and that the Supervisory
Board acts in accordance with its statutory obligations
and its obligations under the Articles of Association.
Furthermore, the Secretary assists the Chairman of the
Supervisory Board in the actual organization of the
affairs of the Supervisory Board (information, agenda,
evaluation, introductory program) and is the contact
person for interested parties who want to make
concerns known to the Supervisory Board. The
Secretary shall be appointed, and may be dismissed by
the Board of Management, subject to the approval of
the Supervisory Board.
Individual data on the members of the Supervisory
Board are published in the Annual Report, and updated
on the Company’s website. Members may be
suspended and dismissed by the General Meeting of
Shareholders. In the event of inadequate performance,
structural incompatibility of interests, and in other
instances in which resignation is deemed necessary in
the opinion of the Supervisory Board, the Supervisory
Board shall submit to the General Meeting of
Shareholders a proposal to dismiss the respective
member of the Supervisory Board.
After their appointment, all members of the Supervisory
Board shall follow an introductory program, which
covers general financial and legal affairs, financial
reporting by the Company, any specific aspects that are
unique to the Company, its business activities and its
culture, and the responsibilities of a Supervisory Board
member.
Any need for further training or education of members
will be reviewed annually, also on the basis of an
annual evaluation survey.
Dutch legislation provides that no member of the
Supervisory Board shall hold more than five NonExecutive Directorships at ‘large’ companies or
foundations as defined under Dutch law (see section
10.1, Board of Management and Executive Committee,
of this Annual Report), with a position as chairman
counting for two. During the financial year 2017 all
members of the Supervisory Board complied with the
limitations on Non-Executive Directorships described
above.
Dutch legislation on conflict of interests provides that a
member of the Supervisory Board may not participate
in the adoption of resolutions if he or she has a direct
or indirect personal conflict of interest with the
Company or related enterprise. If all members of the
Supervisory Board have a conflict, the resolution
concerned must be considered by the General Meeting
of Shareholders. The Company’s corporate governance
includes rules to specify situations in which a (potential)
conflict may exist, to avoid (potential) conflicts of
interests as much as possible, and to deal with such
conflicts should they arise.

90

Annual Report 2017

Relevant matters relating to conflicts of interests, if any,
shall be mentioned in the Annual Report for the
financial year in question. No decisions to enter into
material transactions in which there are conflicts of
interest with members of the Supervisory Board were
taken during the financial year 2017.

Meetings of the Supervisory Board
The Supervisory Board meets at least six times per year,
including a meeting on strategy. The Supervisory Board,
on the advice of its Audit Committee, also discusses, in
any event at least once a year, the main risks of the
business, and the result of the assessment of the
structure and operation of the internal risk
management and control systems, as well as any
significant changes thereto. The members of the
Executive Committee attend meetings of the
Supervisory Board except in matters such as the
desired profile, composition and competence of the
Supervisory Board and the Executive Committee, as
well as the remuneration and performance of individual
members of the Executive Committee and the
conclusions that must be drawn on the basis thereof. In
addition to these items, the Supervisory Board, being
responsible for the quality of its own performance,
discusses, at least once a year on its own, without the
members of the Executive Committee being present, (i)
both its own functioning and that of the individual
members, and the conclusions that must be drawn on
the basis thereof, as well as (ii) both the functioning of
the Board of Management and that of the individual
members, and the conclusions that must be drawn on
the basis thereof. The CEO and other members of the
Executive Committee meet on a regular basis with the
Chairman and other members of the Supervisory Board.
The Executive Committee is required to keep the
Supervisory Board informed of all facts and
developments concerning Philips that the Supervisory
Board may need in order to function as required and to
properly carry out its duties, to consult it on important
matters and to submit certain important decisions to it
for its prior approval. The Supervisory Board and its
individual members each have their own responsibility
to request from the Executive Committee and the
external auditor all information that the Supervisory
Board needs in order to be able to carry out its duties
properly as a supervisory body. If the Supervisory
Board considers it necessary, it may obtain information
from officers and external advisers of the Company. The
Company provides the necessary means for this
purpose. The Supervisory Board may also require that
certain officers and external advisers attend its
meetings.

The Chairman of the Supervisory Board
The Supervisory Board’s Chairman will see to it that: (a)
the members of the Supervisory Board follow their
introductory program, (b) the members of the
Supervisory Board receive in good time all information
which is necessary for the proper performance of their
duties, (c) there is sufficient time for consultation and
decision-making by the Supervisory Board, (d) the

Corporate governance 10.2

committees of the Supervisory Board function properly,
the performance of the Executive Committee members
and Supervisory Board members is assessed at least
once a year, and (f) the Supervisory Board elects a ViceChairman. The Vice-Chairman of the Supervisory Board
shall deputize for the Chairman when the occasion
arises. The Vice-Chairman shall act as the point of
contact for individual members of the Supervisory
Board or the Board of Management concerning the
functioning of the Chairman of the Supervisory Board.

Remuneration of the Supervisory Board and
share ownership
The remuneration of the individual members of the
Supervisory Board, as well as the additional
remuneration for its Chairman and the members of its
committees is determined by the General Meeting of
Shareholders. The remuneration of a Supervisory Board
member is not dependent on the results of the
Company. Further details are published in the
Supervisory Board report.
Shares or rights to shares shall not be granted to a
Supervisory Board member. In accordance with the
Rules of Procedure of the Supervisory Board, any
shares in the Company held by a Supervisory Board
member are long-term investments. The Supervisory
Board has adopted a policy on ownership of and
transactions in non-Philips securities by members of
the Supervisory Board. This policy is included in the
Rules of Procedure of the Supervisory Board.

The Corporate Governance and Nomination
& Selection Committee
The Corporate Governance and Nomination & Selection
Committee consists of at least the Chairman and ViceChairman of the Supervisory Board. The Committee
reviews the corporate governance principles applicable
to the Company at least once a year, and advises the
Supervisory Board on any changes to these principles
as it deems appropriate. It also (a) draws up selection
criteria and appointment procedures for members of
the Supervisory Board, the Board of Management and
the Executive Committee; (b) periodically assesses the
Diversity Policy for the Supervisory Board, the Board of
Management and the Executive Committee, the size
and composition of the Supervisory Board, the Board
of Management and the Executive Committee, and
makes the proposals for a composition profile of the
Supervisory Board, if appropriate; (c) periodically
assesses the functioning of individual members of the
Supervisory Board, the Board of Management and the
Executive Committee, and reports on this to the
Supervisory Board. The Committee also consults with
the CEO and the Executive Committee on candidates
to fill vacancies on the Supervisory Board, the Board of
Management and the Executive Committee, and
advises the Supervisory Board on the candidates for
appointment. It further supervises the policy of the
Executive Committee on the selection criteria and
appointment procedures for Philips Executives.

The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee meets at least twice a
year and is responsible for preparing decisions of the
Supervisory Board on the remuneration of individual
members of the Board of Management and the
Executive Committee.
The Remuneration Committee prepares an annual
remuneration report. The remuneration report contains
an account of the manner in which the remuneration
policy has been implemented in the past ﬁnancial year,
as well as an overview of the implementation of the
remuneration policy planned by the Supervisory Board
for the next year(s). The Supervisory Board aims to have
appropriate experience available within the
Remuneration Committee. No more than one member
of the Remuneration Committee shall be an executive
board member of another Dutch listed company.
In performing its duties and responsibilities, the
Remuneration Committee is assisted by an external
consultant and an in-house remuneration expert acting
on the basis of a protocol ensuring that the expert acts
on the instructions of the Remuneration Committee and
on an independent basis in which conﬂicts of interests
are avoided.

The Audit Committee
The Audit Committee meets at least four times a year,
before the publication of the annual, semi-annual and
quarterly results. All of the members of the Audit
Committee are considered to be independent under
the applicable US Securities and Exchange Commission
rules and at least one of the members of the Audit
Committee, which currently consists of four members
of the Supervisory Board, shall be a financial expert in
the sense of the applicable rules under the Dutch
Corporate Governance Code or Dutch law, and each
member shall be financially literate. Jackson Tai and
David Pyott are each designated as an Audit Committee
financial expert, as defined under the regulations of the
US Securities and Exchange Commission. The Audit
Committee as a whole shall have the competence
relevant to the sector in which the Company is
operating. The Supervisory Board considers the
expertise and experience available in the Audit
Committee, as well as the possibility to take advice from
internal and external experts and advisors, to be
sufficient for the fulfillment of the tasks and
responsibilities of the Audit Committee. The Audit
Committee may not be chaired by the Chairman of the
Supervisory Board or by a (former) member of the
Board of Management.
The tasks and functions of the Audit Committee, as
described in its charter, which is published on the
Company’s website as part of the Rules of Procedure
of the Supervisory Board, include the duties
recommended in the Dutch Corporate Governance
Code. More specifically, the Audit Committee assists
the Supervisory Board in fulfilling its oversight
responsibilities for the integrity of the Company’s

Annual Report 2017

91

Corporate governance 10.2

financial statements, the financial reporting process,
the effectiveness (also in respect of the financial
reporting process) of the system of internal business
controls and risk management, the internal and
external audit process, the internal and external
auditor’s qualifications, its independence and its
performance, as well as the Company’s process for
monitoring compliance with laws and regulations and
the General Business Principles (GBP). The Audit
Committee reports its findings to the Supervisory
Board, and submits recommendations to ensure the
integrity of the financial reporting process.
The Audit Committee reviews the Company’s annual
and interim financial statements, including nonfinancial information, prior to publication and advises
the Supervisory Board on the adequacy and
appropriateness of internal control policies and internal
audit programs and their findings. It also reports to the
Supervisory Board the most important points of
discussion between the external auditor and the Board
of Management on the draft management letter and
the draft annual report.
In reviewing the Company’s annual and interim
statements, including non-financial information, and
advising the Supervisory Board on internal control
policies and internal audit programs, the Audit
Committee reviews matters relating to accounting
policies and compliance with accounting standards and
compliance with statutory and legal requirements and
regulations, particularly in the financial domain.
Important findings and identified risks are examined
thoroughly by the Audit Committee in order to allow
appropriate measures to be taken. With regard to the
internal audit, the Audit Committee, in cooperation with
the external auditor, reviews the internal audit charter,
audit plan, audit scope and its coverage in relation to
the scope of the external audit, staffing, independence
and organizational structure of the internal audit
function. Decisions from the Board of Management
regarding the appointment and removal of the internal
auditor are subject to the approval of the Audit
Committee.
With regard to the external audit, the Audit Committee
(among others) reviews the proposed audit scope
(including the main risks of the reporting process),
approach and fees, the independence of the external
auditor, its performance and its (re-)appointment (or
dismissal), audit and permitted non-audit services
provided by the external auditor in conformity with the
Philips Policy on Auditor Independence, as well as any
changes to this policy. The Audit Committee also
considers the report of the external auditor with respect
to the annual financial statements and its report on
internal control. The Audit Committee acts as the
principal contact for the external auditor if the auditor
discovers irregularities in the content of the financial
reports. It also advises on the Supervisory Board’s
statement to shareholders in the annual accounts. The

92

Annual Report 2017

Audit Committee periodically discusses the Company’s
policy on business controls, the GBP and the
deployment thereof, overviews on tax, IT and IT
security, litigation and legal proceedings,
environmental exposures, financial exposures in the
area of treasury, real estate, pensions, and the Group’s
major areas of risk. The Company’s external auditor, in
general, attends all Audit Committee meetings.

The Quality & Regulatory Committee
The Quality & Regulatory Committee has been
established by the Supervisory Board in view of the
central importance of the quality of the Company’s
products, systems, services and software and the
development, testing, manufacturing, marketing and
servicing thereof, and regulatory requirements relating
thereto. The Quality & Regulatory Committee assists
the Supervisory Board in fulfilling its oversight
responsibilities in this area, whilst recognizing that the
Audit Committee assists the Supervisory Board in the
oversight of other areas of regulatory, compliance and
legal matters.
The Quality & Regulatory Committee consists of at least
two members and meets as often as is necessary or
desirable for the performance of its duties.

10.3 General Meeting of Shareholders
Introduction
A General Meeting of Shareholders is held at least once
a year to discuss the Annual Report, including the report
of the Board of Management, the annual financial
statements with explanatory notes thereto and
additional information required by law, and the
Supervisory Board report, any proposal concerning
dividends or other distributions, the (re-)appointment
of members of the Board of Management and
Supervisory Board (if any), important management
decisions as required by Dutch law, and any other
matters proposed by the Supervisory Board, the Board
of Management or shareholders in accordance with the
provisions of the Company’s Articles of Association.
The Annual Report, the financial statements and other
regulated information such as defined in the Dutch Act
on Financial Supervision (Wet op het financieel
toezicht), will solely be published in English. As a
separate agenda item and in application of Dutch law,
the General Meeting of Shareholders discusses the
discharge of the members of the Board of Management
and the Supervisory Board from responsibility for the
performance of their respective duties in the preceding
financial year. However, this discharge only covers
matters that are known to the Company and the
General Meeting of Shareholders when the resolution
is adopted. The General Meeting of Shareholders is
held in Eindhoven, Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague,
Utrecht or Haarlemmermeer (including Schiphol
Airport) no later than six months after the end of the
financial year.

Corporate governance 10.3

Meetings are convened by public notice, via the
Company’s website or other electronic means of
communication, and registered shareholders are
notified by letter or by the use of electronic means of
communication, at least 42 days prior to the
(Extraordinary) General Meeting of Shareholders.
Extraordinary General Meetings of Shareholders may
be convened by the Supervisory Board or the Board of
Management if deemed necessary and must be held if
shareholders jointly representing at least 10% of the
outstanding share capital make a written request to that
effect to the Supervisory Board and the Board of
Management, specifying in detail the business to be
dealt with. The agenda of a General Meeting of
Shareholders shall contain such business as may be
placed thereon by the Board of Management or the
Supervisory Board, and agenda items will be explained
where necessary in writing. The agenda shall list which
items are for discussion and which items are to be voted
upon.
Material amendments to the Articles of Association and
resolutions for the appointment of members of the
Board of Management and Supervisory Board shall be
submitted separately to the General Meeting of
Shareholders, it being understood that amendments
and other proposals that are connected in the context
of a proposed (part of the) governance structure may
be submitted as one proposal. In accordance with the
Articles of Association and Dutch law, requests from
shareholders for items to be included on the agenda
will generally be honored, subject to the Company’s
rights to refuse to include the requested agenda item
under Dutch law, provided that such requests are made
in writing at least 60 days before a General Meeting of
Shareholders to the Board of Management and the
Supervisory Board by shareholders representing at
least 1% of the Company’s outstanding capital or,
according to the ofﬁcial price list of Euronext
Amsterdam, representing a value of at least EUR 50
million. Written requests may be submitted
electronically and shall comply with the procedure
stipulated by the Board of Management, which
procedure is posted on the Company’s website.
Pursuant to Dutch legislation, shareholders requesting
an item to be included on the agenda, have an
obligation to disclose their full economic interest (i.e.
long position and short position) to the Company. The
Company has the obligation to publish such disclosures
on its website.

Main powers of the General Meeting of
Shareholders
All outstanding shares carry voting rights. The main
powers of the General Meeting of Shareholders are to
appoint, suspend and dismiss members of the Board of
Management and of the Supervisory Board, to adopt
the annual accounts, to declare dividends, to discharge
the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board
from responsibility for the performance of their
respective duties for the previous ﬁnancial year, to

appoint the external auditor as required by Dutch law,
to adopt amendments to the Articles of Association and
proposals to dissolve or liquidate the Company, to issue
shares or rights to shares, to restrict or exclude preemptive rights of shareholders and to repurchase or
cancel outstanding shares. Following common
corporate practice in the Netherlands, the Company
each year requests limited authorization to issue (rights
to) shares, to restrict or exclude pre-emptive rights and
to repurchase shares. In compliance with Dutch law,
decisions of the Board of Management that are so farreaching that they would greatly change the identity or
nature of the Company or the business require the
approval of the General Meeting of Shareholders. This
includes resolutions to: (a) transfer the business of the
Company, or almost the entire business of the
Company, to a third party (b) enter into or discontinue
long-term cooperation by the Company or a subsidiary
with another legal entity or company or as a fully liable
partner in a limited partnership or ordinary partnership,
if this cooperation or its discontinuation is of material
signiﬁcance to the Company or (c) acquire or dispose of
a participating interest in the capital of a company to
the value of at least one-third of the amount of the
assets according to the balance sheet and notes
thereto or, if the Company prepares a consolidated
balance sheet, according to the consolidated balance
sheet and notes thereto as published in the last
adopted annual accounts of the Company, by the
Company or one of its subsidiaries. Thus the Company
applies principle 4.1 of the Dutch Corporate
Governance Code within the framework of the Articles
of Association and Dutch law and in the manner as
described in this corporate governance report.
The Board of Management and Supervisory Board are
also accountable, at the Annual General Meeting of
Shareholders, for the policy on the additions to reserves
and dividends (the level and purpose of the additions
to reserves, the amount of the dividend and the type of
dividend). This subject is dealt with and explained as a
separate agenda item at the Annual General Meeting of
Shareholders. A resolution to pay a dividend is dealt
with as a separate agenda item at the General Meeting
of Shareholders.
The Board of Management and the Supervisory Board
are required to provide the General Meeting of
Shareholders with all requested information, unless this
would be prejudicial to an overriding interest of the
Company. If the Board of Management and the
Supervisory Board invoke an overriding interest in
refusing to provide information, reasons must be given.
If a serious private bid is made for a business unit or a
participating interest and the value of the bid exceeds
a certain threshold (currently one-third of the amount
of the assets according to the balance sheet and notes
thereto or, if the Company prepares a consolidated
balance sheet, according to the consolidated balance
sheet and notes thereto as published in the last
adopted annual accounts of the Company), and such

Annual Report 2017

93

Corporate governance 10.3

bid is made public, the Board of Management shall, at
its earliest convenience, make public its position on the
bid and the reasons for this position.
A resolution to dissolve the Company or change its
Articles of Association can be adopted at a General
Meeting of Shareholders by at least three-quarters of
the votes cast, at which meeting more than half of the
issued share capital is represented. If the requisite share
capital is not represented, a further meeting shall be
convened, to be held within eight weeks of the first
meeting, to which no quorum requirement applies.
Furthermore, the resolution requires the approval of the
Supervisory Board. If the resolution is proposed by the
Board of Management, the adoption needs an absolute
majority of votes and no quorum requirement applies
to the meeting.

Repurchase and issue of (rights to) shares
At the 2017 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders it
was resolved to authorize the Board of Management,
subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, to
acquire shares in the Company within the limits of the
Articles of Association and within a certain price range
up to and including November 10, 2018. The maximum
number of shares the company may hold, will not
exceed 10% of the issued share capital as of May 11,
2017, which number may be increased by 10% of the
issued capital as of that same date in connection with
the execution of share repurchase programs for capital
reduction programs.
In addition, at the 2017 Annual General Meeting of
Shareholders it was resolved to authorize the Board of
Management, subject to the approval of the
Supervisory Board, to issue shares or grant rights to
acquire shares in the Company as well as to restrict or
exclude the pre-emption right accruing to shareholders
up to and including November 10, 2018. This
authorization is limited to a maximum of 10% of the
number of shares issued as of May 11, 2017 plus 10% of
the issued capital in connection with or on the occasion
of mergers, acquisitions and/or strategic alliances.

10.4 Meeting logistics and other
information
Introduction
Pursuant to Dutch law, the record date for the exercise
of voting rights and rights relating to General Meetings
of Shareholders is set as the 28th day prior to the day
of the meeting. Shareholders registered on such date
are entitled to attend the meeting and to exercise the
other shareholder rights (in the meeting in question)
notwithstanding subsequent sale of their shares
thereafter. This date will be published in advance of
every General Meeting of Shareholders.
Information which is required to be published or
deposited pursuant to the provisions of company law
and securities law applicable to the Company and
which is relevant to the shareholders, is placed and

94

Annual Report 2017

updated on the Company’s website, or hyperlinks are
established. The Board of Management and
Supervisory Board shall ensure that the General
Meeting of Shareholders is informed of facts and
circumstances relevant to proposed resolutions in
explanatory notes to the agenda and, if deemed
appropriate, by means of a ‘shareholders circular’
published on the Company’s website.
Resolutions adopted at a General Meeting of
Shareholders shall be recorded by a civil law notary and
co-signed by the chairman of the meeting; such
resolutions shall also be published on the Company’s
website within 15 days after the meeting. A draft
summary of the discussions during the General Meeting
of Shareholders, in the language of the meeting, is
made available to shareholders, on request, no later
than three months after the meeting. Shareholders shall
have the opportunity to respond to this summary for
three months, after which a ﬁnal summary is adopted
by the chairman of the meeting in question. Such ﬁnal
summary shall be made available on the Company’s
website.

Registration, attending meetings and proxy
voting
Holders of common shares who wish to exercise the
rights attached to their shares in respect of a General
Meeting of Shareholders, are required to register for
such meeting. Shareholders may attend a General
Meeting of Shareholders in person, or may grant a
power of attorney to a third party to attend the meeting
and to vote on their behalf. Holders of common shares
in bearer form will also be able to give voting
instructions via the Internet (assuming the agenda for
such meeting includes voting items). In addition, the
Company will distribute a voting instruction form for a
General Meeting of Shareholders. By giving voting
instructions via Internet or by returning the form,
shareholders grant power to an independent proxy
holder who will vote according to the instructions
expressly given on the voting instruction form. Also
other persons entitled to vote shall be given the
possibility to give voting proxies or instructions to an
independent third party prior to the meeting. Details on
the registration for meetings, attendance and proxy
voting will be included in the notice convening a
General Meeting of Shareholders.

Preference shares and the Stichting
Preferente Aandelen Philips
As a means to protect the Company and its
stakeholders against an unsolicited attempt to obtain
(de facto) control of the Company, the General Meeting
of Shareholders in 1989 adopted amendments to the
Company’s Articles of Association that allow the Board
of Management and the Supervisory Board to issue
(rights to) preference shares to a third-party. As a result,
Stichting Preferente Aandelen Philips (the Foundation)
was created, which was granted the right to acquire
preference shares in the Company. The mere
notification that the Foundation wishes to exercise its

Corporate governance 10.4

rights, should a third-party ever seem likely in the
judgment of the Foundation to obtain (de facto) control
of the Company, will result in the preference shares
being effectively issued. The Foundation may exercise
this right for as many preference shares as there are
ordinary shares in the Company outstanding at that
time. No preference shares have been issued as of
December 31, 2017. In addition, the Foundation has the
right to file a petition with the Enterprise Chamber of
the Amsterdam Court of Appeal to commence an
inquiry procedure within the meaning of section 2:344
Dutch Civil Code.
The object of the Foundation is to represent the
interests of the Company, the enterprises maintained
by the Company and its affiliated companies within the
Group, in such a way that the interests of Philips, those
enterprises and all parties involved with them are
safeguarded as effectively as possible, and that they
are afforded maximum protection against influences
which, in conflict with those interests, may undermine
the autonomy and identity of Philips and those
enterprises, and also to do anything related to the
above ends or conducive to them. In the event of (an
attempt at) a hostile takeover or other attempt to obtain
(de facto) control of the Company, this arrangement will
allow the Company and its Board of Management and
Supervisory Board to determine its position in relation
to the third-party and its plans, to seek alternatives and
to defend Philips’ interests and those of its
stakeholders from a position of strength. The members
of the self-electing Board of the Foundation are Messrs
J.M. Hessels, F.J.G.M. Cremers and P.N. Wakkie. No
Philips board members or officers are represented on
the board of the Foundation.
The Company does not have any other anti-takeover
measures in the sense of other measures which
exclusively or almost exclusively have the purpose of
frustrating future public bids for the shares in the capital
of the Company in case no agreement is reached with
the Board of Management on such public bid.
Furthermore, the Company does not have measures
which specifically have the purpose of preventing a
bidder who has acquired 75% of the shares in the capital
of the Company from appointing or dismissing
members of the Board of Management and
subsequently amending the Articles of Association of
the Company. It should be noted that also in the event
of (an attempt at) a hostile takeover or other attempt to
obtain (de facto) control of the Company, the Board of
Management and the Supervisory Board are authorized
to exercise in the interests of Philips all powers vested
in them.

Annual financial statements
The annual financial statements are prepared by the
Board of Management and reviewed by the
Supervisory Board upon the advice of its Audit
Committee, taking into account the report of the
external auditor. Upon approval by the Supervisory

Board, the accounts are signed by all members of both
the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board
and are published together with the opinion of the
external auditor. The Board of Management is
responsible, under the supervision of the Supervisory
Board, for the quality and completeness of such
publicly disclosed financial reports. The annual
financial statements are presented for discussion and
adoption at the Annual General Meeting of
Shareholders, to be convened subsequently. The
Company, under US securities regulations, separately
files its Annual Report on Form 20-F, incorporating
major parts of the Annual Report as prepared under the
requirements of Dutch law.

Internal controls and disclosure policies
Comprehensive internal procedures, compliance with
which is supervised by the Supervisory Board, are in
place for the preparation and publication of the Annual
Report, the annual accounts, the quarterly figures and
ad hoc financial information. As from 2003, the internal
assurance process for business risk assessment has
been strengthened and the review frequency has been
upgraded to a quarterly review cycle, in line with best
practices in this area.
As part of these procedures, a Disclosure Committee
has been appointed by the Board of Management to
oversee the Company’s disclosure activities and to
assist the Board of Management in fulfilling its
responsibilities in this respect. The Committee’s
purpose is to ensure that the Company implements and
maintains internal procedures for the timely collection,
evaluation and disclosure, as appropriate, of
information potentially subject to public disclosure
under the legal, regulatory and stock exchange
requirements to which the Company is subject. Such
procedures are designed to capture information that is
relevant to an assessment of the need to disclose
developments and risks that pertain to the Company’s
various businesses, and the effectiveness of those
procedures for this purpose will be reviewed
periodically.

Auditor information
In accordance with the procedures laid down in the
Philips Auditor Policy and as mandatorily required by
Dutch law, the external auditor of the Company is
appointed by the General Meeting of Shareholders on
the proposal of the Supervisory Board, after the latter
has been advised by the Audit Committee and the
Board of Management. Under this Auditor Policy, the
Supervisory Board and the Audit Committee assess the
functioning of the external auditor. The main
conclusions of this assessment shall be communicated
to the General Meeting of Shareholders for the
purposes of assessing the nomination for the
appointment of the external auditor.
The current auditor of the Company, Ernst & Young
Accountants LLP (EY), was appointed at the 2015
Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, for a term of

Annual Report 2017

95

Corporate governance 10.4

four years starting January 1, 2016. Mrs. S.D.J.
Overbeek-Goeseije is the current partner of EY in
charge of the audit duties for Philips.
The external auditor attends, in principle, all meetings
of the Audit Committee. The findings of the external
auditor, the audit approach and the risk analysis are
also discussed at these meetings. The external auditor
attends the meeting of the Supervisory Board at which
the report of the external auditor with respect to the
audit of the annual accounts is discussed, and at which
the annual accounts are approved. In its audit report on
the annual accounts to the Board of Management and
the Supervisory Board, the external auditor refers to the
financial reporting risks and issues that were identified
during the audit, internal control matters, and any other
matters, as appropriate, requiring communication
under the auditing and other standards generally
accepted in the Netherlands and the US.
The partner of the external auditor in charge of the audit
duties for Philips shall attend the Annual General
Meeting of Shareholders. Questions may be put to him/
her at the meeting about his/her report. The Board of
Management and the Audit Committee of the
Supervisory Board shall report on their dealings with
the external auditor to the Supervisory Board on an
annual basis, particularly with regard to the auditor’s
independence. The Supervisory Board shall take this
into account when deciding upon its nomination for the
appointment of an external auditor.

Auditor policy
Dutch law requires the separation of audit and nonaudit services, meaning the Company’s external auditor
is no longer allowed to provide non-audit services. This
is reflected in the Auditor Policy, which is published on
the Company’s website. The policy is also in line with
US Securities and Exchange Commission rules under
which the appointed external auditor must be
independent of the Company both in fact and
appearance.
The Auditor Policy includes rules for the pre-approval
by the Audit Committee of all services to be provided
by the external auditor. Proposed services may be preapproved at the beginning of the year by the Audit
Committee (annual pre-approval) or may be preapproved during the year by the Audit Committee in
respect of a particular engagement (specific preapproval). The annual pre-approval is based on a
detailed, itemized list of services to be provided, which
is designed to ensure that there is no management
discretion in determining whether a service has been
approved and to ensure the Audit Committee is
informed of each services it is pre-approving. Unless
pre-approval with respect to a specific service has been
given at the beginning of the year, each proposed
service requires specific pre-approval during the year.
Any annually pre-approved services where the fee for
the engagement is expected to exceed pre-approved
cost levels or budgeted amounts will also require

96

Annual Report 2017

specific pre-approval. The term of any annual preapproval is 12 months from the date of the pre-approval
unless the Audit Committee states otherwise. During
2017, there were no services provided to the Company
by the external auditor which were not pre-approved
by the Audit Committee.

10.5 Investor Relations
Introduction
The Company is continually striving to improve
relations with its shareholders. In addition to
communication with its shareholders at the Annual
General Meeting of Shareholders, Philips elaborates
upon its financial results during (public) conference
calls, which are broadly accessible. It publishes
informative annual, semi-annual and quarterly reports
and press releases, and informs investors via its
extensive website. The Company is strict in its
compliance with applicable rules and regulations on
fair and non-selective disclosure and equal treatment
of shareholders.
From time to time the Company communicates with
investors via road shows, broker conferences and a
Capital Markets Day, announced in advance on the
Company’s website. Shareholders can follow in real
time, by means of webcasting or telephone lines, the
meetings and presentations organized by the
Company. Thus the Company applies recommendation
4.2.3 of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, which
in its perception and in view of market practice does not
extend to less important analyst meetings and
presentations. It is Philips’ policy to post presentations
to analysts and shareholders on the Company’s
website. These meetings and presentations will not
take place shortly before the publication of annual,
semi-annual and quarterly financial information.
Furthermore, the Company engages in bilateral
communications with investors. These take place either
at the initiative of the Company or at the initiative of
investors. The Company is generally represented by its
Investor Relations department during these
interactions, however, on a limited number of occasions
the Investor Relations department is accompanied by
one or more members of the senior management. The
subject matter of the bilateral communications ranges
from individual queries from investors to more
elaborate discussions following disclosures that the
Company has made, such as its annual and quarterly
reports. Also here, the Company is strict in its
compliance with applicable rules and regulations on
fair and non-selective disclosure and equal treatment
of shareholders.
The Company shall not, in advance, assess, comment
upon or correct, other than factually, any analyst’s
reports or valuations. No fee will be paid by the
Company to any party for the carrying-out of research

Corporate governance 10.5

for analysts’ reports or for the production or publication
of analysts’ reports, with the exception of credit-rating
agencies.

Major shareholders and other information for
shareholders
The Dutch Act on Financial Supervision imposes an
obligation on persons holding certain interests to
disclose (inter alia) percentage holdings in the capital
and/or voting rights in the Company when such
holdings reach, exceed or fall below 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25,
30, 40, 50, 60, 75 and 95 percent (as a result of an
acquisition or disposal by a person, or as a result of a
change in the company’s total number of voting rights
or capital issued). Certain derivatives (settled in kind or
in cash) are also taken into account when calculating
the capital interest. The statutory obligation to disclose
capital interest does not only relate to gross long
positions, but also to gross short positions. Required
disclosures must be made to the Netherlands Authority
for the Financial Markets (AFM) without delay. The AFM
then notifies such disclosures to the Company and
includes them in a register which is published on the
AFM’s website. Furthermore, an obligation to disclose
(net) short positions is set out in the EU Regulation on
Short Selling.
The AFM register shows the following notification of
substantial holdings and/or voting rights at or above
the 3% threshold: BlackRock, Inc.: substantial holding of
5.03% and 6.19% of the voting rights (January 5, 2017).
As per December 31, 2017, approximately 90% of the
common shares were held in bearer form and
approximately 10% of the common shares were
represented by registered shares of New York Registry
issued in the name of approximately 1,034 holders of
record, including Cede & Co. Cede & Co acts as nominee
for the Depository Trust Company holding the shares
(indirectly) for individual investors as beneficiaries.
Citibank, N.A., 388 Greenwich Street, New York, New
York 10013 is the transfer agent and registrar.

of corporate bonds the Company might be required to
offer to purchase the bonds that are still outstanding at
a purchase price equal to 101% of their principal
amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.
Furthermore, the conditions applicable to the EUR
denominated corporate bonds issued in 2017 (due 2019
and 2023) contain a similar provision (‘Change of
Control Put Event’). Upon the occurrence of such an
event, the Company might be required to redeem or
purchase any of such bonds at their principal amount
together with interest accrued.

Corporate seat and head office
The statutory seat of the Company is Eindhoven, the
Netherlands, and the statutory list of all subsidiaries
and afﬁliated companies, prepared in accordance with
the relevant legal requirements (Dutch Civil Code, Book
2, Sections 379 and 414), forms part of the notes to the
consolidated ﬁnancial statements and is deposited at
the ofﬁce of the Commercial Register in Eindhoven, the
Netherlands (ﬁle no. 17001910).
The executive ofﬁces of the Company are located at the
Philips Center, Amstelplein 2, 1096 BC Amsterdam, the
Netherlands, telephone +31-20-59 77 777.

Compliance with the Dutch Corporate
Governance Code
In accordance with the governmental Decree of August
29, 2017, the Company fully complies with the Dutch
Corporate Governance Code and applies all its
principles and best practice provisions that are
addressed to the Board of Management or the
Supervisory Board. The full text of the Dutch Corporate
Governance Code can be found at the website of the
Monitoring Commission Corporate Governance Code

Only bearer shares are traded on the stock market of
Euronext Amsterdam. Only shares of New York Registry
– with the laws of the State of New York governing the
proprietary regime of such shares as a result of which
the transfer of, or the creation of in rem rights in, such
shares is governed by the laws of the State of New York
– are traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Bearer
shares and registered shares may be exchanged for
each other. Since certain shares are held by brokers and
other nominees, these numbers may not be
representative of the actual number of United States
beneficial holders or the number of Shares of New York
Registry beneficially held by US residents.
The provisions applicable to all USD denominated
corporate bonds issued by the Company in March 2008
and March 2012 (due 2022, 2038 and 2042) contain a

11.1 Management’s report on internal
control
Management’s report on internal control
over financial reporting pursuant to section
404 of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act
The Board of Management of Koninklijke Philips N.V.
(the Company) is responsible for establishing and
maintaining an adequate system of internal control
over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule
13a15 (f) under the US Securities Exchange Act). Internal
control over financial reporting is a process to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our
financial reporting for external purposes in accordance
with IFRS as issued by the IASB.
Internal control over financial reporting includes
maintaining records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary for preparation of our financial statements;
providing reasonable assurance that receipts and
expenditures of company assets are made in
accordance with management authorization; and
providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of company assets that
could have a material effect on our financial statements
would be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute
assurance that a misstatement of our financial
statements would be prevented or detected. Also,
projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting to future
periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.

11.1.1 Changes in internal control over financial
reporting
In 2016, the separation of Royal Philips and Philips
Lighting was completed, with Philips Lighting being
publicly listed and being traded on the Euronext
exchange in Amsterdam. On November 28, 2017 Royal
Philips reduced its stake in Philips Lighting to 29.01% of
issued share capital and no longer consolidates Philips
Lighting. From November 29, 2017 Philips Lighting was
no longer included in the internal control over financial
reporting framework of Royal Philips.
On June 30, 2017 Royal Philips sold 80.1% of its stake
in Lumileds, with the remaining 19.9% stake no longer
being consolidated. From July 1, 2017 Lumileds was no
longer included in the internal control over financial
reporting framework of Royal Philips.
During fiscal year 2017, Royal Philips implemented
internal controls to ensure we have adequately
evaluated our contracts and properly assessed the
impact of the new accounting standards related to
revenue recognition and financial instruments in our
financial statements to facilitate their adoption on
January 1, 2018.
Other than as explained above, there were no other
changes in our internal control over financial reporting
during 2017 that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.

The Board of Management conducted an assessment
of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting based on the “Internal Control Integrated
Framework (2013)” established by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO).
Based on the Board of Management’s assessment of
the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, it has
concluded that, as of December 31, 2017, the
Company’s internal control over Group financial
reporting is considered effective.
The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, as
included in this section Group financial statements, has
been audited by Ernst & Young Accountants LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm, as
stated in their report which follows hereafter.

reporting
Report of Independent Registered Public
Accounting Firm
To: The Supervisory Board and Shareholders of
Koninklijke Philips N.V.
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited Koninklijke Philips N.V.’s internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017,
based on criteria established in Internal Control —
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In
our opinion, Koninklijke Philips N.V. (the Company)
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017,
based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance
sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and
2016, the related consolidated statements of income,
comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in
equity for each of the two years in the period ended
December 31, 2017, and the related notes and our report
dated February 20, 2018 expressed an unqualified
opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting included in the
accompanying section 11.1, Management’s report on
internal control, of this Annual Report. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting
based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm
registered with the PCAOB and are required to be
independent with respect to the Company in
accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is
a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company’s internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of
the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being
made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (3)
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

February 20, 2018

We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, assessing the
risk that a material weakness exists, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
internal control based on the assessed risk, and

11.9 Notes
Notes to the Consolidated financial statements of
the Philips Group
Prior-period financial statements have been restated
for the treatment of the segment Lighting as a
discontinued operation (see note 3, Discontinued
operations and assets classified as held for sale).
Movement schedules of balance sheet items include
items from continuing and discontinued operations and
therefore cannot be reconciled to income from
continuing operations and cash flow from continuing
operations only.

Significant accounting policies
The Consolidated financial statements in the Group
financial statements section have been prepared in
accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) as endorsed by the European Union
(EU) and with the statutory provisions of Part 9, Book 2
of the Dutch Civil Code.
All standards and interpretations issued by the
International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and
the IFRS Interpretations Committee effective 2017 have
been endorsed by the EU; consequently, the
accounting policies applied by Koninklijke Philips N.V.
(hereafter: the ‘Company’ or ‘Philips’) also comply with
IFRS as issued by the IASB. These accounting policies
have been applied by group entities.
The Consolidated financial statements have been
prepared under the historical cost convention, unless
otherwise indicated.
The Consolidated financial statements are presented in
euros, which is the presentation currency. Due to
rounding, amounts may not add up precisely to totals
provided.
On February 20, 2018, the Board of Management
authorized the Consolidated financial statements for
issue. The Consolidated financial statements as
presented in this report are subject to adoption by the
Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, to be held on
May 3, 2018.

Use of estimates
The preparation of the Consolidated financial
statements in conformity with IFRS requires
management to make judgments, estimates and
assumptions that affect the application of accounting
policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
income and expenses. These estimates inherently
contain a degree of uncertainty. Actual results may
differ from these estimates under different assumptions
or conditions.
In the process of applying the accounting policies,
management has made estimates and assumptions
concerning the future and other key sources of
estimation uncertainty at the reporting date that have

Group financial statements 11.9

a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities within the
next financial year, as well as to the disclosure of
contingent liabilities at the date of the Consolidated
financial statements, and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
The Company evaluates these estimates and
judgments on an ongoing basis and bases the estimates
on historical experience, current and expected future
outcomes, third-party evaluations and various other
assumptions that Philips believes are reasonable under
the circumstances. Existing circumstances and
assumptions about future developments may change
due to circumstances beyond the Company’s control
and are reflected in the assumptions if and when they
occur. The results of these estimates form the basis for
making judgments about the carrying values of assets
and liabilities as well as identifying and assessing the
accounting treatment with respect to commitments and
contingencies. The Company revises material estimates
if changes occur in the circumstances or there is new
information or experience on which an estimate was or
can be based.
The areas where the most significant judgments and
estimates are made are goodwill, deferred tax asset
recoverability including assessment on valuation
adjustment following the enactment of the US Tax Cuts
and Jobs Act in December 2017, impairments, financial
instruments, the accounting for an arrangement
containing a lease, revenue recognition (multiple
element arrangements), tax risks and other
contingencies, assessment of control (including ‘de
facto’ control of Philips Lighting), classification of assets
and liabilities held for sale and the presentation of
items of profit and loss and cash flows as continued or
discontinued, as well as when determining the fair
values of acquired identifiable intangible assets and
investments based on an assessment of future cash
flows. For further discussion on these significant
judgements and estimates, reference is made to the
respective notes within these Consolidated financial
statements that relate to the above topics.
Further judgment is applied when analyzing
impairments of goodwill and intangible assets not yet
ready for use that are performed annually and
whenever a triggering event has occurred to determine
whether the carrying value exceeds the recoverable
amount. These analyses are generally based on
estimates of future cash flows. Furthermore, the
Company applies judgment when actuarial
assumptions are established to anticipate future events
that are used in calculating post-employment benefit
expenses and liabilities. These factors include
assumptions with respect to interest rates, rates of
increase in healthcare costs, rates of future
compensation increases, turnover rates and life
expectancy.

Changes 2015 and 2016
Accounting policies have been applied consistently for
all periods presented in these consolidated financial
statements, except for the items mentioned below. In
addition, certain prior-year amounts have been
reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
Changes processed in 2017 affecting 2016 and 2015
Tax adjustments
Two tax related adjustments were identified in 2017,
relating to tax expense understatements for years prior
to 2016. These adjustments affected the previously
issued financial statements for a number of years up to
and until December 31, 2015, including an impact on net
income of EUR 20 million in 2015 and EUR 55 million to
opening retained earnings in 2016.
If these adjustments had been processed in 2017, the
impact would have been material for 2017 and as such
the adjustments were processed in 2015 and 2016,
since it was concluded that the year-by-year
understatements were immaterial for the years up to
and including 2016.
Change in Balance Sheet presentation
Philips has changed the presentation of the
Consolidated balance sheets by removing certain
disaggregated line items and sub-totals, not affecting
the totals presented. Since this information is already
included in the relevant notes to the Consolidated
financial statements, the line items have been removed
to improve readability.
Change in Investments in associates presentation
In order to improve comparability and keep consistency
with peer practice, Philips has changed the
presentation of the line item Investments in associates
and moved it into the subtotal Income before taxes in
the Consolidated statements of income. This change
did not impact the results of operations or financial
position.
Change in Cash Flows presentation
IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and
Discontinued Operations requires that the net cash
flows attributable to the operating, investing and
financing activities of discontinued operations are
disclosed in the Consolidated financial statements of
Philips. These disclosures may be presented either in
the Consolidated statements of cash flows or in the
notes to the Consolidated financial statements. In order
to improve readability and enhance the focus of the
cash flow statement on the HealthTech cash flows, in
2017 Philips made the policy choice to disclose the net
cash provided by (used for) discontinued operations as
one line in the Consolidated statements of cash flows.
The breakdown of the operating, investing and
financing cash flow activities included in note 3,
Discontinued operations and assets classified as held
for sale.

Annual Report 2017

Changes processed in 2016 affecting 2015
Change in Segment reporting
In 2016, Philips established two stand-alone
companies focused on the HealthTech and Lighting
opportunities. As part of this separation, Philips
changed the way it allocated resources and analyzes
its performance based on the revised segment
structure. Accordingly, from 2016 the operational
reportable segments for the purpose of the disclosures
required by IFRS 8 Operating Segments were Personal
Health businesses, Diagnosis & Treatment businesses,
Connected Care & Health Informatics businesses and
Lighting, each being responsible for the management
of its business worldwide. Additionally, HealthTech
Other and Legacy Items are included in note 2,
Information by segment and main country. The new
segment structure had no impact on the cashgenerating units disclosed in note 11, Goodwill.
Consequential changes to comparative segment
disclosures were processed in note 14, Other assets,
note 16, Receivables, and note 19, Provisions. 2015
segment results have been reclassified according to the
revised reporting structure. Segment information can
be found in note 2, Information by segment and main
country.

Specific choices within IFRS
In certain instances IFRS allows alternative accounting
treatments for measurement and/or disclosure. Philips
has adopted one of the treatments as appropriate to
the circumstances of the Company. The most important
of these alternative treatments are mentioned below.
Tangible and intangible fixed assets
Under IFRS, an entity shall choose either the cost model
or the revaluation model as its accounting for tangible
and intangible fixed assets. In this respect, items of
property, plant and equipment are measured at cost
less accumulated depreciation and accumulated
impairment losses. The useful lives and residual values
are evaluated annually. Furthermore, the Company
chose to apply the cost model, meaning that costs
relating to product development, the development and
purchase of software for internal use and other
intangible assets are capitalized and subsequently
amortized over the estimated useful life. Further
information on Tangible and Intangible fixed assets can
be found in note 10, Property, plant and equipment and
note 12, Intangible assets excluding goodwill ,
respectively.
Employee benefit accounting
IFRS does not specify how an entity should present its
service costs related to pensions and net interest on the
net defined-benefit liability (asset) in the Statement of
income. With regards to these elements, the Company
presents service costs in Income from operations and
the net interest expenses related to defined-benefit
plans in Financial expense.

Group financial statements 11.9

Furthermore, when accounting for the settlement of
defined-benefit plans the Company made the
accounting policy choice to adjust the amount of the
plan assets transferred for the effect of the asset ceiling.
Further information on employee benefit accounting
can be found in note 20, Post-employment benefits.
Cash flow statements
Under IFRS, an entity shall report cash flows from
operating activities using either the direct method
(whereby major classes of gross cash receipts and gross
cash payments are disclosed) or the indirect method
(whereby profit or loss is adjusted for the effects of
transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals or
accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or
payments, and items of income or expense associated
with investing or financing cash flows). In this respect,
the Company chose to prepare the cash flow
statements using the indirect method.
Furthermore, interest cash flows are presented in cash
flows from operating activities rather than in cash flows
from financing or investing activities, because they
enter into the determination of profit or loss. The
Company chose to present dividends paid to
shareholders of Koninklijke Philips N.V. as a component
of cash flows from financing activities, rather than to
present such dividends as cash flows from operating
activities, which is an allowed alternative under IFRS.
Consolidated statements of cash flows can be found in
section 11.7, Consolidated statements of cash flows, of
this Annual Report.

Policies that are more critical in nature
Revenue recognition
Revenue from the sale of goods in the course of the
ordinary activities is measured at the fair value of the
consideration received or receivable, net of returns,
trade discounts and volume rebates. Revenue for sale
of goods is recognized when the significant risks and
rewards of ownership have been transferred to the
buyer, recovery of the consideration is probable, the
associated costs and possible return of the goods can
be estimated reliably, there is no continuing
involvement with goods, and the amount of revenue
can be measured reliably. If it is probable that discounts
will be granted and the amount can be measured
reliably, then the discount is recognized as a reduction
of revenue as the sales are recognized.
Transfer of risks and rewards varies depending on the
individual terms of the contract of sale. For consumertype products in the segment of Personal Health
businesses these criteria are met at the time the product
is shipped and delivered to the customer and title and
risk have passed to the customer (depending on the
delivery conditions) and acceptance of the product has
been obtained. Examples of delivery conditions are
‘Free on Board point of delivery’ and ‘Costs, Insurance

Paid point of delivery’, where the point of delivery may
be the shipping warehouse or any other point of
destination as agreed in the contract with the customer
and where title and risk for the goods pass to the
customer.
Revenues of transactions that have separately
identifiable components are recognized based on their
relative fair values. These transactions mainly occur in
the segments Diagnosis & Treatment businesses and
Connected Care & Health Informatics businesses and
include arrangements that require subsequent
installation and training activities in order to become
operable for the customer. Revenue recognition is
deferred until the installation has been completed and
the product is ready to be used by the customer in the
way contractually agreed.
Revenues are recorded net of sales taxes, customer
discounts, rebates and similar charges. For products for
which a right of return exists during a defined period,
revenue recognition is determined based on the
historical pattern of actual returns, or in cases where
such information is not available, revenue recognition
is postponed until the return period has lapsed. Return
policies are typically based on customary return
arrangements in local markets.
In the case of loss under a sales agreement, the loss is
recognized immediately.
Expenses incurred for shipping and handling of internal
movements of goods are recorded as cost of sales.
Shipping and handling related to sales to third parties
are recorded as selling expenses. When shipping and
handling is part of a project and billed to the customer,
then the related expenses are recorded as cost of sales.
Shipping and handling billed to customers is
recognized as revenues. Service revenue related to
repair and maintenance activities for goods sold is
recognized ratably over the service period or as services
are rendered.
A provision for product warranty is made at the time of
revenue recognition and reflects the estimated costs of
replacement and free-of-charge services that will be
incurred by the Company with respect to the products.
For certain products, the customer has the option to
purchase an extension of the warranty, which is
subsequently billed to the customer. Revenue
recognition occurs on a straight-line basis over the
extended warranty contract period.
Revenue from services is recognized when the
Company can reliably measure the amount of revenue
and the associated cost related to the stage of
completion of a contract or transaction, and the
recovery of the consideration is considered probable.
Royalty income from intellectual property rights, which
is generally earned based upon a percentage of sales
or a fixed amount per product sold, is recognized on an
accrual basis based on actual or reliably estimated

Annual Report 2017

109

Group financial statements 11.9

sales made by a licensee. Royalty income from an
agreement with lump-sum consideration is recognized
on accrual basis based on the contractual terms and
substance of the relevant agreement with a licensee.

same taxable entity or on different taxable entities, but
they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on
a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be
realized simultaneously.

Grants from governments are recognized at their fair
value where there is a reasonable assurance that the
grant will be received and the Company will comply
with all attached conditions. Government grants
relating to costs are deferred and recognized in the
Statement of income as a reduction of the related costs
over the period necessary to match them with the costs
that they are intended to compensate. Grants related
to assets are deducted from the cost of the asset and
presented net in the section 11.6, Consolidated balance
sheets, of this Annual Report.

A deferred tax asset is recognized for unused tax losses,
tax credits and deductible temporary differences, to the
extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will
be available against which they can be utilized. The
ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent
upon the generation of future taxable income in the
countries where the deferred tax assets originated and
during the periods when the deferred tax assets
become deductible. Management considers the
scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected
future taxable income and tax planning strategies in
making this assessment.

Income taxes
Income taxes comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognized in the Statement of income
except to the extent that it relates to items recognized
directly within equity or in other comprehensive
income. Current tax is the expected taxes payable on
the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted
or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any
adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Tax liabilities are recognized when it is considered
probable that there will be a future outflow of funds to
a taxing authority. In such cases, provision is made for
the amount that is expected to be settled, where this
can be reasonably estimated. This assessment relies on
estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of
judgments about future events. New information may
become available that causes the Company to change
its judgment regarding the adequacy of existing tax
liabilities. Such changes to tax liabilities will impact the
income tax expense in the period that such a
determination is made.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized, using
the balance sheet method, for the expected tax
consequences of temporary differences between the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and the
amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not
recognized for the following temporary differences: the
initial recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of
assets and liabilities in a transaction that is not a
business combination and that affects neither
accounting nor taxable profit; and differences relating
to investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and
associates where the reversal of the respective
temporary difference can be controlled by the
Company and it is probable that it will not reverse in the
foreseeable future. Deferred taxes are measured at the
tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary
differences when they reverse, based on the laws that
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the
reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset
current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to
income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the

110

Annual Report 2017

Deferred tax liabilities for withholding taxes are
recognized for subsidiaries in situations where the
income is to be paid out as dividend in the foreseeable
future and for undistributed earnings of unconsolidated
companies to the extent that these withholding taxes
are not expected to be refundable or deductible.
Changes in tax rates and tax laws are reflected in the
period when the change has been enacted or
substantively enacted by the reporting date.
Any subsequent adjustment to a tax asset or liability
that originated in discontinued operations, due to a
change in the tax base or its measurement, is allocated
to discontinued operations (i.e. backwards tracing).
Examples are a tax rate change or change in retained
assets or liabilities directly relating to the discontinued
operation. Any subsequent change to the recognition
of deferred tax assets is allocated to the component in
which the taxable gain is or will be recognized. The
above principles are applied to the extent the
‘discontinued operations’ is sufficiently separable from
continuing operations.
Further information on income tax can be found in
note 8, Income taxes.
Provisions
Provisions are recognized if, as a result of a past event,
the Company has a present legal or constructive
obligation, the amount can be estimated reliably, and
it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will
be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are
measured at the present value of the expenditures
expected to be required to settle the obligation using a
pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market
assessments of the time value of money. The increase

Group financial statements 11.9

in the provision due to passage of time is recognized as
interest expense. The accounting and presentation for
some of the Company’s provisions is as follows:
• Product warranty – A provision for warranties is
recognized when the underlying products or services
are sold. The provision is based on historical warranty
data and a weighing of possible outcomes against
their associated probabilities.
• Environmental provisions – Measurement of
liabilities associated with environmental obligations
is based on current legal and constructive
requirements. Liabilities and expected insurance
recoveries, if any, are recorded separately. The
carrying amount of environmental liabilities is
regularly reviewed and adjusted for new facts and
changes in law.
• Restructuring-related provisions – The provision for
restructuring mainly relates to the estimated costs of
initiated restructurings, the most significant of which
have been approved by the Executive Committee,
and which generally involve the realignment of
certain parts of the industrial and commercial
organization. When such restructurings require
discontinuance and/or closure of lines of activities,
the anticipated costs of closure or discontinuance are
included in restructuring provisions. A liability is
recognized for those costs only when the Company
has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and
has raised a valid expectation with those affected
that it will carry out the restructuring by starting to
implement that plan or announcing its main features
to those affected by it. Before a provision is
established, the Company recognizes any
impairment loss on the assets associated with the
restructuring.
• Litigation provisions – In relation to legal claim
provisions and settlements, the relevant balances are
transferred to Other liabilities at the point the amount
and timing of cash outflows are no longer uncertain.
Settlements which are agreed for amounts in excess
of existing provisions are reflected as increases of
Other liabilities.
Further information on provisions can be found in
note 19, Provisions.
Goodwill
The measurement of goodwill at initial recognition is
described under Basis of consolidation note. Goodwill
is subsequently measured at cost less accumulated
impairment losses. Further information on goodwill can
also be found in note 11, Goodwill.
Intangible assets other than goodwill
Acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized
using the straight-line method over their estimated
useful life. The useful lives are evaluated annually.
Intangible assets are initially capitalized at cost, with
the exception of intangible assets acquired as part of a
business combination, which are capitalized at their
acquisition date fair value.

The Company expenses all research costs as incurred.
Expenditure on development activities, whereby
research findings are applied to a plan or design for the
production of new or substantially improved products
and processes, is capitalized as an intangible asset if
the product or process is technically and commercially
feasible, the Company has sufficient resources and the
intention to complete development and can measure
the attributable expenditure reliably.
The capitalized development expenditure comprises of
all directly attributable costs (including the cost of
materials and direct labor). Other development
expenditures and expenditures on research activities
are recognized in the Statement of income. Capitalized
development expenditure is stated at cost less
accumulated amortization and impairment losses.
Amortization of capitalized development expenditure
is charged to the Statement of income on a straight-line
basis over the estimated useful lives of the intangible
assets.
Further information on intangible assets other than
goodwill can be found in note 12, Intangible assets
excluding goodwill.
Discontinued operations and non-current assets held
for sale
Non-current assets and disposal groups comprising
assets and liabilities that are expected to be recovered
primarily through sale rather than through continuing
use are classified as held for sale.
Non-current assets classified as held for sale and the
assets of a disposal group classified as held for sale are
presented separately from the other assets in the
balance sheet. The liabilities of a disposal group
classified as held for sale are presented separately from
other liabilities in the balance sheet.
A discontinued operation is a component of an entity
that either has been disposed of, or is classified as held
for sale, and represents a separate major line of
business or geographical area of operations; is a part of
a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate
major line of business or geographical area of
operations; or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with
a view to sell.
In case a discontinued operation is sold in stages as part
of a single coordinated plan until completely sold, then
the Investment in associate that is recognized upon sale
of a portion that results in Philips having significant
influence in the operation (rather than control), is
continued to be treated as discontinued operation
provided that the held for sale criteria are met.
Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued
operations are carried at the lower of carrying amount
or fair value less cost of disposal. Any gain or loss from
disposal, together with the results of these operations
until the date of disposal, is reported separately as

Annual Report 2017

111

Group financial statements 11.9

discontinued operations. The financial information of
discontinued operations is excluded from the
respective captions in the Consolidated financial
statements and related notes for all periods presented.
Comparatives in the balance sheet are not represented
when a non-current asset or disposal group is classified
as held for sale. Comparatives are represented for
presentation of discontinued operations in the
Statement of cash flow and Statement of income.
Adjustments in the current period to amounts
previously presented in discontinued operations that
are directly related to the disposal of a discontinued
operation in a prior period are classified separately in
Discontinued operations. Circumstances to which these
adjustments may relate include resolution of
uncertainties that arise from the terms of the disposal
transaction, such as the resolution of purchase price
adjustments and indemnifications, resolution of
uncertainties that arise from and are directly related to
the operations of the component before its disposal,
such as environmental and product warranty
obligations retained by the Company, or the settlement
of employee benefit plan obligations provided that the
settlement is directly related to the disposal
transaction.
Further information on discontinued operations and
non-current assets held for sale can be found in note 3,
Discontinued operations and assets classified as held
for sale.
Impairment
Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets not yet
ready for use
Goodwill and intangible assets not yet ready for use are
not amortized but tested for impairment annually and
whenever impairment indicators require. In case of
goodwill and intangible assets not yet ready for use,
either internal or external sources of information are
considered indicators that an asset or a CGU may be
impaired. In most cases the Company identified its
cash-generating units for goodwill at one level below
that of an operating segment. Cash flows at this level
are substantially independent from other cash flows
and this is the lowest level at which goodwill is
monitored by the Executive Committee. In 2017 the
Company performed and completed goodwill annual
impairment tests in the fourth quarter, in line with 2016.
In prior year, the Company also performed goodwill
annual impairment tests in the second quarter, which
was in line with 2015. An impairment loss is recognized
in the Statement of income whenever and to the extent
that the carrying amount of a cash-generating unit
exceeds the unit’s recoverable amount, which is the
greater of its value in use and fair value less cost of
disposal. Value in use is measured as the present value
of future cash flows expected to be generated by the
asset. Fair value less cost of disposal is measured as the
amount obtained from a sale of an asset in an arm’s
length transaction, less costs of disposal.

112

Annual Report 2017

Further information on impairment of goodwill and
intangible assets not yet ready for use can be found in
note 11, Goodwill and note 12, Intangible assets
excluding goodwill respectively.
Impairment of non-financial assets other than
goodwill, intangible assets not yet ready for use,
inventories and deferred tax assets
Non-financial assets other than goodwill, intangible
assets not yet ready for use, inventories and deferred
tax assets are reviewed for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
Recoverability of assets to be held and used is assessed
by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset with
the greater of its value in use and fair value less cost of
disposal. Value in use is measured as the present value
of future cash flows expected to be generated by the
asset. Fair value less cost of disposal is measured as the
amount obtained from a sale of an asset in an arm’s
length transaction, less costs of disposal. If the carrying
amount of an asset is deemed not recoverable, an
impairment charge is recognized in the amount by
which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the
recoverable amount. The review for impairment is
carried out at the level where cash flows occur that are
independent of other cash flows.
Impairment losses recognized in prior periods are
assessed at each reporting date for any indications that
the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An
impairment loss is reversed if and to the extent there
has been a change in the estimates used to determine
the recoverable amount. The loss is reversed only to the
extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not
exceed the carrying amount that would have been
determined, net of depreciation or amortization, if no
impairment loss had been recognized. Reversals of
impairment are recognized in the section 11.4,
Consolidated statements of income, of this Annual
Report.
Impairment of financial assets
A financial asset is considered to be impaired if
objective evidence indicates that one or more events
have had a negative effect on the estimated future cash
flows of that asset. In the case of available-for-sale
financial assets, a significant or prolonged decline in the
fair value of the financial asset below its cost is
considered an indicator that the financial assets are
impaired. If any such evidence exists for available-for
sale financial assets, the cumulative loss - measured as
the difference between the acquisition cost and the
current fair value, less any impairment loss on that
financial asset previously recognized in the Statement
of income - is reclassified from the fair value reserve in
equity (through Other comprehensive income) to the
Statement of income.
If objective evidence indicates that financial assets that
are carried at cost, such as loans and receivables, need
to be tested for impairment, calculations are based on

Group financial statements 11.9

information derived from business plans and other
information available for estimating their fair value,
which is based on estimated future cash flows
discounted at the asset’s original effective interest rate.
Any impairment loss is charged to the Statement of
income.
An impairment loss related to financial assets is
reversed if in a subsequent period the fair value
increases and the increase can be related objectively to
an event occurring after the impairment loss was
recognized. The loss is reversed only to the extent that
the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the
carrying amount that would have been determined if no
impairment loss had been recognized. Reversals of
impairment are recognized in the Statement of income
except for reversals of impairment of available-for-sale
equity securities, which are recognized in Other
comprehensive income.
Further information on financial assets can be found in
note 13, Other financial assets.

Other policies
Basis of consolidation
The Consolidated financial statements comprise the
financial statements of Koninklijke Philips N.V. and all
subsidiaries that the Company controls, i.e. when it is
exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its
involvement with the investee and has the ability to
affect those returns through its power over the investee.
Generally, there is a presumption that a majority of
voting rights results in control. To support this
presumption and when Philips has less than a majority
of the voting or similar rights of an investee, Philips
considers all relevant facts and circumstances in
assessing whether it has power over an investee,
including the contractual arrangement(s) with the other
vote holders of the investee, rights arising from other
contractual arrangements and the Company’s voting
rights and potential voting rights. Subsidiaries are fully
consolidated from the date that control commences
until the date that control ceases. All intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated in the
Consolidated financial statements. Unrealized losses
are eliminated in the same way as unrealized gains, but
only to the extent that there is no evidence of
impairment.
Loss of control
Upon the loss of control, the Company derecognizes
the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, any noncontrolling interests and the other components of
equity related to the subsidiary. Any surplus or deficit
arising on the loss of control is recognized in the
Statement of income. If the Company retains any
interest in the previous subsidiary, then such interest is
measured at fair value at the date the control is lost.
Subsequently it is accounted for as either an equity
accounted investee (associate) or as an available-forsale financial asset, depending on the level of influence

retained. Further information on loss of control can be
found in note 3, Discontinued operations and assets
classified as held for sale.
Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the
acquisition method. Under the acquisition method, the
identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any
non-controlling interest in the acquiree are recognized
at the acquisition date, which is the date on which
control is transferred to the Company.
The Company measures goodwill at the acquisition
date as:
• the fair value of the consideration transferred; plus
• the recognized amount of any non-controlling
interest in the acquiree; plus
• if the business combination is achieved in stages, the
fair value of the existing equity interest in the
acquiree; less
• the net recognized amount (generally fair value) of
the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities
assumed.
Costs related to the acquisition, other than those
associated with the issue of debt or equity securities,
that the Company incurs are expensed as incurred.
Any contingent consideration payable is recognized at
fair value at the acquisition date and initially is
presented in Long-term provisions. When the timing
and amount of the consideration become more certain,
it is reclassified to Accrued liabilities. If the contingent
consideration that meets the definition of a financial
instrument is classified as equity, it is not remeasured
and settlement is accounted for within equity.
Otherwise, subsequent changes to the fair value of the
contingent consideration are recognized in the
Statement of income.
Non-controlling interests are measured at their
proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net
assets at the date of acquisition.
Further information on business combinations can be
found in note 4, Acquisitions and divestments.
Acquisitions of and adjustments to non-controlling
interests
Acquisitions of non-controlling interests are accounted
for as transactions with owners in their capacity as
owners and therefore no goodwill is recognized.
Adjustments to non-controlling interests arising from
transactions that do not involve the loss of control are
based on a proportionate amount of the net assets of
the subsidiary.

Investments in associates (equity-accounted
investees)
Associates are all entities over which the Company has
significant influence, but no control. Significant
influence is presumed with a shareholding of between
20% and 50% of the voting rights. Investments in
associates are accounted for using the equity method
of accounting and are initially recognized at cost. The
carrying amount of an investment includes the carrying
amount of goodwill identified on acquisition. An
impairment loss on such investment is allocated to the
investment as a whole.
The Company’s share of the net income of these
companies is included in Investments in associates, net
of income taxes in the Statement of income, after
adjustments to align the accounting policies with those
of the Company, from the date that significant influence
commences until the date that significant influence
ceases. Dilution gains and losses arising from
investments in associates are recognized in the
Statement of income as part of Investments in
associates, net of income taxes. When the Company’s
share of losses exceeds its interest in an associate, the
carrying amount of that interest (including any longterm loans) is reduced to zero and recognition of further
losses is discontinued except to the extent that the
Company has incurred legal or constructive obligations
or made payments on behalf of the associate.
Unrealized gains on transactions between the
Company and its associates are eliminated to the
extent of the Company’s interest in the associates.
Unrealized losses are also eliminated unless the
transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the
asset transferred. Remeasurement differences of an
equity stake resulting from gaining control over the
investee previously recorded as associate are recorded
under Investments in associates.
Further information on investments in associates can
be found in note 5, Interests in entities .
Foreign currencies
Foreign currency transactions
The financial statements of all group entities are
measured using the currency of the primary economic
environment in which the entity operates (functional
currency). The euro (EUR) is the functional currency of
the Company and presentation currency of the Group
financial statements. Foreign currency transactions are
translated into the functional currency using the
exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the
transactions or valuation where items are remeasured.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the
settlement of such transactions and from the
translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies
are recognized in the Statement of income, except
when deferred in Other comprehensive income as
qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying net
investment hedges.

114

Annual Report 2017

Foreign currency differences arising from translations
are recognized in the Statement of income, except for
available-for-sale equity investments which are
recognized in Other comprehensive income. If there is
an impairment which results in foreign currency
differences being recognized, then these differences
are reclassified from Other comprehensive income to
the Statement of income.
All exchange difference items are presented as part of
Cost of sales, with the exception of tax items and
financial income and expense, which are recognized in
the same line item as they relate to in the Statement of
income.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in
foreign currencies that are measured at fair value are
retranslated to the functional currency using the
exchange rate at the date the fair value was
determined. Non-monetary items in a foreign currency
that are measured based on historical cost are
translated using the exchange rate at the transaction
date.
Foreign operations
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations,
including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on
acquisition, are translated to euros at exchange rates at
the reporting date. The income and expenses of foreign
operations are translated to euros at exchange rates at
the dates of the transactions.
Foreign currency differences arising on translation of
foreign operations into euros are recognized in Other
comprehensive income, and presented as part of
Currency translation differences in Equity. However, if
the operation is a non-wholly owned subsidiary, then
the relevant proportionate share of the translation
difference is allocated to Non-controlling interests.
When a foreign operation is disposed of such that
control, significant influence or joint control is lost, the
cumulative amount in the Currency translation
differences related to the foreign operation is
reclassified to the Statement of income as part of the
gain or loss on disposal. When the Company disposes
of only part of its interest in a subsidiary that includes
a foreign operation while retaining control, the
respective proportion of the cumulative amount is
reattributed to Non-controlling interests. When the
Company disposes of only part of its investment in an
associate or joint venture that includes a foreign
operation while retaining significant influence or joint
control, the relevant proportion of the cumulative
amount is reclassified to the Statement of income.
Financial instruments
Non-derivative financial instruments
Non-derivative financial instruments are recognized
initially at fair value when the Company becomes a
party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

Group financial statements 11.9

Purchases and sales of financial assets in the normal
course of business are accounted for at the trade date.
Dividend and interest income are recognized when
earned. Gains or losses, if any, are recorded in Financial
income and expense.
Non-derivative financial instruments comprise cash
and cash equivalents, receivables, other non-current
financial assets, debt and other financial liabilities that
are not designated as hedges.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include all cash balances,
money market funds and short-term highly liquid
investments with an original maturity of three months
or less that are readily convertible into known amounts
of cash.
Further information on cash and cash equivalents can
be found in note 23, Cash flow statement
supplementary information.
Receivables
Receivables are carried at the lower of amortized cost
or the present value of estimated future cash flows,
taking into account discounts given or agreed. The
present value of estimated future cash flows is
determined through the use of value adjustments for
uncollectible amounts. As soon as individual trade
accounts receivable can no longer be collected in the
normal way and are expected to result in a loss, they
are designated as doubtful trade accounts receivable
and valued at the expected collectible amounts. They
are written off when they are deemed to be
uncollectible because of bankruptcy or other forms of
receivership of the debtors. The allowance for the risk
of non-collection of trade accounts receivable takes
into account credit-risk concentration, collective debt
risk based on average historical losses, and specific
circumstances such as serious adverse economic
conditions in a specific country or region.
The Company derecognizes receivables on entering
into factoring transactions if the Company has
transferred substantially all risks and rewards or if
Philips does not retain control over receivables.
Further information on receivables can be found in
note 16, Receivables.
Other non-current financial assets
Other non-current financial assets include held-tomaturity investments, loans receivable and availablefor-sale financial assets and financial assets at fair
value through profit or loss.
Held-to-maturity investments are those debt securities
which the Company has the ability and intent to hold
until maturity. Held-to-maturity debt investments are
recorded at amortized cost, adjusted for the
amortization or accretion of premiums or discounts
using the effective interest method.

Loans receivable are stated at amortized cost, less
impairment.
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative
financial assets that are designated as available-forsale and that are not classified in any of the other
categories of financial assets. Subsequent to initial
recognition, they are measured at fair value and
changes therein, other than impairment losses and
foreign currency differences on available-for-sale debt
instruments, are recognized in Other comprehensive
income and presented in the fair value reserve in equity.
When an investment is derecognized, the gain or loss
accumulated in equity is reclassified to the Statement
of income.
Available-for-sale financial assets including
investments in privately-held companies that are not
associates, and do not have a quoted market price in
an active market and whose fair value could not be
reliably determined, are carried at cost.
A financial asset is classified as fair value through profit
or loss if it is classified as held for trading or is
designated as such upon initial recognition. Financial
assets are designated as fair value through profit or loss
if the Company manages such investments and makes
purchase and sale decisions based on their fair value in
accordance with the Company’s documented risk
management or investment strategy. Financial assets at
fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair
value, and changes therein are recognized in the
Statement of income. Attributable transaction costs are
recognized in the Statement of income as incurred.
Further information on other non-current financial
assets can be found in note 13, Other financial assets.
Equity
Common shares are classified as equity. Incremental
costs directly attributable to the issuance of shares are
recognized as a deduction from equity. Where the
Company purchases the Company’s equity share
capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid,
including any directly attributable incremental
transaction costs (net of income taxes), is deducted
from equity attributable to the Company’s equity
holders until the shares are cancelled or reissued.
Where such ordinary shares are subsequently reissued,
any consideration received, net of any directly
attributable incremental transaction costs and the
related income tax effects, is included in equity
attributable to the Company’s equity holders.
Call options on own shares are treated as equity
instruments.
Dividends are recognized as a liability in the period in
which they are declared and approved by
Shareholders. The income tax consequences of
dividends are recognized when a liability to pay the
dividend is recognized.

Annual Report 2017

115

Group financial statements 11.9

Further information on equity can be found in note 17,
Equity.
Debt and other liabilities
Debt and liabilities other than provisions are stated at
amortized cost.
Derivative financial instruments, including hedge
accounting
The Company uses derivative financial instruments
principally to manage its foreign currency risks and, to
a more limited extent, for managing interest rate and
commodity price risks. All derivative financial
instruments are accounted for at the trade date and
classified as current or non-current assets or liabilities
based on the maturity date or the earlier termination
date. Embedded derivatives are separated from the
host contract and accounted for separately if the
economic characteristics and risks of the host contract
and the embedded derivative are not closely related.
The Company measures all derivative financial
instruments at fair value derived from market prices of
the instruments, or calculated as the present value of
the estimated future cash flows based on observable
interest yield curves, basis spread, credit spreads and
foreign exchange rates, or from option pricing models,
as appropriate. Gains or losses arising from changes in
fair value of derivatives are recognized in the Statement
of income, except for derivatives that are highly
effective and qualify for cash flow or net investment
hedge accounting.
Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly
effective and that is designated and qualifies as a cash
flow hedge are recorded in Other comprehensive
income until the Statement of income is affected by the
variability in cash flows of the designated hedged item.
To the extent that the hedge is ineffective, changes in
the fair value are recognized in the Statement of
income.
The Company formally assesses, both at the hedge’s
inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the
derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are
highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or
cash flows of hedged items. When it is established that
a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge or that it
has ceased to be a highly effective hedge, the Company
discontinues hedge accounting prospectively. When
hedge accounting is discontinued because it is
expected that a forecasted transaction will not occur,
the Company continues to carry the derivative on the
Balance sheet at its fair value, and gains and losses that
were accumulated in Other comprehensive income are
recognized immediately in the same line item as they
relate to in the Statement of income.
Foreign currency differences arising on the
retranslation of financial instruments designated as a
hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation are
recognized directly as a separate component of equity
through Other comprehensive income, to the extent

116

Annual Report 2017

that the hedge is effective. To the extent that the hedge
is ineffective, such differences are recognized in the
Statement of income.
Offsetting and master netting agreements
The Company presents financial assets and financial
liabilities on a gross basis as separate line items in the
Consolidated balance sheet.
Master netting agreements may be entered into when
the Company undertakes a number of financial
instrument transactions with a single counterparty.
Such an agreement provides for a net settlement of all
financial instruments covered by the agreement in the
event of default or certain termination events on any of
the transactions. A master netting agreement may
create a right of offset that becomes enforceable and
affects the realization or settlement of individual
financial assets and financial liabilities only following a
specified termination event. However, if this contractual
right is subject to certain limitations then it does not
necessarily provide a basis for offsetting unless both of
the offsetting criteria are met, i.e. there is a legally
enforceable right and an intention to settle net or
simultaneously.
Property, plant and equipment
The costs of property, plant and equipment comprise
all directly attributable costs (including the cost of
material and direct labor).
Depreciation is generally calculated using the straightline method over the useful life of the asset. Gains and
losses on the sale of property, plant and equipment are
included in Other Business Income. Costs related to
repair and maintenance activities are expensed in the
period in which they are incurred unless leading to an
extension of the original lifetime or capacity.
Plant and equipment under finance leases and
leasehold improvements are amortized using the
straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term
or the estimated useful life of the asset. The gain
realized on sale and operating leaseback transactions
that are concluded based upon market conditions is
recognized at the time of the sale in Other Business
Income, in the Consolidated statements of income.
Further information on property, plant and equipment
can be found in note 10, Property, plant and equipment.
Leased assets
Leases in which the Company is the lessee and has
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are
classified as finance leases. Finance leases are
capitalized at the commencement of the lease at the
lower of the fair value of the leased assets and the
present value of the minimum lease payments. Each
lease payment is allocated between the liability and
finance charges. The interest element of the finance
cost is charged to the Statement of income over the
lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate

Group financial statements 11.9

of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for
each period. The corresponding rental obligations, net
of finance charges, are included in other short-term and
other non-current liabilities. The property, plant and
equipment acquired under finance leases is
depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the
assets and the lease term.
Leases in which the Company is the lessee and in which
substantially all risks and rewards of ownership are
retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases (net of any
incentives received from the lessor) are recognized in
the Statement of income on a straight-line basis over
the term of the lease.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net
realizable value. The cost of inventories comprises all
costs of purchase, costs of conversion and other costs
incurred in bringing the inventories to their present
location and condition. The costs of conversion of
inventories include direct labor and fixed and variable
production overheads, taking into account the stage of
completion and the normal capacity of production
facilities. Costs of idle facility and abnormal waste are
expensed. The cost of inventories is determined using
the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Inventory is
reduced for the estimated losses due to obsolescence.
This reduction is determined for groups of products
based on sales in the recent past and/or expected
future demand.
Further information on inventories can be found in
note 15, Inventories.
Employee benefit accounting
A defined-contribution plan is a post-employment
benefit plan under which an entity pays fixed
contributions into a separate entity and will have no
legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts.
Obligations for contributions to defined-contribution
pension plans are recognized as an employee benefit
expense in the Statement of income in the periods
during which services are rendered by employees.
A defined-benefit plan is a post-employment benefit
plan other than a defined-contribution plan. Plans for
which the Company has no legal or constructive
obligation to pay further amounts, but to which it does
pay non-fixed contributions, are also treated as a
defined-benefit plan. The net pension asset or liability
recognized in the Consolidated balance sheets in
respect of defined-benefit post-employment plans is
the fair value of plan assets less the present value of the
projected defined-benefit obligation at the balance
sheet date. The defined-benefit obligation is calculated
annually by qualified actuaries using the projected unit
credit method. Recognized assets are limited to the
present value of any reductions in future contributions

or any future refunds. The net pension liability is
presented as a long-term provision, no distinction is
made for the short-term portion.
For the Company’s major plans, a full discount rate
curve of high-quality corporate bonds is used to
determine the defined-benefit obligation. The curves
are based on Towers Watson’s rate methodology which
uses data of corporate bonds rated AA or equivalent.
For the other plans a single point discount rate is used
based on corporate bonds for which there is a deep
market and the plan’s maturity. Plans in countries
without a deep corporate bond market use a discount
rate based on the local sovereign curve and the plan’s
maturity.
Pension costs in respect of defined-benefit postemployment plans primarily represent the increase of
the actuarial present value of the obligation for postemployment benefits based on employee service
during the year and the interest on the net recognized
asset or liability in respect of employee service in
previous years.
Remeasurements of the net defined-benefit asset or
liability comprise actuarial gains and losses, the return
on plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect of the
asset ceiling (excluding interest). The Company
recognizes all remeasurements in Other
comprehensive income.
The Company recognizes gains and losses on the
settlement of a defined-benefit plan when the
settlement occurs. The gain or loss on settlement is the
difference between the present value of the definedbenefit obligation being settled, as determined on the
date of settlement, and the settlement price, including
any plan assets transferred and any payments made
directly by the Company in connection with the
settlement. In this respect, the amount of the plan
assets transferred is adjusted for the effect of the asset
ceiling. Past service costs following from the
introduction of a change to the benefit payable under
a plan or a significant reduction of the number of
employees covered by a plan (curtailment), are
recognized in full in the Statement of income.
Further information on post-employment benefit
accounting can be found in note 20, Post-employment
benefits.
Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured
on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the
related service is provided. The Company recognizes a
liability and an expense for bonuses and incentives
based on a formula that takes into consideration the
profit attributable to the Company’s shareholders after
certain adjustments.
The Company’s net obligation in respect of long-term
employee benefits is the amount of future benefit that
employees have earned in return for their service in the

Annual Report 2017

117

Group financial statements 11.9

current and prior periods, such as jubilee entitlements.
That benefit is discounted to determine its present
value. Remeasurements are recognized in the
Statement of income in the period in which they arise.
Further information on other employee benefits can be
found in note 19, Provisions under Other provisions
section.
Share-based payment
Equity-settled transactions
The cost of equity-settled transactions is determined
by the fair value at the date when the grant is made
using an appropriate valuation model, further details of
which are given in note 26, Share-based compensation.
The grant-date fair value of equity-settled sharebased payment awards granted to employees is
recognized as personnel expense, with a
corresponding increase in equity, over the vesting
period of the award. The cumulative expense
recognized for equity-settled transactions at each
reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent
to which the vesting period has expired and the
Company’s best estimate of the number of equity
instruments that will ultimately vest. The expense or
credit in the statement of profit or loss for a period
represents the movement in cumulative expense
recognized as at the beginning and end of that period.
Service and non-market performance conditions are
not taken into account when determining the grantdate fair value of awards, but the likelihood of the
conditions being met is assessed as part of the
Company’s best estimate of the number of equity
instruments that will ultimately vest. Market
performance conditions are reflected within the grantdate fair value. No expense is recognized for awards
that do not ultimately vest because non-market
performance and/or service conditions have not been
met.
When an award is cancelled by the entity or by the
counterparty, any remaining element of the fair value
of the award is expensed immediately through profit or
loss. The dilutive effect of outstanding options and
shares is reflected as additional share dilution in the
computation of diluted earnings per share (further
details are given in note 9, Earnings per share).
Financial income and expenses
Financial income comprises interest income on funds
invested (including available-for-sale financial assets),
dividend income, net gains on the disposal of availablefor-sale financial assets, net fair value gains on financial
assets at fair value through profit or loss, net gains on
the remeasurement to fair value of any preexisting
available-for-sale interest in an acquiree, and net gains
on foreign exchange impacts that are recognized in the
Statement of income.

118

Annual Report 2017

Interest income is recognized on accrual basis in the
Statement of income, using the effective interest
method. Dividend income is recognized in the
Statement of income on the date that the Company’s
right to receive payment is established, which in the
case of quoted securities is normally the ex-dividend
date.
Financial expenses comprise interest expenses on
borrowings, unwinding of the discount on provisions
and contingent consideration, losses on disposal of
available-for-sale financial assets, net fair value losses
on financial assets at fair value through profit or loss,
impairment losses recognized on financial assets (other
than trade receivables), net interest expenses related
to defined-benefit plans and net losses on foreign
exchange impacts that are recognized in the Statement
of income.
Further information on financial income and expenses
can be found in note 7, Financial income and expenses.
Financial guarantees
The Company recognizes a liability at the fair value of
the obligation at the inception of a financial guarantee
contract if it is probable that an outflow of resources
embodying economic benefits will be required to settle
the obligation. The guarantee is subsequently
measured at the higher of the best estimate of the
obligation or the amount initially recognized less, when
appropriate, cumulative amortization.
Cash flow statements
Cash flows arising from transactions in a foreign
currency are translated in the Company’s functional
currency using the exchange rate at the date of the cash
flow. Cash flows from derivative instruments that are
accounted for as cash flow hedges are classified in the
same category as the cash flows from the hedged items.
Cash flows from other derivative instruments are
classified as investing cash flows.
Segment information
Operating segments are components of the Company’s
business activities about which separate financial
information is available that is evaluated regularly by
the chief operating decision maker (the Executive
Committee of the Company). The Executive Committee
decides how to allocate resources and assesses
performance. Reportable segments comprise the
operating segments Personal Health businesses,
Diagnosis & Treatment businesses and Connected Care
& Health Informatics businesses. Additionally, Philips
identifies HealthTech Other and Legacy Items. Segment
accounting policies are the same as the accounting
policies applied by the Company.
Earnings per Share
The Company presents basic and diluted earnings per
share (EPS) data for its common shares. Basic EPS is
calculated by dividing the Net income (loss)
attributable to shareholders by the weighted average

Group financial statements 11.9

number of common shares outstanding during the
period, adjusted for own shares held. Diluted EPS is
determined by adjusting the Net income (loss)
attributable to shareholders and the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding during the
period, adjusted for own shares held, for the effects of
all dilutive potential common shares, which comprises
forward purchase contracts entered into in 2017,
restricted shares, performance shares and share
options granted to employees.
Further information on earnings per share can be found
in note 9, Earnings per share.

New standards and interpretations
IFRS accounting standards adopted as from 2017
Changes to policies, following from amendments to
standards, interpretations and the annual improvement
cycles, effective 2017, did not have a material impact on
the Group financial statements.
IFRS accounting standards to be adopted as from
2018 and onwards
A number of new standards and amendments to
existing standards have been published and are
mandatory for the Company beginning on or after
January 1, 2018 or later periods, and the Company has
not early-adopted them. Those which may be the most
relevant to the Company are set out below. Changes to
other standards, following from amendments and the
annual improvement cycles, are not expected to have
a material impact on the Company’s financial
statements.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments brings together the
classification and measurement, impairment and hedge
accounting phases of the IASB’s project to replace IAS
39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and
Measurement.
The new standard also introduces expanded disclosure
requirements to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments:
Disclosures and changes in presentation to IAS 1
Presentation of Financial Statements. These are
expected to change the nature and extent of the
Company’s disclosures about its financial instruments
particularly in the year of the adoption of the new
standard.
The Company finalized the implementation of IFRS 9,
except for the determination of the final IFRS 7
disclosures to be included in the Annual Report for
2018. These will be finalized in the coming year. The
Company will adopt the new standard on the required
effective date and will not restate comparative
information. During 2017, Philips performed a detailed
impact assessment of all three aspects of IFRS 9.
Overall, the Company expects no significant impact on
its statement of financial position and equity.

Classification and measurement
The Company noted no significant impact on its
balance sheet or equity on applying the classification
and measurement requirements of IFRS 9. The
investments in equity shares are currently classified as
available-for-sale financial assets with gains and losses
recorded in other comprehensive income. Upon
adopting IFRS 9, certain financial investments
amounting to EUR 21 million (impact on Company
financial statements is EUR 14 million) will change
classification and measurement from Other
comprehensive income to Fair value through profit or
loss (FVPL). The related fair value gains of EUR 5 million
(impact on Company financial statements is EUR 5
million) will be transferred from the available-for-sale
financial assets reserve to Retained earnings on
January 1, 2018.
The remaining available-for-sale equity investments
amounting to EUR 396 million (impact on Company
financial statements is EUR 130 million) will continue to
be measured at fair value through Other
comprehensive income as the Company has chosen
the fair value through other comprehensive income
(FVOCI) election for such investments. Accordingly, the
new guidance will not affect the classification and
measurement of these financial assets. However, gains
or losses realized on the sale of financial assets at
FVOCI will no longer be transferred to profit or loss on
sale, but instead reclassified below the line from the
FVOCI reserve to Retained earnings.
The debt investments of the Company amounting to
EUR 29 million (impact on Company financial
statements is nil) that are currently classified as
available-for-sale will satisfy the conditions for
classification as at FVOCI and hence there will be no
change to the accounting for these assets.
The Company has debt investment amounting to EUR
0.6 million (impact on Company financial statements is
nil) currently classified as held-to-maturity and
measured at amortized cost which meets the
conditions for classification at amortized cost under
IFRS 9.
Loans as well as trade receivables are held to collect
contractual cash flows and are expected to give rise to
cash flows representing solely payments of principal
and interest. The Company analyzed the contractual
cash flow characteristics of those instruments and
concluded that they meet the criteria for amortized cost
measurement under IFRS 9. Therefore, reclassification
for these instruments is not required except for
receivables which are factored. The business model for
such factored receivables amounting to EUR 48 million
(impact on Company financial statements is nil) is hold
to collect and sell and hence they will be booked at
FVOCI.

Annual Report 2017

119

Group financial statements 11.9

There will be no impact on the Company’s accounting
for financial liabilities, as the new requirements only
affect the accounting for financial liabilities that are
designated at fair value through profit or loss, and the
Company does not have any such liabilities. The
derecognition rules have been transferred from IAS 39
Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement
and have not been changed.
Impairment
The new impairment model requires the recognition of
impairment provisions based on expected credit losses
(ECL) rather than only incurred credit losses as is the
case under IAS 39. The expected credit losses include
forward-looking elements on all possible default
events as well as historical loss data. It applies to
financial assets classified at amortized cost, debt
instruments measured at FVOCI, contract assets under
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, lease
receivables, loan commitments and certain financial
guarantee contracts. The Company will apply the
simplified approach and record lifetime-expected
losses on all trade receivables. Based on the
assessments undertaken to date, the Company expects
no material increase in the loss allowance for debt
investments and financial assets held at amortized cost.
Additionally the Company also assessed the impact of
the new impairment model on its intercompany
financial assets (including receivables) recognized in
the Company financial statements and concluded that
there is no material increase in the loss allowance.
Hedge accounting
The Company has completed updates to its internal
documentation and monitoring processes and
concluded that all existing hedge relationships that are
currently designated in effective hedging relationships
will continue to qualify for hedge accounting under
IFRS 9. Changes in the fair value of foreign exchange
forward contracts attributable to forward points and in
the time value of the option contracts will in future be
deferred in costs of hedging reserve within equity. The
deferred amounts will be recognized against the
related hedged transaction when it occurs.
The Company has chosen not to retrospectively apply
IFRS 9 on transition regarding the forward points of the
forward contracts under IAS 39. As IFRS 9 does not
change the general principles of how an entity accounts
for effective hedges, applying the hedging
requirements of IFRS 9 will not have a significant impact
on Philips’ financial statements.
Transition
IFRS 9 must be applied for financial years commencing
on or after January 1, 2018 and it is fully endorsed by
the EU. The Company will apply the new rules
retrospectively from January 1, 2018, with the practical
expedients permitted under the standard.
Comparatives for 2017 will not be restated in 2018.

Annual Report 2017

IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
The IASB has issued a new standard that specifies how
and when revenue is recognized and prescribes more
informative and relevant disclosures. The standard
supersedes IAS 18 Revenue, IAS 11 Construction
Contracts and a number of revenue-related
interpretations.
The new standard provides a single, principles-based
five-step model to be applied to all contracts with
customers and is based on the principle that revenue is
recognized when control of a good or service transfers
to a customer. Furthermore, it provides new guidance
on whether revenue should be recognized at a point in
time or over time. The standard also introduces new
guidance on costs of fulfilling and obtaining a contract,
specifying the circumstances in which such costs
should be capitalized. Costs that do not meet the
criteria must be expensed when incurred.
The actions needed to implement IFRS 15 in the
organization have been finalized and the quantitative
impacts determined, except for the determination of
the final IFRS 15 disclosures to be included in the Annual
Report for 2018. These will be finalized in the coming
year. The following main impacted areas were
identified.
Royalty income
Currently the Company recognizes revenue from
intellectual property (IP) royalties, which is normally
generated based upon a percentage of sales or a fixed
amount per product sold, on an accrual basis based on
actual or reliably estimated sales made by the
licensees. Revenue generated from an agreement with
lump-sum consideration is recognized on accrual basis
based on the contractual terms and substance of the
relevant agreement with a licensee. Under IFRS 15,
revenues from the licensing of intellectual property
should be recognized based on a right to access the
intellectual property or a right to use the intellectual
property approach. Under the first option revenue is
recognized over time while under the second option
revenue is recognized at a point in time. As a result, this
will have an impact on revenues originating from the
Company’s IP royalties with lump-sum consideration
(within segment HealthTech Other) since under IFRS 15
such revenues will be recognized in the Statement of
income at an earlier point in time rather than over time
under the current methodology. An amount of EUR 34
million of deferred revenue will be recorded as an
increase in retained earnings upon transition and a
deferred tax asset of EUR 7 million will be released as
a consequence. The net impact in equity will be EUR 25
million.
Costs of obtaining a contract
Under IFRS 15, the incremental costs of obtaining a
contract with a customer are recognized as an asset if
the entity expects to recover them.

Group financial statements 11.9

The Company identified that certain sales commissions
paid to third parties and internal employees that are
typical for transactions in the segments Diagnosis &
Treatment businesses and Connected Care & Health
Informatics businesses qualify as incremental costs of
obtaining a contract. These costs are mostly paid and
capitalized as prepayment upon issuance of sales
orders and recognition of revenue related to the sale of
goods or rendering of services. Such costs are
commonly expensed in line with the revenue
recognition pattern of the related goods or services.
Due to these sales commissions being largely
amortized within a year, the Company decided to adopt
the practical expedient of expensing sales commissions
when incurred. An impact of EUR 68 million will be
recorded as a retained earnings decrease in equity
originating from the asset derecognition upon
transition, and a deferred tax liability of EUR 17 million
will be released as a consequence. The net impact in
equity will be EUR 51 million.
Transition
IFRS 15 must be applied for periods beginning on or
after January 1, 2018 and it is fully endorsed by the EU.
The Company decided to adopt IFRS 15 in its
consolidated financial statements for the year ending
December 31, 2018, using the modified retrospective
transition approach which means that the cumulative
impact of the adoption will be recognized in retained
earnings as of January 1, 2018 and that comparatives
will not be restated. The standard will only be applied
to contracts that are not completed as of the date of
initial application.

commitments of EUR 741 million (undiscounted) as
further explained in note 29, Details of treasury / other
financial risks. The Company plans to use the
recognition exemption for low-value leases such as IT
laptops and desktops and recognize on a straight line
basis as an expense in profit or loss.
Philips has not yet assessed what other adjustments, if
any, are necessary, such as following the change in the
definition of the lease term, the different treatment of
variable lease payments, and of extension and
termination options. It is therefore not yet possible to
estimate the amount of right-of-use assets and lease
liabilities that will have to be recognized on adoption of
the new standard and how this may affect the
Company’s profit or loss and classification of cash flows
going forward.
The standard is mandatory for financial years
commencing on or after January 1, 2019. The Company
decided not to adopt the standard before its effective
date. Philips intends to apply the modified
retrospective approach. Therefore, the cumulative
effect of adopting IFRS 16 will be recognized as an
adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings
at January 1, 2019, with no restatement of comparative
information. When applying the modified retrospective
approach to leases previously classified as operating
leases under IAS 17, the lessee can elect, on a lease by
lease basis whether to apply a number of practical
expedients on the transition. The Company is assessing
the potential impact of using these practical
expedients.

IFRS 16 Leases
IFRS 16 was issued in January 2016 and is endorsed by
the EU. It will supersede IAS 17 Leases and a number of
lease-related interpretations and will result in almost
all leases being recognized on the balance sheet, as the
distinction between operating and finance leases is
removed. Under the new standard, an asset (the right
to use the leased item) and a financial liability to pay
rentals are recognized. The only exceptions are shortterm and low-value leases.
The accounting for lessors will not change significantly.
The Company is in the process of implementing IFRS
16: the complete overview of existing operating lease
contracts was determined (mainly real estate and car
leases) and the investigation for an IT tool supporting
IFRS 16 calculations and journal entries is ongoing. The
new standard was discussed with management and
internal stakeholders such as Treasury, Investor
Relations and Human Resources so that they can work
on potential adjustments to their processes, if needed.
The Company is analyzing the preliminary quantitative
impact of IFRS 16.
The standard will affect primarily the accounting for the
Company’s operating leases. As at the reporting date,
Philips has non-cancellable operating lease

For reconciliation Adjusted EBITA, refer to the table below.

In 2016, Philips established two stand-alone
companies focused on the HealthTech and Lighting
opportunities. Following this separation, Philips
changed the way it allocates resources and analyzes its
performance based on a new segment structure.
Accordingly, from 2016 the reportable segments for the
purpose of the disclosures required by IFRS 8,
Operating Segments, are Personal Health, Diagnosis &
Treatment, and Connected Care & Health Informatics,
each being responsible for the management of its
business worldwide. Additionally, HealthTech Other
and Legacy Items are included. From 2017, Lighting is
reported as part of Discontinued Operations (refer to
note 3, Discontinued operations and assets classified as
held for sale).
Philips focuses on improving people’s lives through
meaningful innovation across the health continuum –
from healthy living and prevention to diagnosis,
treatment and home care. The Personal Health
businesses deliver integrated, connected solutions that
support healthier lifestyles and those living with chronic
disease. The Diagnosis & Treatment businesses deliver
precision medicine and least-invasive treatment and
therapy to improve outcomes, lower the cost of care
delivery and enhance the patient experience. The
Connected Care & Health Informatics businesses

122

7

Annual Report 2017

deliver digital solutions that facilitate value-based care
through consumer technology, patient monitoring and
clinical informatics.
The Executive Committee of Philips is deemed to be the
chief operating decision maker (CODM) for IFRS 8
segment reporting purposes. The key segmental
performance measure is Adjusted EBITA, which
Management believes is the most relevant measure to
evaluate the results of the segments.
The term Adjusted EBITA is used to evaluate the
performance of Philips and its segments. EBITA
represents Income from operations excluding
amortization and impairment of acquired intangible
assets and impairment of goodwill. Adjusted EBITA
represents EBITA excluding gains or losses from
restructuring costs, acquisition-related charges and
other items.
Adjusted EBITA is not a recognized measure of financial
performance under IFRS. Below is a reconciliation of
Adjusted EBITA to the most directly comparable IFRS
measure, Net income, for the years indicated. Net
income is not allocated to segments as certain income

Lighting
In the course of 2017, Philips completed several
transactions in Philips Lighting shares, which reduced
the interest in this company from 71.23% as of
December 31, 2016 to 29.01% as of December 31, 2017.
For further details, please refer to note 5, Interests in
entities.
On April 28, 2017, triggered by a sale of Philips Lighting
shares, we concluded that a loss of control was highly
probable due to further sell-downs of shares within one
year. From that date Lighting was presented as a
discontinued operation.
On November 28, 2017, triggered by an additional sale
of Philips Lighting shares, Philips lost control, resulting
in the deconsolidation of Philips Lighting. Upon
deconsolidation, the Company recognized a gain of
EUR 599 million, including a tax benefit of EUR 61
million, which was recorded in Discontinued
operations. This gain is the net effect of (i) a cash
consideration for shares sold in this transaction

Group financial statements 11.9

(EUR 545 million) (ii) plus the fair value of the retained
number of shares (EUR 1,368 million) (iii) less the assets
held for sale and the liabilities associated with assets
held for sale (EUR 2,513 million net) (iv) plus the carrying
amount of Non-controlling interest related to Philips
Lighting (EUR 1,481 million) and (v) less the release of
balances accumulated in Other comprehensive
income, mainly relating to currency translation
differences (EUR 282 million).
In determining the EUR 599 million, a gain of EUR 638
million was attributable to measuring the retained
interest at its fair value.
In addition, Philips recognized a valuation loss of EUR
104 million related to the retained interest in Philips
Lighting subsequent to deconsolidation (see other
assets classified as assets held for sale in this
paragraph).
The following table, summarizes the results of Lighting
included in the Consolidated statements of income as

tax benefit (EUR 26 million), (iv) less the book value of
business-related assets and liabilities (EUR 1,533

translation differences (EUR 63 million). Furthermore, a
gain related to the sale of real estate was recognized in
Other business income in Q1 2017. In addition,
trademark license revenue is recognized in income from
continuing operations as of December 2017.
In determining the EUR 72 million, a gain of EUR 13

interest at its fair value.

As a result of Lighting being classified as a discontinued
operation, the 2015 and 2016 financial statements have
been restated. Apart from these changes,
consequential restatements were processed in note 6,
Income from operations, note 7, Financial income and

Discontinued operations: Combined Lumileds and
Automotive businesses
On June 30, 2017, Philips completed the sale of an
80.1% interest in the combined Lumileds and
Automotive businesses to certain funds managed by
affiliates of Apollo Global Management, LLC.
The combined businesses of Lumileds and Automotive
were reported as discontinued operations as from the
end of November 2014.
During 2017, discontinued operations results of the
combined businesses of Lumileds and Automotive
amounted to a loss of EUR 29 million, which consisted

of EUR 1 million).
The main result in 2016 related to the court decision in
favor of Philips in an arbitration case against Funai
Electric Co., Ltd. Philips started the arbitration after it
terminated the agreement to transfer the Audio, Video,
Media & Accessories business to Funai following a
breach of contract by Funai. As a consequence the
court ordered Funai to pay EUR 144 million, which

includes disbursements and interest, as compensation
for damages. The amount was received in the second

In 2017, cash flows from operating activities reflect the
period prior to the divestment of the combined
Lumileds and Automotive business (six months of cash
flows) and prior to the deconsolidation of Lighting
(eleven months of cash flows). In 2017, cash flows from
investing activities includes the net cash outflow related
to the deconsolidation of Philips Lighting of EUR 175
million, consisting of EUR 545 million proceeds from the
sale of shares on November 28, 2017, offset by the
deconsolidation of EUR 720 million of cash and cash
equivalents, and proceeds of EUR 1,067 million
received from the sale of the combined Lumileds and
Automotive businesses.
In 2016, cash flows from investing activities includes
EUR 144 million cash inflow related to the Funai
arbitration and cash flows from financing activities
includes new funding of EUR 1.2 billion attracted by
Philips Lighting.
Assets classified as held for sale
As of December 31, 2017, assets held for sale consisted
of the retained interest in Philips Lighting for an amount
of EUR 1,264 million, property, plant and equipment for
an amount of EUR 40 million, and assets and liabilities
directly associated with assets held for sale businesses
of EUR 44 million.
Philips will sell down its retained interest in Philips
Lighting within one year. Therefore, the current position
of 29.01% is a temporary position which fits in our single
coordinated plan to sell Philips Lighting in its entirety.
Consequently any results related to the retained
interest - such as value adjustments, results upon
disposal and dividends - will be reflected in
discontinued operation.
The valuation basis for the retained interest in Philips
Lighting shares is the lower of the carrying value as per
November 28, 2017 (based on the closing share price of
EUR 32.975) or the value based on the stock price, less
cost to sell, at reporting date. Based on the share price
of Philips Lighting as of December 31, 2017 of EUR 30.60

126

Annual Report 2017

and taking into account expected cost to sell, we
recognized a loss in discontinued operations of EUR
104 million.

Acquisitions and divestments
2017
Philips completed ten acquisitions in 2017. The
acquisitions involved an aggregated net cash outflow
of EUR 2,333 million. These acquisitions had an
aggregated impact on Goodwill and Other intangible
assets of EUR 1,548 million and EUR 926 million
respectively.
The Spectranetics Corporation (Spectranetics) is the
most notable acquisition and is discussed below. The
remaining nine acquisitions involved an aggregated net
cash outflow of EUR 425 million. Separately, the net
cash outflow ranged from EUR 3 million to EUR 117
million. These remaining acquisitions had an
aggregated impact on Goodwill and Other intangible
assets of EUR 293 million and EUR 252 million
respectively.
On August 9, 2017 Philips completed the acquisition of
Spectranetics, by acquiring all of the issued and
outstanding shares of Spectranetics for USD 38.50 per
share, paid in cash at completion. As of the date of
acquisition, Spectranetics became a wholly owned
subsidiary of Philips and was consolidated within
Philips Image-Guided Therapy business as part of the
Diagnosis & Treatment businesses segment.
Spectranetics is a US-based global leader in vascular
intervention and lead management solutions, present
in 11 countries and employs over 900 employees.
The acquisition involved a net cash outflow of EUR
1,908 million. This amount comprised the purchase
price of shares (EUR 1,441 million), the settlement of
share-based compensation plans (EUR 94 million), the
redemption of debt (EUR 378 million) and the
settlement of various other items (EUR 48 million). The
overall cash position of Spectranetics on the
transaction date was EUR 53 million.
Acquisition-related costs of EUR 25 million were
recognized in General and administrative expenses.

The condensed opening balance sheet of
Spectranetics as of August 9, 2017 was as follows:

2038, discounted at a rate of 10.5%. The fair value of
Technology is based on the assumption that certain
savings in royalty payments can be achieved until 2032,
which are discounted at a rate ranging from 11.5% to
13.0%.

Opening balance positions are subject to final purchase
price adjustments, expected to be processed in the first
quarter of 2018. Main pending final purchase price
adjustments concern Goodwill, Other Intangible assets
(Customer relationships, Technology) and Deferred tax
liabilities.
Goodwill recognized in the amount of EUR 1,255
million, which at the date of this report is treated as
non-deductible for tax purposes, mainly represents the
impact of cost synergies. Cost synergies relate to
expected lower General and administrative expenses
and Selling expenses subsequent to the integration of
Spectranetics.
Receivables and other current assets include value
adjustments of EUR 3 million, representing the best
estimate at the acquisition date of the contractual cash
flows not expected to be received.
Other intangible assets were comprised of the

The main categories of Other intangible assets
(Customer relationships and Technology) are
determined using an ‘income approach’, which is a
valuation technique that estimates the fair value of an
asset based on market participants’ expectations of the
cash flows generated by that asset over its remaining
useful life.
The fair value of the Customer relationships relates to
an estimate of positive cash flows associated with
incremental profits related to excess earnings until

As from August 9, 2017, Spectranetics contributed sales
of EUR 114 million and generated a negative net income
of EUR 37 million.

Interests in entities
In this section we discuss the nature of the Company’s
interests in its consolidated entities and associates, and
the effects of those interests on the Company’s
financial position and financial performance.

Transactions in Philips Lighting shares
In the course of 2017, Philips completed three separate
transactions in Philips Lighting shares which reduced
the interest in this company from 71.23% as of
December 31, 2016 to 29.01% as of December 31, 2017.
In February and April 2017, the Company sold
48,250,000 shares through two accelerated bookbuild
offerings to institutional investors, which resulted in a
net cash inflow of EUR 1,060 million. These divestment
transactions did not impact the profit and loss account
of the Company because subsequent to these
transactions Philips Lighting continued to be fully
consolidated as it was controlled by Royal Philips. The
two offerings had a positive impact on Shareholders’
equity of the Company of EUR 327 million. This amount
includes (i) the difference between the proceeds and
the carrying value of the shares sold in these
transactions (increase of EUR 352 million), (ii) costs
related to the accelerated bookbuild offering which
were directly recognized in Shareholders’ equity
(decrease of EUR 6 million) and (iii) certain reallocations
of currency translation adjustments to Non-controlling
interests (decrease of EUR 19 million).
On November 28, 2017, the Company sold 17,100,000
shares through an accelerated bookbuild offering to
institutional investors. This transaction triggered a loss
of control by the Company, resulting in a
deconsolidation of Philips Lighting. Upon
deconsolidation of Philips Lighting, the Company
recognized a gain of EUR 599 million before tax, which
was recorded in Discontinued operations. For further
details regarding this result, reference is made to note 3,
Discontinued operations and assets classified as held
for sale.

Group companies
Set out below is a list of material subsidiaries as per
December 31, 2017 representing greater than 5% of
either the consolidated group Sales, Income from
operations or Net income (before any intra-group
eliminations) of Group legal entities. All of the entities
are fully consolidated in the group accounts of the
Company.

Involvement with unconsolidated structured
entities
Philips founded three Philips Medical Capital (PMC)
entities, in the United States, France and Germany, in
which Philips holds a minority interest. Philips Medical
Capital, LLC in the United States is the most significant
entity. PMC entities provide healthcare equipment
financing and leasing services to Philips customers for
diagnostic imaging equipment, patient monitoring
equipment, and clinical IT systems.
The Company concluded that it does not control, and
therefore should not consolidate the PMC entities. In
the United States, PMC operates as a subsidiary of De
Lage Landen Financial Services, Inc. The same structure
and treatment is applied to the PMC entities in the other
countries, with other majority shareholders. Operating
agreements are in place for all PMC entities, whereby
acceptance of sales and financing transactions resides
with the respective majority shareholder. After
acceptance of a transaction by PMC, Philips transfers
significant risk and rewards and does not retain any
obligations towards PMC or its customers, from the
sales contracts.
At December 31, 2017, Philips’ stake in Philips Medical
Capital, LLC amounted to EUR 29 million (December 31,
2016: EUR 25 million).

Net financial income and expense showed a EUR 137
million expense in 2017, which was EUR 305 million
lower than in 2016. Net interest expense in 2017 was
EUR 117 million lower than in 2016, mainly due to lower
interest expenses on net debt following the bond
redemptions in October 2016 and January 2017. Higher
dividend income was mainly related to the retained
interest in the combined businesses of Lumileds and
Automotive.

differences are expenses, which offset the corresponding tax benefits in
Origination and reversal of temporary differences, tax losses and tax
credits

Philips’ operations are subject to income taxes in
various foreign jurisdictions. The statutory income tax
rates varies up to 40.0%, which results in a difference
between the weighted average statutory income tax
rate and the Netherlands’ statutory income tax rate of
25.0% (2016: 25.0%; 2015: 25.0%).
A reconciliation of the weighted average statutory
income tax rate to the effective income tax rate of
continuing operations is as follows:

The effective income tax rate was higher than the
weighted average statutory income tax rate in 2017,
largely due to a tax charge recorded for the remeasurement of Philips’ US deferred tax assets as a
result of the enactment of the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
in December 2017. This effect was partly offset by tax
benefits from the recognition of deferred tax assets
which were previously unrecognized.

132

Annual Report 2017

Deferred tax assets are recognized for temporary
differences, unused tax losses, and unused tax credits
to the extent that realization of the related tax benefits
is probable. The ultimate realization of deferred tax
assets is dependent upon the generation of future
taxable income in the countries where the deferred tax
assets originated and during the periods when the
deferred tax assets become deductible. Management
considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax
liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax
planning strategies in making this assessment.
Net deferred tax assets relate to the following
underlying assets and liabilities and tax loss
carryforwards (including tax credit carryforwards) and
their movements during the years 2017 and 2016
respectively are presented in the tables below.
The net deferred tax assets of EUR 1,565 million (2016:
EUR 2,692 million) consist of deferred tax assets of EUR
1,598 million (2016: EUR 2,758 million) and deferred tax
liabilities of EUR 33 million (2016: EUR 66 million). The
decrease in the net deferred tax assets by EUR 1,127
million is predominantly attributable to the
deconsolidation of Philips Lighting (EUR 437 million)
the tax rate change in the US (EUR 200 million),
acquisitions (EUR 186 million) and the impact of foreign
currency translation (EUR 177 million).
The tax rate change as a result of the enactment of the
US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017 resulted in
EUR 200 million decrease of deferred tax assets, of
which EUR 171 million is recognized as a tax expense in
net income and EUR 29 million in equity. Of the total
expense, EUR 99 million is presented within net income
from Discontinued operations following the Company’s
policy to present and recognize re-measurements of
deferred taxes as a result of tax rate changes based on
the origin of the deferred tax (backwards tracing). As the
originating tax result was based on the Lumileds and
Lighting discontinued operations, the impact of the tax
rate change is also recognized in Discontinued
operations. The impact of the tax rate change relating
to discontinued operations and equity, acquisitions and
foreign currency translation are presented as ‘Other’ in
the table below.
Of the total deferred tax assets of EUR 1,598 million at
December 31, 2017 (2016: EUR 2,758 million), EUR 161
million (2016: EUR 2,054 million) is recognized in
respect of entities in various countries where there have
been tax losses in the current or preceding period.
Management’s projections support the assumption
that it is probable that the results of future operations
will generate sufficient taxable income to utilize these
deferred tax assets.

Group financial statements 11.9

At December 31, 2017 the temporary differences
associated with investments, including potential
income tax consequences on dividends, for which no
deferred tax liabilities are recognized, aggregate to EUR
290 million (2016: EUR 685 million).

At December 31, 2017, the amount of deductible
temporary differences for which no deferred tax asset
has been recognized in the balance sheet was EUR 42
million (2016: EUR 868 million)

The company has available tax loss and credit
carryforwards, which expire as follows:

Philips is exposed to tax risks. With regard to these tax
risks a liability is recognized if, as a result of a past event,
Philips has an obligation that can be estimated reliably
and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits
will be required to settle the obligation. These uncertain
positions are presented as Other tax liabilities in
note 22, Other liabilities and include, among others, the

US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
Philips assessed the impact of the material aspects of
the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on its current and deferred
tax assets and liabilities. These reported amounts may
be subject to estimation uncertainty and measurement
adjustments may need to be made in subsequent
reporting periods as Philips will get more accurate
information on the impact of the Act and the modalities
of its application. The main uncertainties relate to the
availability of net interest expense carryforwards and
the amount of tax earnings and profits subject to tax
under the mandatory deemed repatriation provisions.

Transfer pricing risks
Philips has issued transfer pricing directives, which are
in accordance with international guidelines such as
those of the Organization of Economic Co-operation
and Development. In order to reduce the transfer
pricing uncertainties, monitoring procedures are carried
out by Group Tax to safeguard the correct
implementation of the transfer pricing directives.

Tax risks on general and specific service
agreements and licensing agreements
Due to the centralization of certain activities (such as
research and development, IT and group functions),
costs are also centralized. As a consequence, these
costs and/or revenues must be allocated to the
beneficiaries, i.e. the various Philips entities. For that
purpose, service contracts such as intra-group service
agreements and licensing agreements are signed with
a large number of group entities. Tax authorities review
these intra-group service and licensing agreements,
and may reject the implemented intra-group charges.
Furthermore, buy in/out situations in the case of
(de)mergers could affect the cost allocation resulting
from the intragroup service agreements between
countries. The same applies to the specific service
agreements.

134

Annual Report 2017

Tax risks due to disentanglements and
acquisitions
When a subsidiary of Philips is disentangled, or a new
company is acquired, tax risks may arise. Philips creates
merger and acquisition (M&A) teams for these
disentanglements or acquisitions. In addition to
representatives from the involved business, these
teams consist of specialists from various group
functions and are formed, among other things, to
identify tax risks and to reduce potential tax claims
related to disentangled entities. Examples of tax risks
are: applicability of participation exemptions, cost
allocation issues, and issues related to
(non-)deductibility.

Tax risks due to permanent establishments
A permanent establishment may arise when operations
in a country involve a Philips organization in another
country, there is a risk that tax claims will arise in the
former country as well as in the latter country;
potentially leading to double taxation.

The expected useful lives of property, plant and
equipment are as follows:

In 2016, goodwill increased by EUR 140 million mainly
due to the acquisition of Wellcentive and PathXL. The
increase of EUR 248 million is mainly due to translation
differences which impacted the goodwill denominated
in USD.

For impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to (groups
of) cash-generating units (typically one level below
segment level), which represent the lowest level at
which the goodwill is monitored internally for
management purposes.
Goodwill allocated to the cash-generating units ImageGuided Therapy, Patient Care & Monitoring Solutions
and Sleep & Respiratory Care is considered to be
significant in comparison to the total book value of
goodwill for the Group at December 31, 2017. In 2016
the cash-generating unit Professional was considered
to be significant in comparison to the total book value
of goodwill for the Group, but this is no longer included
in goodwill as at December 31, 2017 due to the
divestment of Lighting. The amounts associated as of
December 31, 2017, are presented below:

In 2017, the movement of goodwill for the amount of
EUR 1,548 million relates to Spectranetics for an
amount of EUR 1,255 million and other acquisitions for
an amount of EUR 293 million. Information on the
divestment of Lighting can be found in note 3,
Discontinued operations and assets classified as held
for sale. The decrease of EUR 836 million is mainly due
to translation differences which impacted the goodwill
denominated in USD.

Key assumptions - general
Key assumptions used in the impairment tests for the
units were sales growth rates, EBITA and the rates used
for discounting the projected cash flows. These cash
flow projections were determined using the Royal
Philips managements’ internal forecasts that cover an
initial period from 2018 to 2020. Projections were
extrapolated with stable or declining growth rates for a
period of 5 years, after which a terminal value was
calculated. For terminal value calculation, growth rates
were capped at a historical long-term average growth
rate.
The sales growth rates and EBITA used to estimate cash
flows are based on past performance, external market
growth assumptions and industry long-term growth

averages. EBITA in all units mentioned in this note is
expected to increase over the projection period as a
result of volume growth and cost efficiencies.
Key assumptions and sensitivity analysis relating to
cash-generating units to which a significant amount
of goodwill is allocated
Cash flow projections of Image-Guided Therapy,

possible change in key assumptions would not cause
the value in use to fall to the level of the carrying value.

sensitive to fluctuations in the assumptions as set out
above.
Based on the most recent impairment test of the cashgenerating unit Home Monitoring, it was noted that an
increase of 90 points in the pre-tax discount rate, a 140
basis points decline in the compound long-term sales
growth rate or a 12% decrease in terminal value would,
individually, cause its recoverable amount to fall to the
level of its carrying value. The goodwill allocated to
Home Monitoring at December 31, 2017 amounts to EUR
32 million.
Based on the annual impairment test of the cashgenerating unit Population Health Management, it was
noted that an increase of 120 points in the pre-tax
discount rate, a 400 basis points decline in the
compound long-term sales growth rate or a 24%
decrease in terminal value would, individually, cause its
recoverable amount to fall to the level of its carrying
value. The goodwill allocated to Population Health
Management at December 31, 2017 amounts to EUR 187
million.
Also based on the annual impairment test of the cashgenerating unit Healthcare Informatics, it was noted
that an increase of 70 points in the pre-tax discount
rate, a 150 basis points decline in the compound longterm sales growth rate or a 11% decrease in terminal
value would, individually, cause its recoverable amount
to fall to the level of its carrying value. The goodwill
allocated to Healthcare Informatics at December 31,
2017 amounts to EUR 174 million.

Available-for-sale financial assets
The Company’s investments in available-for-sale
financial assets mainly consist of investments in
common shares of companies in various industries. In
2017, the main movements in available-for-sale
financial assets can be explained by transactions
following the divestment of the combined Lumileds
and Automotive businesses as further described in
note 3, Discontinued operations and assets classified as
held for sale.
The Company sold the majority stake in the combined
Lumileds and Automotive businesses on June 30, 2017.
The retained investment in Luminescence Coöperatief
U.A., a Dutch cooperative with excluded liability
(coöperatie met uitgesloten aansprakelijkheid),
consisting of a 19.1% membership interest and a
participating preferred interest received as part of the
sale, is classified under available-for-sale financial
assets. As of December 31, 2017, the investment was
valued at EUR 243 million, reflecting a value adjustment
of EUR 49 million in the second half of 2017.
Contractual obligations
The Company has entered into contracts with venture
capitalists where it committed itself to make, under
certain conditions, capital contributions to their
investment funds to an aggregated amount of EUR 83
million (2016: EUR 90 million) until June 30, 2021. As at
December 31, 2017 capital contributions already made
to these investment funds are recorded as availablefor-sale financial assets within Other non-current
financial assets.

14

Current financial assets
Current financial assets decreased by EUR 99 million
from EUR 101 million in 2016 to EUR 2 million in 2017.
This is mainly due to the repayment of EUR 90 million
of loans by TPV Technology limited.

shares, each share having a par value of EUR 0.20
(December 31, 2016: 929,644,864; December 31, 2015:
931,130,387).

Preference shares
As a means to protect the Company and its
stakeholders against an unsolicited attempt to obtain
(de facto) control of the Company, the General Meeting
of Shareholders in 1989 adopted amendments to the
Company’s articles of association that allow the Board
of Management and the Supervisory Board to issue
(rights to acquire) preference shares to a third party.
The ‘Stichting Preferente Aandelen Philips’ has been
granted the right to acquire preference shares in the
Company. Such right has not been exercised as of
December 31, 2017 and no preference shares have been
issued. Authorized preference shares consist of 2 billion
shares as of December 31, 2017 (December 31, 2016: 2
billion; December 31, 2015: 2 billion).

Options, restricted and performance shares
The Company has granted stock options on its common
shares and rights to receive common shares in the
future (see note 26, Share-based compensation).

Treasury shares

share-based compensation plans and capital
reduction), shares which have been repurchased and
are held in Treasury for the purpose of (i) delivery upon
exercise of options, restricted and performance share
programs, and (ii) capital reduction, are accounted for
as a reduction of shareholders’ equity. Treasury shares
are recorded at cost, representing the market price on
the acquisition date. When issued, shares are removed
from treasury shares on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis.
When treasury shares are reissued under the
Company’s option plans, the difference between the
cost and the cash received is recorded in retained
earnings. When treasury shares are reissued under the
Company’s share plans, the difference between the
market price of the shares issued and the cost is
recorded in retained earnings, the market price is
recorded in capital in excess of par value.
Dividend withholding tax in connection with the
Company’s purchase of treasury shares for capital
reduction purposes is recorded in retained earnings.
The following table shows the movements in the
outstanding number of shares over the last three years:

Share purchase transactions related to employee

to the reduction of share capital, involved a cash
outflow of EUR 642 million, which includes the impact
of taxes. A cash inflow of EUR 227 million from treasury
shares mainly includes settlements of share-based
compensation plans.

Share repurchase methods for the purposes
of share deliveries under share-based
compensation plans and capital reduction
During 2017, Royal Philips repurchased shares for
covering obligations resulting from past and present
share-based compensation programs via three
different share repurchase methods: (i) daily share buyback repurchases in the open market via an
intermediary (ii) repurchase of shares via forward
contracts for future delivery of shares (iii) the unwinding
of call options on own shares. In 2017, Royal Philips also
entered into forward contracts with several banks to
repurchase shares for capital reduction purposes. The
methods (ii) and (iii) are detailed below.

Forward share repurchase contracts
In order to hedge commitments under share-based
compensation plans, Philips entered into a forward
contract in the first quarter of 2017. This transaction
involved 3 million shares. This resulted in a reduction of
Retained earnings of EUR 81 million against Short-term
liabilities. In 2017, there were three exercises under the
forward share buy-back contract involving 2,250,000
shares, resulting in a EUR 61 million increase in Retained
earnings against Treasury shares. The remaining
750,000 shares, with a forward price of EUR 27.03, will
be repurchased in the first quarter of 2018.
In order to reduce its share capital, Royal Philips also
entered into six forward contracts. In 2017, EUR 998
million was deducted from Retained earnings and was
recorded against Short-term liabilities. The forward
contacts involved 31,020,000 shares with a settlement
date varying between October 2018 and June 2019 and
a weighted average forward price of EUR 32.22. For
further information on the forward contracts please
refer to note 18, Debt.

Share call options
During 2016 Philips bought EUR and USDdenominated call options to hedge options granted
under share-based compensation plans before 2013.
In 2017, the Company unwound 5,268,741 EURdenominated and 2,661,016 USD-denominated call
options against the transfer of the same number of
Royal Philips shares (7,929,757 shares) and an
additional EUR 160 million cash payment to the buyer
of the call options.
The number of outstanding EUR denominated options
were 3,287,125 and USD-denominated options were
2,974,344, as of December 2017.

Dividend distribution
2017
In June 2017, Philips settled a dividend of EUR 0.80 per
common share, representing a total value of EUR 742
million including costs. Shareholders could elect for a
cash dividend or a share dividend. Approximately 48%
of the shareholders elected for a share dividend,
resulting in the issuance of 11,264,163 new common
shares. The settlement of the cash dividend involved an
amount of EUR 384 million (including costs).
A proposal will be submitted to the 2018 Annual
General Meeting of Shareholders to pay a dividend of
EUR 0.80 per common share, in cash or shares at the
option of the shareholders, against the net income of
the Company for 2017.
2016
In June 2016, Philips settled a dividend of EUR 0.80 per
common share, representing a total value of EUR 732
million including costs. Shareholders could elect for a
cash dividend or a share dividend. Approximately 55%
of the shareholders elected for a share dividend,
resulting in the issuance of 17,344,462 new common
shares. The settlement of the cash dividend involved an
amount of EUR 330 million (including costs)
2015
In June 2015, Philips settled a dividend of EUR 0.80 per
common share, representing a total value of EUR 730
million including costs. Shareholders could elect for a

cash dividend or a share dividend. Approximately 59%
of the shareholders elected for a share dividend,
resulting in the issuance of 17,671,990 new common
shares. The settlement of the cash dividend involved an
amount of EUR 298 million (including costs).

Limitations in the distribution of
shareholders’ equity
As at December 31, 2017, pursuant to Dutch law, certain
limitations exist relating to the distribution of
shareholders’ equity of EUR 1,306 million. Such
limitations relate to common shares of EUR 188
million, as well as to legal reserves required by Dutch
law included under retained earnings of EUR 703
million, unrealized currency translation differences of
EUR 393 million and unrealized gains related to cash
flow hedges of EUR 23 million. The unrealized losses
related to available-for-sale financial assets of EUR 30
million, qualify as a legal reserve and reduce the
distributable amount due to the fact that this reserve is
negative.
The legal reserve required by Dutch law of EUR 703
million included under retained earnings relates to any
legal or economic restrictions on the ability of affiliated
companies to transfer funds to the parent company in
the form of dividends.
As at December 31, 2016, these limitations in
distributable amounts were EUR 2,181 million and
related to common shares of EUR 186 million, as well as
to legal reserves required by Dutch law included under
retained earnings of EUR 715 million, unrealized

currency translation differences of EUR 1,234 million,
available-for-sale financial assets of EUR 36 million
and unrealized gains related to cash flow hedges of
EUR 10 million.

Non-controlling interests
Non-controlling interests relate to minority stakes held
by third parties in consolidated group companies. In the
course of 2017 non-controlling interests reduced
significantly due to the deconsolidation of Philips
Lighting. For further details reference is made to note 5,
Interests in entities.

Capital management
Philips manages capital based upon the IFRS
measures, net cash provided by operating activities and
net cash used for investing activities as well as the nonIFRS measure net debt. The definition of this non-IFRS
measure and a reconciliation to the IFRS measure is

Net debt is defined as the sum of long and short-term
debt minus cash and cash equivalents. Group equity as
defined as the sum of shareholders’ equity and noncontrolling interests. This measure is used by Philips
Treasury management and investment analysts to
evaluate financial strength and funding requirements.
The Philips net debt position is managed with the
intention of retaining a strong investment grade credit
rating. Furthermore, Philips’ aim when managing the
net debt position is dividend stability and a pay-out
ratio of 40% to 50% of continuing net income after
adjustments.

Royal Philips has a USD 2.5 billion Commercial Paper
Programme and a EUR 1 billion committed revolving
credit facility that can be used for general group
purposes, such as a backstop of its Commercial Paper
Programme. As of December 31, 2017, Royal Philips did
not have any loans outstanding under either facility.
The EUR 1 billion committed revolving credit facility was
signed effective April 21, 2017, replacing the former EUR
1.8 billion facility of the Company. The new facility has
a tenor of five years and contains two 1-year extension

options. In line with the previous facility, it does not
have a material adverse change clause, has no financial
covenants and no credit-rating-related acceleration
possibilities.
The provisions applicable to all corporate USD
denominated bonds issued by the Company in March
2008 and March 2012 (due 2022, 2038 and 2042)
contain a ‘Change of Control Triggering Event’. If the
Company would experience such an event with respect
to a series of corporate bonds the Company might be

Group financial statements 11.9

required to offer to purchase the bonds that are still
outstanding at a purchase price equal to 101% of their
principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if
any.
Furthermore, the conditions applicable to the EUR
denominated corporate bonds issued in 2017 (due 2019
and 2023) contain a similar provision (‘Change of
Control Put Event’). Upon the occurrence of such an
event, the Company might be required to redeem or
purchase any of such bonds at their principal amount
together with interest accrued.
In January 2017, Philips entered into a USD 1,000
million and EUR 300 million credit facility with a
consortium of international banks. Under this credit
facility Philips drew USD 1,000 million in January 2017;
the facility was used for the early redemption of the
5.750% bonds due 2018 in the aggregate principal
amount of USD 1,250 million. In Q2 2017, the drawn
amount was repaid in full and the facility was cancelled.

In August 2017, Philips entered into a EUR 1,000 million
loan for the purpose of financing The Spectranetics
Corporation acquisition and for general purposes. In
September 2017, Philips successfully issued EUR 500
million floating-rate bonds due 2019 and EUR 500
million fixed-rate bonds due 2023. The net proceeds of
the offering were used for the repayment of the EUR
1,000 million loan entered into August 2017.
On June 28, 2017, Royal Philips announced a EUR 1.5
billion share buyback program. Philips started the
program in the third quarter of 2017, and intends to
complete it in two years. As the program was initiated
for capital reduction purposes, Philips intends to cancel
all of the shares acquired under the program. Under this
program, Royal Philips has entered into a number of
forward transactions with a number of financial
institutions, to be settled at future dates over the course
of the program. Over the second half of 2017, the
nominal amount was equal to EUR 998 million. These
forward contracts are accounted for as debt.

In May 2017, EUR 1,341 million of mainly long-term
Lighting debt was transferred to liabilities directly
associated with assets held for sale.

Environmental provisions
The environmental provisions include accrued costs
recorded with respect to environmental remediation in
various countries. In the United States, subsidiaries of
the Company have been named as potentially
responsible parties in state and federal proceedings for
the clean-up of certain sites.
Provisions for environmental remediation can change
significantly due to the emergence of additional
information regarding the extent or nature of the
contamination, the need to utilize alternative
technologies, actions by regulatory authorities as well
as changes in judgments and discount rates.
Approximately EUR 55 million is expected to be utilized
within the next five years, with the remainder being long
term. For more details on the environmental
remediation reference is made to note 24, Contingent
assets and liabilities.

Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) antitrust litigation
In 2015, 2016 and 2017, the majority of the movements
in relation to the CRT antitrust litigation were
utilizations due to the transfer to other liabilities for
which the Company was able to reach a settlement.
These settlements were subsequently paid out in the
respective following year.

The utilizations and reclassifications in 2016 mainly
related to Masimo. Reclassifications include
reclassification from litigation provisions to other

Masimo Corporation (Masimo) patent litigation

Additions

On October 1, 2014, a jury awarded USD 467 million to
Masimo Corporation (Masimo) in a trial held before the
United States District Court for the District of Delaware.
The decision by the jury completed an initial phase of
a three-phase trial regarding a first lawsuit started by
Masimo against the Company in 2009. A second
lawsuit was started by Masimo against the Company in
2016. Between the two lawsuits, claims were raised by
the parties against each other relating to patent
infringement and antitrust violations in the field of pulse
oximetry.
On November 5, 2016, the Company and Masimo
entered into a wide-ranging, multi-year business
partnership involving both companies’ innovations in
patient monitoring and therapy solutions, ending all
pending lawsuits between the two companies,
including releasing the Company from paying the USD
467 million jury verdict.
The Company and Masimo also agreed to:
• a USD 300 million cash payment by Philips to
Masimo;

148

• a one-time donation to the Masimo Foundation of
USD 5 million to support the Masimo Foundation’s
project on patient safety and better outcomes;
• commitments of the Company with respect to sales
targets, marketing and product integration over the
coming years of about USD 136 million.

The main elements of other provisions are:
• provisions for possible taxes/social security of EUR
97 million (2016: EUR 131 million);
• onerous contract provisions for unfavorable supply
contracts as part of divestment transactions, onerous
(sub)lease contracts and expected losses on existing
projects /orders totaling EUR 31 million (2016: EUR 85
million);
• provisions for employee jubilee funds EUR 57 million
(2016: EUR 84 million);
• self-insurance provisions of EUR 48 million (2016:
EUR 77 million);
• provisions for decommissioning costs of EUR 32
million (2016: EUR 48 million);

• provisions for rights of return of EUR 37 million (2016:

• provisions for other employee benefits and
obligatory severance payments of EUR 24 million
(2016: EUR 38 million);
• provisions for contingent considerations of EUR 66
million (2016: EUR 11 million);
• the release in 2017 of EUR 88 million is due to the
reassessment of our positions in other provisions.

Company’s qualified pension commitments in the
United States are partly protected via the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) which charges a
fee to US companies providing DB pension plans. The
fee is also dependent on the amount of unfunded
liabilities.

Other provisions are expected to be utilized mainly
within the next five years, except for:

Germany

• provisions for employee jubilee funds of which a
quarter is expected to be utilized within the next five
years;
• provisions for contingent considerations of which
nearly half is expected to be utilized after five years;
• provisions for decommissioning costs of which over
half is expected to be utilized after five years;
• provisions for rights of return to be utilized mainly
within the next year.

Post-employment benefits
Employee post-employment plans have been
established in many countries in accordance with the
legal requirements, customs and the local practice in
the countries involved. All funded post-employment
plans are considered to be related parties.
Most employees that take part in a Company pension
plan are covered by defined-contribution (DC) pension
plans. The main DC plans are in the Netherlands and
the United States. The Company also sponsors a
number of defined-benefit (DB) pension plans. The
benefits provided by these plans are based on
employees’ years of service and compensation levels.
The Company also sponsors a limited number of DB
retiree medical plans. The benefits provided by these
plans typically cover a part of the healthcare costs after
retirement. The larger funded DB and DC plans are
governed by independent Trustees who have a legal
obligation to protect the interests of all plan members
and operate under the local regulatory framework.

In 2017, the Company performed an additional derisking contribution into the US plan of EUR 219 million.

The Company has several DB plans in Germany which
for the largest part are unfunded, meaning that after
retirement the Company is responsible for the benefit
payments to retirees.
Due to the relatively high level of social security in
Germany, the Company’s pension plans mainly provide
benefits for the higher earners and are open for future
pension accrual. Indexation is mandatory due to legal
requirements. Some of the German plans have a DC
design, but are accounted for as DB plans due to a legal
minimum return requirement.
Company pension commitments in Germany are partly
protected against employer bankruptcy via the
“Pensions Sicherungs Verein” which charges a fee to all
German companies providing pension promises.
Philips is one of the sponsors of Philips Pensionskasse
VVaG in Germany, which is a multi-employer plan. The
plan is accounted for as a DC plan.

Settlement of the Brazil pension plans in
2017
The DB and DC pension plans in Brazil that were
operated by the multi-employer plan in Brazil, Philips
Seguridade Social, have been fully terminated in 2017.
All Philips’ employees in Brazil have been transferred
to an insured DC pension plan for future service.

The largest DB plans in 2017 are in the United States and
Germany. These plans account for approximately 89%
of the total DBO.

Since all risks for the Company with respect to the DB
pension plan have been eliminated, the Company
recognized a settlement in 2017. The decrease of the
DBO due to the settlement amounts to EUR 345
million. At the moment of the settlement the plan had
a surplus. As the surplus was not recognized in the
balance sheet due to the asset ceiling test, the
Company only recognized the additional payments of
EUR 1 million as settlement loss, as per the Company’s
accounting policy.

The United States

Risks related to DB plans

The US DB pension plans are closed plans without
future pension accrual. For the funding of any deficit in
the US plan the Group adheres to the minimum funding
requirements of the US Pension Protection Act.

DB plans expose the Company to various demographic
and economic risks such as longevity risk, investment
risks, currency and interest rate risk and in some cases
inflation risk. The latter plays a role in the assumed
wage increase but more importantly in some countries
where indexation of pensions is mandatory. Pension
fund Trustees are responsible for and have full
discretion over the investment strategy of the plan

The average duration of the defined-benefit obligation
(DBO) of the DB plans is 12 years (2016: 11 years).

The assets of the US funded pension plans are in Trusts
governed by Trustees. The excess pension plans that
covered accrual above the maximum salary of the
funded plan are unfunded.

assets. In general Trustees manage pension fund risks
by diversifying the investments of plan assets and by
(partially) matching interest rate risk of liabilities.
The Company has an active de-risking strategy in which
it constantly looks for opportunities to reduce the risks
associated with its DB plans. Liability-driven
investment strategies, lump sum cash-out options,
buy-ins, buy-outs and a change to DC are examples of
the strategy.

The trustees of the Philips pension plans are
responsible for and have full discretion over the
investment strategy of the plan assets.
The plan assets of the Philips pension plans are
invested in well diversified portfolios. The interest rate
sensitivity of the fixed income portfolio is closely
aligned to that of the plan’s pension liabilities. Any
contributions from the sponsoring company are used to
further increase the fixed income part of the assets. As
part of the investment strategy, any additional
investment returns of the return portfolio are used to
further decrease the interest rate mismatch between
the plan assets and the pension liabilities.

The tables below illustrates the approximate impact on
the DBO from movements in key assumptions. The DBO
was recalculated using a change in the assumptions of
1% which overall is considered a reasonably possible
change. The impact on the DBO because of changes in
discount rate is normally accompanied by offsetting
movements in plan assets, especially when using
matching strategies.

The assets in 2017 contain 37 % (2016: 58 %) unquoted
assets. Plan assets in 2017 do not include property
occupied by or financial instruments issued by the
Company.

The mortality table (i.e. longevity) also impacts the
DBO. The above sensitivity table illustrates the impact
on the DBO of a further 10% decrease in the assumed
rates of mortality for the Company’s major schemes. A
10% decrease in assumed mortality rates equals
improvement of life expectancy by 0.5 - 1 year.

Cash flows and costs in 2018
The Company expects considerable cash outflows in
relation to post-employment benefits which are
estimated to amount to EUR 399 million in 2018,
consisting of:
• EUR 30 million employer contributions to funded DB
plans (US: EUR 0 million, DE: EUR 23 million, Other:
EUR 7 million);
• EUR 40 million cash outflows in relation to unfunded
DB plans (US: EUR 9 million, DE: EUR 19 million,
Other: EUR 12 million); and
• EUR 329 million employer contributions to DC plans
(NL: EUR 166 million, US: EUR 109 million, Other: EUR
54 million).
The service and administration cost for 2018 is
expected to amount to EUR 28 million for DB plans. The
net interest cost for 2018 for the DB plans is expected
to amount to EUR 25 million. The cost for DC pension
plans in 2018 is equal to the expected DC cash flow.

Contingent assets and liabilities
Contingent assets
As per December 31, 2017, the Company had no
material contingent assets.

Contingent liabilities
Guarantees
Philips’ policy is to provide guarantees and other letters
of support only in writing. Philips does not stand by
other forms of support. The total fair value of
guarantees recognized on the balance sheet amounts
to EUR nilmillion for both 2016 and 2017. Remaining offbalance-sheet business and credit-related guarantees

provided on behalf of third parties and associates
decreased by EUR 11 million during 2017 to EUR 17
million (December 31, 2016: EUR 28 million).
Environmental remediation
The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to
environmental laws and regulations. Under these laws,
the Company and/or its subsidiaries may be required
to remediate the effects of certain manufacturing
activities on the environment.
Legal proceedings
The Company and certain of its group companies and
former group companies are involved as a party in legal
proceedings, regulatory and other governmental
proceedings, including discussions on potential

Annual Report 2017

153

Group financial statements 11.9

remedial actions, relating to such matters as
competition issues, commercial transactions, product
liability, participations and environmental pollution.
While it is not feasible to predict or determine the
ultimate outcome of all pending or threatened legal
proceedings, regulatory and governmental
proceedings, the Company is of the opinion that the
cases described below may have, or have had in the
recent past, a significant impact on the Company’s
consolidated financial position, results of operations
and cash flows.
Cathode Ray Tubes (CRT)
Starting in 2007, competition law authorities in several
jurisdictions had commenced investigations into
possible anticompetitive activities in the Cathode Ray
Tubes, or CRT industry. On December 5, 2012, this lead
to a European Commission decision imposing fines on
(former) CRT manufacturers including the Company.
The European Commission imposed a fine of EUR 313
million on the Company and a fine of EUR 392 million
jointly and severally on the Company and LG
Electronics, Inc. In total a payable of EUR 509 million
was recognized in 2012 and the fine was paid in the first
quarter of 2013. The Company appealed the decision of
the European Commission with the General Court and
later with European Court of Justice. These appeals
were denied on September 9, 2015 and September 15,
2017 respectively. No further appeals are pending.
United States
Subsequent to the public announcement of these
investigations in 2007, certain Philips Group companies
were named as defendants in class action antitrust
complaints by direct and indirect purchasers of CRTs
filed in various federal district courts in the United
States. These actions alleged anticompetitive conduct
by manufacturers of CRTs and sought treble damages
on a joint and several liability basis. In addition, sixteen
individual plaintiffs, principally large retailers of CRT
products who opted out of the direct purchaser class,
filed separate complaints against the Company and
other defendants based on the same substantive
allegations. All these actions were consolidated for pretrial proceedings in the United States District Court for
the Northern District of California. In addition, the state
attorneys general of California, Florida, Illinois, Oregon
and Washington filed actions against the Company and
other defendants seeking to recover damages on
behalf of the states and, acting as parens patriae, their
consumers.
With the exception of the action brought by the state
attorney of Washington, which remains pending, all
other actions have been settled or otherwise resolved.
The indirect purchaser settlement was approved by the
United States District Court for the Northern District of
California in 2016 and is now pending before the Ninth
Circuit Court of Appeals.

Annual Report 2017

Canada
In 2007, certain Philips Group companies were also
being named as defendants in proposed class
proceedings in Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia,
Canada, along with numerous other participants in the
industry. After years of inactivity, in 2014, plaintiffs in the
Ontario action initiated the class certification
proceedings leading to class certification in the second
half of 2016. In 2017, a settlement in principle has been
reached for all three proposed class actions.
Other jurisdictions
In 2014, the Company was named as a defendant in a
consumer class action lawsuit filed in Israel in which
damages are claimed against several defendants based
on alleged anticompetitive activities in the CRT
industry. In addition, an electronics manufacturer filed
a claim against the Company and several codefendants with a court in the Netherlands and Turkey,
also seeking compensation for the alleged damage
sustained as a result from the alleged anticompetitive
activities in the CRT industry. In 2015 and 2016, the
Company became involved in further civil CRT antitrust
litigation with previous CRT customers in the United
Kingdom, Germany, Brazil and Denmark. In all cases,
the same substantive allegations about anticompetitive
activities in the CRT industry are made and damages are
sought. The Company has received indications that
more civil claims may be filed in due course.
Except for what has been provided or accrued for as
disclosed in note 19, Provisions and note 22, Other
liabilities, the Company has concluded that due to the
considerable uncertainty associated with certain of
these matters, based on current knowledge, potential
losses cannot be reliably estimated with respect to
these matters.
Personal Health
In December 2013, the European Commission
commenced an investigation into alleged restrictions of
online sales of consumer electronics products and
small domestic appliances. The Company was one of
several companies involved in the investigation. In
February 2017, the European Commission completed
its preliminary investigation and opened its formal
proceedings. Philips is fully cooperating with the
European Commission. Due to the considerable
uncertainty associated with this matter, on the basis of
current knowledge, the Company has concluded that
potential losses cannot be reliably estimated with
respect to these matters.
In April 2017, the Company received a Civil Investigative
Demand (CID) out of the US Attorney’s Office in
Northern District of Iowa. The CID relates to an
evaluation of the appropriateness of certain sleep and
respiratory care equipment financing programs
available for Respironics’ products. In addition, in late
2017, the Company received an information request
from the Department of Justice regarding the
relationship between Respironics’ business and certain

25 26

sleep centers that use Respironics’ products. The
Company has not been advised that any claim has been
asserted by the US government in connection with
these matters and it continues to cooperate fully in both
inquiries.

In addition to the table above, as part of its operations
in the US, Philips sold non-recourse third-party
receivables to PMC US amounting to EUR 151 million in
2017 (2016: EUR 139 million; 2015: EUR 129 million).
In light of the composition of the Executive Committee,
the Company considers the members of the Executive
Committee and the Supervisory Board to be the key
management personnel as defined in IAS 24 ‘Related
parties’.

Miscellaneous
As part of the divestment of the Television and Audio,
Video, Multimedia & Accessories businesses in 2012
and 2014, the Company transferred economic
ownership and control in some legal entities or divisions
thereof, while retaining (partial) legal ownership.
Considering the current challenging business
environment, the Company might face employee and
operational liabilities in case of certain adverse events.
Given the uncertain nature of the relevant events and
liabilities, it is not practicable to provide information on
the estimate of the financial effect, if any, or timing. The
outcome of the uncertain events could have a material
impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
position, results of operations and cash flows.
25

Related-party transactions
In the normal course of business, Philips purchases and
sells goods and services from/to various related parties
in which Philips typically holds between 20% and 50%
equity interest and has significant influence. These
transactions are generally conducted with terms
comparable to transactions with third parties.
From November 28, 2017, Philips lost control over
Philips Lighting but still has significant influence. This
has resulted in Philips Lighting becoming a nonconsolidated related party which is reported in the
table below for the time period November 28 to
December 31, 2017. Philips and Philips Lighting have
several agreements in place which impact the related
party balances disclosed. There is a Transitional Service
Level Agreement, based on which Philips provides
Philips Lighting with services such as IT, real estate and
human resources among others. Additionally, a
Trademark License Agreement was signed in which
Philips Lighting uses the Philips brand name.
For details of these parties in which Philips typically
holds between 20% and 50% equity interest, refer to
the Investments in associates section of note 5,
Interests in entities. For details on the Philips ownership
changes in Lighting, refer to note 3, Discontinued
operations and assets classified as held for sale.

Share-based compensation
The purpose of the share-based compensation plans is
to align the interests of management with those of
shareholders by providing incentives to improve the
Company’s performance on a long-term basis, thereby
increasing shareholder value.
The Company has the following plans:
• performance shares: rights to receive common shares
in the future based on performance and service
conditions;
• restricted shares: rights to receive common shares in
the future based on a service condition; and
• options on its common shares, including the 2012 and
2013 Accelerate! grant.
Since 2013 the Board of Management and other
members of the Executive Committee are only granted
performance shares. Restricted shares are granted to
executives, certain selected employees and new
employees. Prior to 2013 options were also granted.
Under the terms of employee stock purchase plans
established by the Company in various countries,
employees are eligible to purchase a limited number of
Philips shares at discounted prices through payroll
withholdings.
Share-based compensation costs from continuing
operations were EUR 122 million (2016: EUR 95 million;
2015: EUR 82 million). This includes the employee stock
purchase plan of EUR 7 million, which is not a sharebased compensation that affects equity. The sharebased compensation costs for staff belonging to Philips
Lighting and the combined businesses of Lumileds and
Automotive of EUR 42 million are included in
Discontinued operations. In the Consolidated
statements of changes in equity EUR 151 million is
recognized in 2017 and represent the costs of the sharebased compensation plans. The amount recognized as
an expense is adjusted for forfeiture. USD-

and options are granted to employees in the United

A summary of the status of the Company’s performance
share plans as of December 31, 2017 and changes
during the year are presented below:

Performance shares

Philips Group
Performance shares
2017

The performance is measured over a three-year
performance period. The performance shares have two
performance conditions, relative Total Shareholders’
Return compared to a peer group of 20 companies
(2016: 20 companies, 2015: 21 companies) and adjusted
Earnings Per Share growth. The performance shares
vest three years after the grant date. The number of
performance shares that will vest is dependent on
achieving the two performance conditions, which are
equally weighted, and provided that the grantee is still
employed with the Company.

The amount recognized as an expense is adjusted for
actual performance of adjusted Earnings Per Share
growth since this is a non-market performance
condition. It is not adjusted for non-vesting or extra
vesting of performance shares due to a relative Total
Shareholders’ Return performance that differs from the
performance anticipated at the grant date, since this is
a market-based performance condition.

Management’s expectation of future developments for
other purposes. The Company has based its volatility
assumptions on historical experience measured over a
ten-year period.

At December 31, 2017, a total of EUR 103 million of
unrecognized compensation costs relate to non-vested
performance shares. These costs are expected to be
recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.7
years.

Restricted shares
The fair value of restricted shares is equal to the share
price at grant date.
The Company issues restricted shares that, in general,
have a 3 year cliff-vesting period. For grants up to and
including January 2013 the Company granted 20%
additional (premium) shares, provided the grantee still
holds the shares after three years from the delivery date
and the grantee is still with the Company on the
respective delivery dates. As of December 31, 2017 all
restricted share plans granted before 2013 have vested
except their premium shares.

The annual incentives are related to the performance in the year reported which are paid out in the subsequent year
Costs of performance shares, stock options and restricted share rights are based on accounting standards (IFRS) and do not reflect the value of stock options at
the end of the lock up period and the value of performance shares and restricted share rights at the vesting/release date
Pension allowances are gross taxable allowances paid to the Executive Committee members in the Netherlands. These allowances are part of the pension
arrangement
The stated amounts mainly concern (share of) allowances to members of the Executive Committee that can be considered as remuneration. In a situation where
such a share of an allowance can be considered as (indirect) remuneration (for example, private use of the company car), then the share is both valued and
accounted for here. The method employed by the fiscal authorities is the starting point for the value stated.

Fair value of financial assets and liabilities
The estimated fair value of financial instruments has
been determined by the Company using available
market information and appropriate valuation
methods. The estimates presented are not necessarily
indicative of the amounts that will ultimately be
realized by the Company upon maturity or disposal.
The use of different market assumptions and/or
estimation methods may have a material effect on the
estimated fair value amounts.
For cash and cash equivalents, current receivables,
accounts payable, interest accrual and short-term
debts, the carrying amounts approximate fair value
because of the short maturity of these instruments, and
therefore fair value information is not included in the
table below.

Group financial statements 11.9

The fair value of Philips’ debt is estimated on the basis
of the quoted market prices for certain issues, or on the
basis of discounted cash flow analysis based upon
market rates plus Philips’ spread for the particular
tenors of the borrowing arrangement. Accrued interest
is not included within the carrying amount or estimated
fair value of debt.

The following table shows the carrying amounts and
fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities,
including their levels in the fair value hierarchy. It does
not include fair value information for financial assets
and financial liabilities not measured at fair value if the
carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of fair
value.

The table above represents categorization of
measurement of the estimated fair values of financial
assets and liabilities.
Specific valuation techniques used to value financial
instruments include:
Level 1
Instruments included in level 1 are comprised primarily
of listed equity investments classified as available-forsale financial assets, investees and financial assets
designated at fair value through profit and loss,
including the investment in Philips Lighting which is
held for sale as of December 31, 2017.
The fair value of financial instruments traded in active
markets is based on quoted market prices at the
balance sheet date. A market is regarded as active if
quoted prices are readily and regularly available from
an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing
service, or regulatory agency, and those prices
represent actual and regularly occurring market
transactions on an arm’s length basis.

164

(5,474)

(511)

Annual Report 2017

Level 2
The fair value of financial instruments that are not
traded in an active market (for example, over-thecounter derivatives or convertible bond instruments)
are determined by using valuation techniques. These
valuation techniques maximize the use of observable
market data where it is available and rely as little as
possible on entity-specific estimates. If all significant
inputs required to fair value an instrument are based on
observable market data, the instrument is included in
level 2.
The fair value of derivatives is calculated as the present
value of the estimated future cash flows based on
observable interest yield curves, basis spread and
foreign exchange rates.
The valuation of convertible bond instruments uses
observable market quoted data for the options and
present value calculations using observable yield
curves for the fair value of the bonds.

29

Level 3
If one or more of the significant inputs are not based on
observable market data, such as third-party pricing
information without adjustments, the instrument is
included in level 3.

master netting and set-off agreements. In the case of
certain termination events, under the terms of the
Master Agreement, Philips can terminate the
outstanding transactions and aggregate their positive
and negative values to arrive at a single net termination
sum (or close-out amount). This contractual right is
subject to the following:

If the valuation multiples were to increase
instantaneously by 10% from the assumption at
December 31, 2017, with all other variables (including
foreign exchange rates) held constant, the fair value of
the asset would increase by 18% while if there was a
decrease of 10% in valuation multiples, this would
reduce the market value of the asset by approximately
17%.

2018 shows that if the earnings were to increase
instantaneously by 10% from the assumption at
December 31, 2017, with all other variables (including
foreign exchange rates) held constant, the fair value of
the asset would increase by 28%. If there was a
decrease of 10% in earnings, this would reduce the
market value of the asset by approximately 26%.

Details of treasury / other financial risks
Philips is exposed to several types of financial risks. This
note further analyzes financial risks. Philips does not
purchase or hold derivative financial instruments for
speculative purposes. Information regarding financial
instruments is included in note 28, Fair value of financial
assets and liabilities.

Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that an entity will encounter
difficulty in meeting obligations associated with
financial liabilities.
Liquidity risk for the group is monitored through the
Treasury liquidity committee, which tracks the
development of the actual cash flow position for the
group and uses input from a number of sources in order
to forecast the overall liquidity position on both a short
and long-term basis. Group Treasury invests surplus
cash in money market deposits with appropriate
maturities to ensure sufficient liquidity is available to
meet liabilities when due.
The rating of the Company’s debt by major rating
services may improve or deteriorate. As a result, Philips’
future borrowing capacity may be influenced and its
financing costs may fluctuate. Philips has various

Annual Report 2017

165

Group financial statements 11.9

sources to mitigate the liquidity risk for the group. At
December 31, 2017, Philips had EUR 1,939 million in
cash and cash equivalents (2016: EUR 2,334 million),
within which short-term deposits of EUR 1,302 million
(2016: EUR 1,299 million). Philips pools cash from
subsidiaries to the extent legally and economically
feasible; cash not pooled remains available for the
Company’s operational or investment needs.

Philips faces cross-border foreign exchange controls
and/or other legal restrictions in a few countries that
could limit its ability to make these balances available
on short notice for general use by the group.
Furthermore, Royal Philips has a USD 2.5 billion
Commercial Paper Programme and a EUR 1 billion
committed revolving credit facility that can be used for
general group purposes, such as a backstop for its
Commercial Paper Programme. As of December 31,
2017, Royal Philips did not have any amounts
outstanding under any of these facilities. A description
of Philips’ credit facilities can be found in note 18, Debt.

The table below presents a summary of the Group’s
fixed contractual cash obligations and commitments at
December 31, 2017. These amounts are an estimate of
future payments which could change as a result of
various factors such as a change in interest rates,
contractual provisions, as well as changes in our
business strategy and needs. Therefore, the actual
payments made in future periods may vary from those

Purchase obligations are agreements to purchase goods or services that

significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased,
fixed, minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing
of the transaction. They do not include open purchase orders or other
commitments which do not specify all significant terms.

Certain Philips suppliers factor their trade receivables
from Philips with third parties through supplier finance
arrangements. At December 31, 2017 approximately
EUR 286 million of the Philips accounts payable were
known to have been sold onward under such
arrangements whereby Philips confirms invoices.
Philips continues to recognize these liabilities as trade
payables and will settle the liabilities in line with the
original payment terms of the related invoices.

Currency risk
Currency risk is the risk that reported financial
performance or the fair value or future cash flows of a
financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes
in foreign exchange rates. Philips operates in many
countries and currencies and therefore currency
fluctuations may impact Philips’ financial results.
Philips is exposed to currency risk in the following
areas:
• Transaction exposures, related to anticipated sales
and purchases and on-balance-sheet receivables/
payables resulting from such transactions
• Translation exposure of foreign-currency
intercompany and external debt and deposits
• Translation exposure of net income in foreign entities
• Translation exposure of foreign-currencydenominated equity invested in consolidated
companies
• Translation exposure to equity interests in nonfunctional-currency investments in associates and
available-for-sale financial assets.

166

Annual Report 2017

Group financial statements 11.9

It is Philips’ policy to reduce the potential year-on-year
volatility caused by foreign-currency movements on its
net earnings by hedging the anticipated net exposure
of foreign currencies resulting from foreign-currency
sales and purchases. In general, net anticipated
exposures for the Group are hedged during a period of
15 months in layers of 20% up to a maximum hedge of
80%, using forwards and currency options. Philips’
policy requires significant committed foreign currency
exposures to be fully hedged, generally using forwards.
However, not every foreign currency can or shall be
hedged as there may be regulatory barriers or
prohibitive hedging cost preventing Philips from
effectively and/or efficiently hedging its currency
exposures. As a result, hedging activities cannot and
will not eliminate all currency risks for anticipated and
committed transaction exposures.
The following table outlines the estimated nominal
value in millions of EUR for committed and anticipated
transaction exposure and related hedges for Philips’
most significant currency exposures consolidated as of

The total net fair value of hedges related to transaction
exposure as of December 31, 2017, was an unrealized
asset of EUR 21 million. An instantaneous 10% increase
in the value of the EUR against all currencies would lead
to an increase of EUR 102 million in the value of the
derivatives; including a EUR 53 million increase related
to foreign exchange transactions of the USD against the
EUR, a EUR 17 million increase related to foreign
exchange transactions of the JPY against the EUR, a
EUR 10 million increase related to foreign exchange
transactions of the GBP against the EUR, a EUR 6
million increase related to foreign exchange
transactions of the PLN against the EUR and a EUR 5
million increase related to foreign exchange
transactions of the CHF against the EUR.

flow hedges. The results from such hedges are deferred
in other comprehensive income within equity to the
extent that the hedge is effective. As of December 31,
2017, a gain of EUR 23 million was deferred in equity as
a result of these hedges (2016: EUR 10 million gain). The
result deferred in equity will be released to earnings
mostly during 2018 at the time when the related hedged
transactions affect the income statement. During 2017,
a net gain of EUR 0.1 million (2016: EUR 5 million net
gain) was recorded in the consolidated statement of
income as a result of ineffectiveness on certain
anticipated cash flow hedges.

The change in exposures and related hedges compared
to 2016 is mainly driven by the deconsolidation of
Philips Lighting. Philips uses foreign exchange spot and
forward contracts, as well as zero cost collars in hedging
the exposure. The derivatives related to transactions
are, for hedge accounting purposes, split into hedges of
on-balance-sheet accounts receivable/payable and
forecasted sales and purchases. Changes in the value
of on-balance-sheet foreign-currency accounts
receivable/payable, as well as the changes in the fair
value of the hedges related to these exposures, are
reported in the income statement under costs of sales.
Hedges related to forecasted transactions, where
hedge accounting is applied, are accounted for as cash

The EUR 102 million increase includes a gain of EUR 10
million that would impact the income statement, which
would largely offset the opposite revaluation effect on
the underlying accounts receivable and payable, and
the remaining gain of EUR 92 million would be
recognized in equity to the extent that the cash flow
hedges were effective.

exposure as of December 31, 2016, was an unrealized
asset of EUR 15 million. An instantaneous 10% increase
in the value of the EUR against all currencies would lead
to an increase of EUR 98 million in the value of the
derivatives; including a EUR 46 million increase related
to foreign exchange transactions of the USD against the
EUR, a EUR 18 million increase related to foreign
exchange transactions of the JPY against the EUR, a
EUR 10 million increase related to foreign exchange
transactions of the GBP against the EUR, and a EUR 5
million increase related to foreign exchange
transactions of the AUD against the EUR.
Foreign exchange exposure also arises as a result of
inter-company loans and deposits. Where the
Company enters into such arrangements, the financing
is generally provided in the functional currency of the
subsidiary entity. The currency of the Company’s
external funding and liquid assets is matched with the
required financing of subsidiaries, either directly
through external foreign currency loans and deposits,
or synthetically by using foreign exchange derivatives,
including cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign
exchange forward contracts. In certain cases where

Annual Report 2017

167

Group financial statements 11.9

group companies may also have external foreign
currency debt or liquid assets, these exposures are also
hedged through the use of foreign exchange
derivatives. Changes in the fair value of hedges related
to this exposure are recognized within financial income
and expenses in the statements of income. When such
loans would be considered part of the net investment
in the subsidiary, net investment hedging would be
applied.
Translation exposure of foreign-currency equity
invested in consolidated entities may be hedged. If a
hedge is entered into, it is accounted for as a net
investment hedge. Net current-period change, before
tax, of the currency translation reserve of EUR 1,177
million relates mainly to the negative impact of the
stronger EUR against the foreign currencies of countries
in which Philips’ operations are located. The change in
currency translation reserve was mostly related to the
development of the USD.
As of December 31, 2017, cross-currency interest rate
swaps with a fair value liability of EUR 330 million and
external bond funding for a nominal value of USD 2,535
million were designated as net investment hedges of
our financing investments in foreign operations. During
2017 a total gain of EUR 1.4 million was recognized in
the income statement as ineffectiveness on net
investment hedges.
The total net fair value of financing derivatives as of
December 31, 2017, was a liability of EUR 326 million.
An instantaneous 10% increase in the value of the EUR
against all currencies would lead to an increase of EUR
213 million in the value of the derivatives, including a
EUR 208 million increase related to the USD.
As of December 31, 2016, cross-currency interest rate
swaps with a fair value liability of EUR 726 million and
external bond funding for a nominal value of USD 3,774
million were designated as net investment hedges of
our financing investments in foreign operations. During
2016 a total gain of EUR 0.2 million was recognized in
the income statement as ineffectiveness on net
investment hedges.
The total net fair value of financing derivatives as of
December 31, 2016, was a liability of EUR 728 million.
An instantaneous 10% increase in the value of the EUR
against all currencies would lead to an increase of EUR
53 million in the value of the derivatives, including a
EUR 62 million increase related to the USD.
Philips does not currently hedge the foreign exchange
exposure arising from equity interests in nonfunctional-currency investments in associates and
available-for-sale financial assets.

Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future
cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate
because of changes in market interest rates. Philips had

168

Annual Report 2017

outstanding debt of EUR 4,715 million (2016: EUR 5,606
million), which created an inherent interest rate risk.
Failure to effectively hedge this risk could negatively
impact financial results. At year-end, Philips held EUR
1,939 million in cash and cash equivalents (2016: EUR
2,334 million), and had total long-term debt of EUR
4,044 million (2016: EUR 4,021 million) and total shortterm debt of EUR 672 million (2016: EUR 1,585 million).
At December 31, 2017, Philips had a ratio of fixed-rate
long-term debt to total outstanding debt of
approximately 72%, compared to 47% one year earlier
(figure updated to align definition).
A sensitivity analysis conducted as of January 2018
shows that if long-term interest rates were to decrease
instantaneously by 1% from their level of December 31,
2017, with all other variables (including foreign
exchange rates) held constant, the fair value of the
fixed-rate long-term debt (excluding forward
contracts) would increase by approximately EUR 271
million. If there was an increase of 1% in long-term
interest rates, this would reduce the market value of the
fixed-rate long-term debt (excluding forward
contracts) by approximately EUR 271 million.
If interest rates were to increase instantaneously by 1%
from their level of December 31, 2017, with all other
variables held constant, the annualized net interest
expense would decrease by approximately EUR 12
million. This impact was based on the outstanding net
cash position (after excluding fixed-rate debt) at
December 31, 2017.
A sensitivity analysis conducted as of January 2017
shows that if long-term interest rates were to decrease
instantaneously by 1% from their level of December 31,
2016, with all other variables (including foreign
exchange rates) held constant, the fair value of the
long-term debt would increase by approximately EUR
260 million. If there was an increase of 1% in long-term
interest rates, this would reduce the market value of the
long-term debt by approximately EUR 259 million.
If interest rates were to increase instantaneously by 1%
from their level of December 31, 2016, with all other
variables held constant, the annualized net interest
expense would decrease by approximately EUR 7
million. This impact was based on the outstanding net
cash position (after excluding fixed-rate debt) at
December 31, 2016.

Equity price risk
Equity price risk is the risk that the fair value or future
cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate
because of changes in equity prices.
Philips is a shareholder in some publicly listed
companies, including Philips Lighting and Corindus
Vascular Robotics. As a result, Philips is exposed to
potential financial loss through movements in their
share prices. The aggregate equity price exposure in
such financial assets amounted to approximately EUR

Group financial statements 11.9

1,313 million at year-end 2017 (2016: EUR 36 million).
Philips does not hold derivatives in the abovementioned listed companies. Philips also has
shareholdings in several privately-owned companies
amounting to EUR 397 million, mainly consisting of the
combined businesses in Lumileds and Automotive. As
a result, Philips is exposed to potential value
adjustments.

Commodity price risk
Commodity price risk is the risk that the fair value or
future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate
because of changes in commodity prices.
Philips is a purchaser of certain base metals, precious
metals and energy. Philips may hedge certain
commodity price risks using derivative instruments to
minimize significant, unanticipated earnings
fluctuations caused by commodity price volatility. The
commodity price derivatives that Philips may enter into
are accounted for as cash flow hedges to offset
forecasted purchases. As of December 2017, Philips
does not have any outstanding commodity derivatives.
As of December 2016, Philips did not have any
outstanding commodity derivatives.

Credit risk
Credit risk represents the loss that would be recognized
at the reporting date, if counterparties failed
completely to perform their payment obligations as
contracted. Credit risk is present within Philips trade
receivables. To have better insights into the credit
exposures, Philips performs ongoing evaluations of the
financial and non-financial condition of its customers
and adjusts credit limits when appropriate. In instances
where the creditworthiness of a customer is determined
not to be sufficient to grant the credit limit required,
there are a number of mitigation tools that can be
utilized to close the gap, including reducing payment
terms, cash on delivery, pre-payments and pledges on
assets.

have a strong credit rating from Fitch and Standard &
Poor’s Investor Services. Philips also regularly monitors
the development of the credit risk of its financial
counterparties. Wherever possible, cash is invested and
financial transactions are concluded with financial
institutions with strong credit ratings or with
governments or government-backed institutions.
The table below shows the number of financial
institutions with credit rating A- and above with which
Philips has cash at hand and short-term deposits above
EUR 10 million as of December 31, 2017.

note 28, Fair value of financial assets and liabilities for
details of carrying amounts and fair value.

Country risk
Country risk is the risk that political, legal, or economic
developments in a single country could adversely
impact our performance. The country risk per country is
defined as the sum of the equity of all subsidiaries and
associated companies in country cross-border
transactions, such as intercompany loans, accounts
receivable from third parties and intercompany
accounts receivable. The country risk is monitored on a
regular basis.

Philips invests available cash and cash equivalents with
various financial institutions and is exposed to credit
risk with these counterparties. Philips is also exposed
to credit risks in the event of non-performance by
financial institutions with respect to financial derivative
instruments. Philips actively manages concentration
risk and on a daily basis measures the potential loss
under certain stress scenarios, should a financial
institution default. These worst-case scenario losses
are monitored and limited by the Company.

As of December 31, 2017, the Company had country risk
exposure of EUR 9.3 billion in the United States, EUR
4.4 billion in the Netherlands and EUR 1.3 billion in
China (including Hong Kong). Other countries higher
than EUR 500 million are Japan (EUR 598 million) and
the United Kingdom (EUR 534 million). Germany
exceeded EUR 300 million but was less than EUR 500
million. The degree of risk of a country is taken into
account when new investments are considered. The
Company does not, however, use financial derivative
instruments to hedge country risk.

The Company does not enter into any financial
derivative instruments to protect against default by
financial institutions. However, where possible the
Company requires all financial institutions with which it
deals in derivative transactions to complete legally
enforceable netting agreements under an International
Swap Dealers Association master agreement or
otherwise prior to trading, and whenever possible, to

Philips is covered for a broad range of losses by global
insurance policies in the areas of property damage/
business interruption, general and product liability,
transport, directors’ and officers’ liability, employment
practice liability, crime and cyber security. The
counterparty risk related to the insurance companies
participating in the above-mentioned global insurance

Other insurable risks

policies is actively managed. As a rule, Philips only
selects insurance companies with an S&P credit rating
of at least A-. Throughout the year the counterparty risk
is monitored on a regular basis.
To lower exposures and to avoid potential losses,
Philips has a global Risk Engineering program in place.
The main focus of this program is on property damage
and business interruption risks including company
interdependencies. Regular on-site assessments take
place at Philips locations and business-critical
suppliers by risk engineers of the insurer in order to
provide an accurate assessment of the potential loss
and its impact. The results of these assessments are
shared across the Company’s stakeholders. On-site
assessments are carried out against the predefined Risk
Engineering standards, which are agreed between
Philips and the insurers. Recommendations are made
in a Risk Improvement report and are monitored
centrally. This is the basis for decision-making by the
local management of the business as to which
recommendations will be implemented.
For all policies, deductibles are in place, which vary
from EUR 0.25 million to EUR 5 million per occurrence
and this variance is designed to differentiate between
the existing risk categories within Philips. Above this
first layer of working deductibles, Philips operates its
own re-insurance captive, which during 2017 retained
EUR 2.5 million per occurrence for property damage
and business interruption losses and EUR 5 million in
the aggregate per year. For general and product liability
claims, the captive retained EUR 1.5 million per claim
and EUR 6 million in the aggregate. New contracts were
signed on December 31, 2017, for the coming year,
whereby the re-insurance captive retentions changed.
Property damage and business interruption insurance
is no longer re-insured by the captive and the captive
retention for general, product and cyber liability claims
is set at EUR 5 million per occurrence and EUR 10 million
in the annual aggregate.

Introduction
Statutory financial statements
The sections Group financial statements and Company
financial statements contain the statutory financial
statements of Koninklijke Philips N.V. (the Company).
A description of the Company’s activities and group
structure is included in the Group financial statements.
Accounting policies applied
The financial statements of the Company included in
this section are prepared in accordance with Part 9 of
Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. Section 2:362 (8) of the
Dutch Civil Code, allows companies that apply IFRS as
endorsed by the European Union in their consolidated
financial statements to use the same measurement
principles in their company financial statements. The
Company has prepared these Company financial
statements using this provision.
The accounting policies are described in note 1,
Significant accounting policies of the Group financial
Statements and are deemed incorporated and
repeated herein by reference.
Investments in group companies in the Company
financial statements are accounted for using the equity
method.

Presentation of Company financial
statements
The structure of the Company balance sheets and
Company statements of income are aligned as much as
possible with the Consolidated statements in order to
achieve optimal transparency between the Group
financial statements and the Company financial
statements. Consequently, the presentation of the
Company statements deviates from Dutch regulations.
The Company balance sheet has been prepared before
the appropriation of result.

consolidated amount of current and deferred tax
expense for all members of the fiscal unity. The
effective tax rate increased in 2017 compared to 2016,
mainly due to changes in the contribution of income of
members of the fiscal unity to the total taxable result of
the fiscal unity, as compared to the Company’s
contribution. The effective tax rate in 2017 is low
compared to the Dutch statutory tax rate of 25%, mainly
due to income relating to participations not being

businesses), new acquisitions and the initial recognition
of Philips Lighting as an investment in associate (EUR
1,368 million).

The investments in group companies and associates
are presented as financial fixed assets in the balance
sheet using the equity method, with the exception of
the retained interest in Philips Lighting (presented
under Investments in associates) for which we use the
accounting treatment explained below. Goodwill paid
upon acquisition of investments in group companies or
associates is included in the net equity value of the
investment and is not shown separately on the face of
the balance sheet. Loans provided to group companies
are stated at amortized cost, less impairment.

The line sales/redemptions mainly relates to the
divestment of legal entities belonging to the combined
Lumileds and Automotive businesses, the
deconsolidation of Philips Lighting and internal
restructuring transactions.
The line dividends received represents interim
dividends paid by group companies to Koninklijke
Philips N.V.

Investments in associates represent minority
investments in various companies, with the 29.01%
interest in Philips Lighting being the most notable
investment. The valuation basis for the retained interest
is the lower of the carrying value as per November 28,
2017 based on the closing share price of EUR 32.975
(the date of initial recognition of an investment in
associate in the Company balance sheet) or the value
based on the stock price, less cost to sell, at reporting
date.

The line value adjustments mainly reflects the
adjustment in the value of our retained interest in
Philips Lighting (EUR 104 million).
The line translation adjustments reflects value
adjustments of net invested capital in foreign group
companies and loans to group companies
denominated in other currencies than EUR. The value
decline is mainly due to the lower USD/EUR rate.
A list of investments in group companies, prepared in
accordance with the relevant legal requirements (Dutch
Civil Code, Book 2, Sections 379 and 414), is deposited
at the Chamber of Commerce in Eindhoven,

are held in Treasury for the purpose of (i) delivery upon
exercise of options, restricted and performance share
programs, and (ii) capital reduction, are accounted for
as a reduction of shareholders’ equity. Treasury shares
are recorded at cost, representing the market price on
the acquisition date. When issued, shares are removed
from treasury shares on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis.

shares mainly includes settlements of share-based
compensation plans.

Share repurchase methods for the purposes
of share deliveries under share-based
compensation plans and capital reduction
During 2017, Royal Philips repurchased shares for
covering obligations resulting from past and present
share-based compensation programs via three
different methods: (i) daily share buy-back repurchases
in the open market via an intermediary (ii) repurchase
of shares via forward contracts for future delivery of
shares (iii) the unwinding of call options on own shares.
In 2017, Royal Philips also entered into forward
contracts with several banks to repurchase shares for
capital reduction purposes. The methods (ii) and (iii) are
detailed below.

Forward share repurchase contracts
In order to hedge commitments under share-based
compensation plans, Philips entered into a forward
contract in the first quarter of 2017. This transaction
involved 3 million shares. This resulted in a reduction of
Retained earnings of EUR 81 million against Short-term
liabilities. In 2017, there were three settlements under
the forward share buy-back contract involving
2,250,000 shares, resulting in a EUR 61 million increase
in Retained earnings against Treasury shares. The
remaining 750,000 shares, with a forward price of EUR
27.03, will be repurchased in the first quarter of 2018.
In order to reduce its share capital, Royal Philips also
entered into six forward contracts. In 2017, EUR 998
million was deducted from Retained earnings and was
recorded against Short-term liabilities. The forward
contacts involved 31,020,000 shares with a settlement
date varying between October 2018 and June 2019 and
a weighted average forward price of EUR 32.22. For
further information on the forward contracts please

Annual Report 2017

During 2016 Philips bought EUR and USDdenominated call options to hedge options granted
under share-based compensation plans before 2013.
In 2017, the Company unwound 5,268,741 EURdenominated and 2,661,016 USD-denominated call
options against the transfer of the same number of
Royal Philips shares (7,929,757 shares) and an
additional EUR 160 million cash payment to the buyer
of the call options.
The number of outstanding EUR denominated options
were 3,287,125 and USD-denominated options were
2,974,344 as of December 2017.

Dividend distribution
In June 2017, Philips settled a dividend of EUR 0.80 per
common share, representing a total value of EUR 742
million including costs. Shareholders could elect for a
cash dividend or a share dividend. Approximately 48%
of the shareholders elected for a share dividend,
resulting in the issuance of 11,264,163 new common
shares. The settlement of the cash dividend involved an
amount of EUR 384 million (including costs).
A proposal will be submitted to the 2018 Annual
General Meeting of Shareholders to pay a dividend of
EUR 0.80 per common share, in cash or shares at the
option of the shareholders, against the net income of
the Company for 2017.

Legal reserves
As of December 31, 2017, legal reserves relate to
unrealized losses on available-for-sale financial assets
of EUR 30 million (2016: EUR 36 million), unrealized
gains on cash flow hedges of EUR 23 million (2016: EUR
10 million unrealized losses), ‘affiliated companies’ of
EUR 703 million (2016: EUR 715 million) and unrealized
currency translation gains of EUR 393 million (2016:
EUR 1,234 million unrealized gains).
The item ‘affiliated companies’ relates to the ‘wettelijke
reserve deelnemingen’, which is required by Dutch law.
This reserve relates to any legal or economic
restrictions on the ability of affiliated companies to
transfer funds to the parent company in the form of
dividends.

Company financial statements 12.4

Limitations in the distribution of
shareholders’ equity
As at December 31, 2017, pursuant to Dutch law,
limitations exist relating to the distribution of
shareholders’ equity of EUR 1,306 million. Such
limitations relate to common shares of EUR 188 million,
unrealized gains related to cash flow hedges of EUR 23
million, unrealized currency translation gains of EUR
393 million and ‘affiliated companies’ of EUR 703
million. The unrealized losses related to available-forsale financial assets of EUR 30 million, qualify as a legal
reserve and reduce the distributable amount due to the
fact that this reserve is negative.
As at December, 2016, pursuant to Dutch law,
limitations exist relating to the distribution of
shareholders’ equity of EUR 2,181 million. Such
limitations relate to common shares of EUR 186 million,
as well as available-for-sale financial assets of EUR 36
million, unrealized gains related to cash flow hedges of
EUR 10 million, unrealized currency translation gains of
EUR 1,234 million and ‘affiliated companies’ of EUR 715
million.

The Company has entered into contracts with venture
capitalists where it committed itself to make, under
certain conditions, capital contributions to their
investment funds to an aggregated amount of EUR 83
million (2016: EUR 90 million) until June 30, 2021. As at
December 31, 2017 capital contributions already made
to this investment funds are recorded as available-forsale financial assets within Other non-current financial
assets.
General guarantees as referred to in Section 403, Book
2, of the Dutch Civil Code, have been given by the
Company on behalf of several group companies in the
Netherlands. The liabilities of these companies to third
parties and investments in associates totaled EUR 1,224
million as of year-end 2017 (2016: EUR 1,170 million).
Guarantees totaling EUR 484 million (2016: EUR 667
million) have also been given on behalf of other group
companies. As at December 31, 2017 there have been
no credit guarantees given on behalf of unconsolidated
companies and third parties (2016: also nil).
The Company is the head of a fiscal unity that contains
the most significant Dutch wholly-owned group
companies. The Company is therefore jointly and
severally liable for the tax liabilities of the tax entity as
a whole. For additional information, please refer to

• The company balance sheet as at December 31, 2017
• The company statements of income and changes in

• The notes comprising a summary of the accounting

Basis for our opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Dutch law,
including the Dutch Standards on Auditing. Our
responsibilities under those standards are further
described in the “Our responsibilities for the audit of the
financial statements” section of our report.
We are independent of Koninklijke Philips N.V. in
accordance with the EU Regulation on specific
requirements regarding statutory audit of publicinterest entities, the “Wet toezicht
accountantsorganisaties” (Wta, Audit firms supervision
act), the “Verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van

182

accountants bij assurance-opdrachten” (ViO, Code of
Ethics for Professional Accountants, a regulation with
respect to independence) and other relevant
independence regulations in the Netherlands.
Furthermore we have complied with the “Verordening
gedrags- en beroepsregels accountants” (VGBA, Dutch
Code of Ethics).

Annual Report 2017

Based on our professional judgment we consider an
earnings-based measure as the most appropriate
basis to determine materiality. During our planning
we assessed the benchmark amount, taking into
account the impact of potential divestments and the
anticipated deconsolidation of Philips Lighting in
2017.
Based on the actual benchmark result, the materiality
would exceed the initial planning materiality,
however, we continued to apply a materiality of EUR
60 million
The materiality and applied benchmark are in line
with the 2016 audit.

We have also taken into account misstatements and/or
possible misstatements that in our opinion are material
for the users of the financial statements for qualitative
reasons.
We agreed with the Supervisory Board that
misstatements in excess of EUR 3 million, which are
identified during the audit, would be reported to them,
as well as smaller misstatements that in our view should
be reported on qualitative grounds.
Scope of the group audit
Koninklijke Philips N.V. is at the head of a group of
entities. The consolidated statements of Koninklijke
Philips N.V. represents the financial information of this
group.
Following our assessment of the risk of material
misstatement to Koninklijke Philips N.V.’s group
financial statements, we have selected 9 components
which required an audit of the complete financial
information (Full Scope Components) and 42
components requiring audit procedures on specific
account balances or specified audit procedures that we
considered had the potential for the greatest impact on
the significant accounts in the financial statements,
either because of the size of these accounts or their risk
profile (Specific- or Specified Scope Components).
Although Philips Lighting has been deconsolidated as
of November 2017, for the financial statement audit, it
was assigned as a Full Scope Component. We also
performed audit procedures on certain accounting
areas managed centrally, such as goodwill. In addition,

Company financial statements 12.5

the central audit team has been involved in the audit
procedures on tax and legal claims, litigation and
contingencies.
Where this did not give adequate quantitative coverage
of significant account balances, we used our judgment
to scope additional procedures on account balances or
requested the component auditors to perform
additional specified procedures (Specified
Procedures). As a result of our scoping of the complete
financial information, specific account balances and the
performance of audit procedures at different levels in
the organization, our actual coverage varies per
account balance and the depth of our audit procedures
per account balance varies depending on our risk
assessment.
Of the remaining components, we performed selected
other procedures, including analytical review and
detailed testing to respond to any potential risks of
material misstatements to the financial statements.
Accordingly, our audit coverage 1, for selected account
balance included in the key audit matters stated below,
are summarized as follows:

Component auditors visited the Netherlands in 2017 to
attend our global audit planning conference, to discuss
the Group audit, risks, audit approach and instructions.
In addition, we sent detailed instructions to all
component auditors, covering the significant areas that
should be covered and the information required to be
reported to us. Based on our risk assessment, we visited
component locations in the U.S.A., China, the
Netherlands, Panama, Hong Kong, Germany, India,
France and Israel. These visits encompassed some, or
all, of the following activities: co-developing the
significant risk area audit approach, reviewing key local
working papers and conclusions, meeting with local
and regional leadership teams, obtaining an
understanding of key control processes including
centralized entity level controls processes and
attending closing meetings. We interacted regularly
with the component teams where appropriate during
various stages of the audit, attended in person or via
conference call, Full Scope Component and certain
Specific Scope Component closing meetings, reviewed
key working papers and were responsible for the scope
and direction of the audit process.
By performing the procedures mentioned above at
group entities, together with additional procedures at
group level, we have been able to obtain sufficient and
appropriate audit evidence about the group’s financial
information to provide an opinion about the group
financial statements.

Valuation of Goodwill
Risk

At December 31, 2017, the total carrying value of goodwill amounted to EUR 7,731 million, representing 30,5%
of the group’s total assets. Goodwill is allocated to Cash Generating Units (CGUs) for which management is
required to test the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if there is a
triggering event for testing. We focused on this area given the significant judgment and complexity of
valuation methodologies used to determine whether the carrying value of goodwill is appropriate, which
includes the assumptions used within models to support the recoverable amount of goodwill. Further
reference is made to note 11, Goodwill.

Our audit approach As part of our audit we assessed and tested the assumptions, methodologies and data used by the Company
in their valuation model, by comparing them to external data such as expected inflation rates, discount rates
and implied growth rates. Additionally, we validated that the cash flow projections used in the valuation are
consistent with the information approved by the Executive Committee and have evaluated the historical
accuracy of management’s estimates that drive the assessment, such as business plans and expected growth
rates. We challenged if the identified CGUs are in line with how management monitors the entity’s operations.
Furthermore we reconciled the market value of the Company to the sum of the carrying values of the CGUs.
We included in our team a valuation expert to assist us in these audit activities.
Our main focus was on the CGUs Home Monitoring, Population Health Management and Healthcare
Informatics (all within the Connected Care & Health Informatics segment) as these represent CGUs with
limited headroom. We gained a more in-depth understanding of the developments of the performance of
these CGUs and corroborated if they are in line with forecasted figures. For these CGUs we performed
sensitivity analysis by stress testing key assumptions in the model to consider the degree to which these
assumptions would need to change before an impairment charge would have to be recognized.
We have also tested the effectiveness of the Company’s internal controls around the goodwill accounting
including their prospective financial information (PFI). We also assessed the adequacy of the Company’s
disclosure around goodwill as included in note 11, Goodwill.
Key observations

We consider management’s assumptions to be within an reasonable range.
We note that the Company concluded from its impairment tests that headroom for the CGUs Home
Monitoring, Population Health Management and Healthcare Informatics is relatively limited and thus sensitive
to changes in the assumptions.
We agree with management’s conclusion that no impairment of goodwill is required in 2017. We assessed that
the disclosures in note 11, Goodwill are reasonable.

Valuation and disclosure related to deferred tax assets
Risk

The Company has a significant amount of deferred tax assets, mainly resulting from net operating losses. The
accounting for deferred tax assets is significant to our audit since the Company makes judgments and
estimates of forecasted taxable income in relation to the realization of deferred tax assets.
At December 31, 2017, the deferred tax assets are valued at EUR 1,598 million. Further reference is made to
note 8, Income taxes.

Our audit approach With the involvement of our tax experts we evaluated the tax accounting in various jurisdictions in which the
Company operates, taking into account the impact of the local tax jurisdiction and changes in the respective
tax legislation. Focus area in this respect were the accounting and disclosure implications of the US Tax Cuts
and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017, as the reported amounts are subject to estimation due to
uncertainties relating to the impact of the Act and the modalities of its application.
We tested management’s assumptions used to determine the probability that deferred tax assets recognized
in the balance sheet will be recovered. This is based upon forecasted taxable income in the countries where
the deferred tax assets originated and the periods when the deferred tax assets can be utilized. The forecasts
(based on the Company’s PFI) were evaluated by us and we assessed the historical accuracy of
management’s assumptions.
We have also tested the effectiveness of the Company’s internal controls around the valuation of deferred tax
assets. Substantive audit procedures comprised comparing information provided by management to
corroborative or contradictory information where possible, such as previous history in certain countries. We
also assessed the adequacy of the Company’s disclosures included in note 8, Income taxes.
Key observations

We consider the Company’s accounting policies acceptable and the management assumptions and estimates
to be within the reasonable range.
The impact of the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act amounted to EUR 200 million of which EUR 99 million has been
presented as discontinued operations based on the origin of the deferred tax (backwards tracing).
We assessed that the disclosures in note 8, Income taxes are reasonable.

Revenue recognition – multiple element sales contracts and sales promotions
Risk

Sales contracts for certain transactions primarily entered into in the Diagnosis & Treatment businesses and
the Connected Care & Health Informatics businesses involve multiple elements. Those multiple elements, or
separately identifiable components, are recognized based on their relative fair value and achievement of
revenue recognition criteria. This gives rise to the risk that sales could be misstated due to the complexity of
the multi-element contracts and the incorrect determination of the relative fair value elements and timing of
the related revenue recognition.
In addition, primarily in the Personal Health businesses the Company has sales promotions related
agreements with distributors and retailers whereby discounts and rebates are provided according to the
quantity of goods sold and promotional and marketing activity performed. The agreements of these sales
promotions can include a number of characteristics that require judgment to be applied in determining the
appropriate accounting treatment based on the terms of respective agreements. Management must estimate
the sales related accruals (rebates, marketing and promotional support, coupon and stock protection) as at
the balance sheet date based on forecast information over the term of the promotion. There may also be
incentives to change the timing of when sales related accruals within the Personal Health businesses are
recognized. Further reference is made to note 2, Information by segment and main country.

Our audit approach Our audit procedures included, amongst others, assessing the appropriateness of the Company’s revenue
recognition accounting policies, including the impact of the new revenue recognition accounting standard
(IFRS 15) which will be adopted as of January 1, 2018 and related disclosure as included in note 1, Significant
accounting policies.
We verified the relative fair value determination and we assessed the accuracy of the sales recorded by
inspection of selected sales contracts, external confirmations, review of installation hours reported after
recognition of revenue and inspection of hand over certificates.
With respect to the sales related accruals, our procedures included:
- Testing management’s controls around the completeness and accuracy of the sales promotions
agreements recognized in the accounting system
- Challenging management’s assumptions used in determining the sales related accruals
- Sampling recorded amounts to contractual evidence
- Performing retrospective review of actual expenses verifying there were no significant differences to prior
period sales related accruals
- Testing cut-off through assessing the sales promotion obligations around the year-end
Furthermore we tested the effectiveness of the Company’s controls over the fair value determination of multielement sales contracts and sales promotions to assess the correct value and timing of revenue recognition.
We also assessed the adequacy of the sales disclosures contained in note 2, Information by segment and
main country.
Key observations

We confirm that the Company’s revenue recognition accounting policies were appropriately applied and that
the impact of the new revenue recognition accounting standard (IFRS 15) is appropriately disclosed in note 1,
Significant accounting policies. Furthermore, we have assessed that management’s assumptions are within
the acceptable range. In addition, we assessed that the disclosures in note 2, Information by segment and
main country are reasonable.

Company financial statements 12.5

Valuation and disclosure of accrual estimates for legal claims, litigations, regulatory matters and contingencies
Risk

The Company and certain of its group companies and former group companies are involved as a party in
legal proceedings, including regulatory and other governmental proceedings as well as investigations by
authorities, and a civil matter with the US Department of Justice relating to the external defibrillator business
in the US.
This area is significant to our audit, since the accounting and disclosure for (contingent) legal liabilities is
complex and judgmental (due to the difficulty in predicting the outcome of the matter and estimating the
potential impact if the outcome is unfavorable), and the amounts involved are, or can be, material to the
financial statements as a whole. Further reference is made to note 19, Provisions, and note 24, Contingent
assets and liabilities.

Our audit approach Our audit procedures included, amongst others, testing the effectiveness of the Company’s internal controls
around the identification and evaluation of claims, proceedings and investigations at different levels in the
group, and the recording and continuous re-assessment of the related (contingent) liabilities and provisions
and disclosures. We inquired with both internal and external legal staff as well as with the Company’s
financial staff in respect of ongoing investigations or claims, proceedings and investigations, inspected
relevant correspondence, inspected the minutes of the meetings of the Audit Committee, Supervisory Board
and Executive Committee, requested a confirmation letter from the group’s in-house legal counsel and
obtained external legal confirmation letters from a selection of external legal counsels. For claims settled
during the year, we vouched the cash payments, as appropriate, and read the related settlement agreements
in order to verify whether the settlements were properly accounted for.
Specifically related to ongoing investigations, we were supported by a fraud investigation expert.
We also assessed the adequacy of the Company’s disclosure around legal claims, litigations, regulatory
matters and contingencies as included in note 19, Provisions and note 24, Contingent assets and liabilities.
Key observations

We consider management’s conclusion on the predicted outcome and estimation of potential impact
reasonable and we assessed that the disclosures in note 19, Provisions and note 24, Contingent assets and
liabilities are reasonable.

Acquisitions
Risk

During 2017, the Company acquired ten new entities of which Spectranetics was the most significant
acquisition. The acquisitions involved an aggregated net cash outflow of EUR 2,333 million. These acquisitions
had an aggregated impact on Goodwill and other intangibles of EUR 1,542 million and EUR 926 million
respectively.
The Company was required to recognize assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition-date fair
values. The acquisitions, and more specifically the judgments around the purchase price allocation (PPA)
were significant to our audit.

Our audit approach Our audit procedures included, amongst others, testing the effectiveness of the Company’s internal controls
around the appropriate accounting for acquisitions and valuation of acquired assets and liabilities.
The Company’s management engaged third-party experts to provide valuation, tax and business modelling
support with respect to the determination of the fair values of assets and liabilities under IFRS 3. We included
valuation specialist in our team to assist us with the audit of the PPA.
Our procedures focused primarily on the risks relating to the valuation model, assumptions and judgments
associated with the estimation of the fair value measurements. These included:
- Gaining an understanding through enquiry and review of the valuation methodology adopted by the
Company, and comparing the approach with accepted industry practice
- Assessing the appropriateness of key assumptions such as discount rate and royalty, by comparing them
with external benchmarks and with other areas of the financial statements
- Using our specialist team to assist us in auditing the integrity of the models used in the valuations
- Understanding the value attributed to the cash flow benefits of integrating assets and operations with
those of the Company and validating that these benefits had been attributed appropriately to the asset
valuations
- Confirming existence and valuation of assets acquired
- Determining the acquisition date and verify that result were only included as of the date the Company
obtained control
We also assessed the adequacy of the Company’s disclosure around acquisitions as included in note 4,
Acquisitions and divestments.
Key observations

We were satisfied that management had followed a robust process in the PPA exercise and that it reflected
appropriately the facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date.
We assessed that the disclosures in note 4, Acquisitions and divestments are reasonable.

Disposals and discontinued operations accounting treatment
Risk

In the course of 2017, the Company completed three separate transactions in Philips Lighting shares which
reduced the interest in this company from 71.23% as of December 31, 2016 to 29.01% as of December 31, 2017,
as well as the sale of the majority interest in the combined Lumileds and Automotive businesses.
When reducing the interest in Philips Lighting and the combined Lumileds and Automotive businesses
management determined if and when control was lost. Furthermore, management assessed at what point in
time Philips Lighting should be accounted for as a discontinued operation and as assets held for sale. We
focused in our audit procedures on this area given the significant management judgment involved and the
complexity of the relating accounting. Further reference is made to note 3, Discontinued operations and
assets classified as held for sale.

Our audit approach Our audit procedures included, amongst others, testing the effectiveness of the Company’s internal controls
around the appropriate accounting, assessing the appropriateness of the Company’s accounting policies in
relation to assets held for sale, discontinued operations and the basis of (de)consolidation and assessment of
compliance with the respective accounting policies.
We met with the Board of Management and Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board and other executive
management representatives on a regular basis to understand the status of the planned further sell-down of
Philips Lighting shares. We assessed management’s evaluation of the accounting of the deconsolidation of
Philips Lighting and the sale of combined Lumileds and Automotive businesses including the adequacy of
Company’s disclosures included in note 3, Discontinued operations and assets classified as held for sale.
Key observations

Based on the audit procedures performed we verified that management’s assets held for sale, discontinued
operations and control assessment with respect to the Philips Lighting and the combined Lumileds and
Automotive businesses was adequately and timely performed and correctly accounted for.
Through our audit procedures we have verified that the retained interest of 29.01% in Philips Lighting is
correctly included in assets classified as held for sale as per December 31, 2017.
We assessed that the disclosures in note 3, Discontinued operations and assets classified as held for sale are
reasonable.

In the previous year’s auditor’s report, ‘Company
separation’, ‘Accounting for discontinued operations’
and ‘Initial audit’ were identified as key audit matters.
Since the Company finalised the establishment of two
separate entities (HealthTech and Lighting) in 2016 and
we completed our first year audit, the topics ‘Company
separation’ and ‘Initial audit’ are no longer a key audit
matter. Following the sale of the majority interest of
Lumileds and the further sell-down of Philips Lighting
shares, the accounting of discontinued operations
continued to be an attention area in our audit in 2017,
we included this in the key audit matter ‘Disposals and
discontinued operations accounting treatment’.
Following a number of different acquisitions, of which
Spectranetics is the most significant acquisition in 2017,
a new key audit matter ‘Acquisitions’ is included.

• Contains the information as required by Part 9 of
Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code
We have read the other information. Based on our
knowledge and understanding obtained through our
audit of the financial statements or otherwise, we have
considered whether the other information contains
material misstatements. By performing these
procedures, we comply with the requirements of Part 9
of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code and the Dutch
Standard 720. The scope of the procedures performed
is less than the scope of those performed in our audit
of the financial statements.

Report on other information included in the
annual report

Management is responsible for the preparation of the
other information, including the management report in
accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil
Code and other information pursuant to Part 9 of Book
2 of the Dutch Civil Code.

In addition to the financial statements and our auditor’s
report thereon, the annual report contains other
information that consists of:

Report on other legal and regulatory
requirements

• The management report
• Other information pursuant to Part 9 of Book 2 of the
Dutch Civil Code
• Sustainability statements
• Five year key financial and sustainability information
• Investor relations information

Engagement
Following the appointment by the Annual General
Meeting of Shareholders on May 7, 2015, we were
engaged by the Supervisory Board on October 22, 2015
as auditor of Koninklijke Philips N.V. as of the audit for
the year 2016 and have operated as statutory auditor
since that date.

Based on the following procedures performed, we
conclude that the other information:
• Is consistent with the financial statements and does
not contain material misstatements

Company financial statements 12.5

No prohibited non-audit services
We have not provided prohibited non-audit services as
referred to in Article 5(1) of the EU Regulation on specific
requirements regarding statutory audit of publicinterest entities.

We have exercised professional judgment and have
maintained professional skepticism throughout the
audit, in accordance with Dutch Standards on Auditing,
ethical requirements and independence requirements.
Our audit included e.g.:

Description of responsibilities for the
financial statements

• Identifying and assessing the risks of material
misstatement of the financial statements, whether
due to fraud or error, designing and performing audit
procedures responsive to those risks, and obtaining
audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to
provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not
detecting a material misstatement resulting from
fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as
fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of
internal control

Responsibilities of the Board of Management and
the Supervisory Board for the financial statements
The Board of Management is responsible for the
preparation and fair presentation of the financial
statements in accordance with EU-IFRS and Part 9 of
Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. Furthermore, the Board
of Management is responsible for such internal control
as the Board of Management determines is necessary
to enable the preparation of the financial statements
that are free from material misstatement, whether due
to fraud or error.
As part of the preparation of the financial statements,
the Board of Management is responsible for assessing
the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Based on the financial reporting frameworks
mentioned, the Board of Management should prepare
the financial statements using the going concern basis
of accounting unless the Board of Management either
intends to liquidate the Company or to cease
operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
The Board of Management should disclose events and
circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern in the
financial statements.
The Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the
Company’s financial reporting process.
Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial
statements
Our objective is to plan and perform the audit
assignment in a manner that allows us to obtain
sufficient and appropriate audit evidence for our
opinion.
Our audit has been performed with a high, but not
absolute, level of assurance, which means we may not
have detected all material errors and fraud.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate,
they could reasonably be expected to influence the
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these
financial statements. The materiality affects the nature,
timing and extent of our audit procedures and the
evaluation of the effect of identified misstatements on
our opinion.

Annual Report 2017

• Obtaining an understanding of internal control
relevant to the audit in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances
• Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting
policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates and related disclosures made by
management
• Concluding on the appropriateness of
management’s use of the going concern basis of
accounting, and based on the audit evidence
obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists
related to events or conditions that may cast
significant doubt on the Company’s ability to
continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a
material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw
attention in our auditor’s report to the related
disclosures in the financial statements or, if such
disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion.
Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence
obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report.
However, future events or conditions may cause a
company to cease to continue as a going concern
• Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and
content of the financial statements, including the
disclosures
• Evaluating whether the financial statements
represent the underlying transactions and events in
a manner that achieves fair presentation
Because we are ultimately responsible for the opinion,
we are also responsible for directing, supervising and
performing the group audit. In this respect we have
determined the nature and extent of the audit
procedures to be carried out for group entities. Decisive
were the size and/or the risk profile of the group entities
or operations. On this basis, we selected group entities
for which an audit or review had to be carried out on the
complete set of financial information or specific items.

Company financial statements 12.5

We communicate with the Supervisory Board
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and
timing of the audit and significant audit findings,
including any significant findings in internal control that
we identify during our audit. In this respect we also
submit an additional report to the Audit Committee in
accordance with Article 11 of the EU Regulation on
specific requirements regarding statutory audit of
public-interest entities. The information included in this
additional report is consistent with our audit opinion in
this auditor’s report.
We provide the Supervisory Board with a statement
that we have complied with relevant ethical
requirements regarding independence, and to
communicate with them all relationships and other
matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our
independence, and where applicable, related
safeguards.
From the matters communicated with the Supervisory
Board, we determine those matters that were of most
significance in the audit of the financial statements of
the current period and are therefore the key audit
matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s
report unless law or regulation precludes public
disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare
circumstances, not communicating the matter is in the
public interest.

13 Sustainability statements
13.1 Approach to sustainability reporting
This is our tenth annual integrated financial, social and
environmental report. Philips has a long tradition of
sustainability reporting, beginning with our first
environmental Annual Report published in 1999. This
was expanded in 2003, with the launch of our first
sustainability Annual Report, which provided details of
our social and economic performance in addition to our
environmental results. As a next step, in 2008, we
decided to publish an integrated financial, social and
environmental report. For more information, please
refer to the company’s website.
The sustainability results of Philips Lighting have been
excluded from this report unless otherwise stated.
Royal Philips publishes its integrated Annual Report
with the highest (reasonable) assurance level on the
financial, social and environmental performance. With
that overall reasonable assurance level Philips is a
frontrunner in this field.

13.1.1 Tracking trends
We follow external trends continuously to determine
the issues most relevant for our company and where we
can make a positive contribution to society at large. In
addition to our own research, we make use of a variety
of sources, including the United Nations Environmental
Programme (UNEP), World Bank, World Economic
Forum, World Health Organization, and the World
Business Council for Sustainable Development
(WBCSD). Our work also involves tracking topics of
concern to governments, non-governmental
organizations (NGO), regulatory bodies, academia, and
following the resulting media coverage.

13.1.2 Stakeholders
We derive significant value from our diverse
stakeholders across all our activities and engage with,
listen to and learn from them. Working in partnerships
is crucial in delivering on our vision to make the world
healthier and more sustainable through innovation. We
incorporate their feedback on specific areas of our
business into our planning and actions. In addition, we
participate in meetings and task forces as a member of
organizations including the World Economic Forum,
WBCSD, Responsible Business Alliance (RBA - formerly
known as Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition
(EICC)), the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, and the
European Partnership for Responsible Minerals.
Furthermore, we engage with the leading Dutch labor
union (FNV) and a number of NGOs, including Enough,
GoodElectronics, the Chinese Institute of Public and
Environmental Affairs, UNICEF, Amnesty International,
Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth as well as a variety
of investors and analysts.
Our sustainability e-mail account
(philips.sustainability@philips.com) enables
stakeholders to share their issues, comments and
questions, also about this Annual Report, with the
sustainability team. The table below provides an
overview of the different stakeholder groups, examples

13.1.3 Reporting standards

At the World Economic Forum in January 2017 Philips
signed the Compact for Responsive and Responsible
Leadership. The Compact is an initiative to promote and
align the long-term sustainability of corporations and
the long-term goals of society, with an inclusive
approach for all stakeholders.

We have prepared the integrated annual report in line
with the International Integrated Reporting Council
(IIRC) Integrated Reporting framework and the EU Non
Financial Reporting decree (2014/95/EU). We have also
included a visualization of our value creation process.
For the sustainability information included in the
integrated annual report we followed the Global
Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards-Option
Comprehensive. A detailed overview of the GRI
Comprehensive indicators can be found in the GRI
content index on our sustainability website. Next, we
developed additional company specific indicators. The
information on definition, scope and measurement can
be found in this chapter.

We use this report to communicate on our progress
towards the relevant Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs), in particular SDG 3 (“Ensure healthy lives and
promote well-being for all at all ages”) and SDG 12
(“Ensure sustainable consumption and production
patterns”). Please refer to sub-section 13.3.8,
Stakeholder engagement, of this Annual Report for
more details.

13.1.4 Material topics and our focus

We signed up to the United Nations Global Compact in
March 2007 to advance 10 universal principles in the
areas of human rights, labor, the environment and anticorruption. Our General Business Principles, Human
Rights, Sustainability and Environmental Policies, and
our Supplier Sustainability Declaration are the
cornerstones that enable us to live up to the standards
set by the Global Compact. This is closely monitored
and reported, as illustrated throughout this report,
which is also our annual Communication on Progress
(COP) submitted to the UN Global Compact Office.

We identify the environmental, social, and governance
topics which have the greatest impact on our business
and the greatest level of concern to stakeholders along
our value chain. Assessing these topics enables us to
prioritize and focus upon the most material topics and
effectively address these in our policies and programs.
Our materiality assessment is based on an ongoing
trend analysis, media search, and stakeholder input. In
2017, we conducted a survey among a diverse
stakeholder group and presented the findings during
the subsequent stakeholder event. The results for Royal
Philips are reflected in the materiality matrix below.

The business impact scores are based on Philips’ assessment. Our materiality assessment
has been conducted in the context of the GRI Sustainable Reporting Standards and the
results have been reviewed and approved by the Philips Sustainability Board. As Philips
aspires to become a leading health technology company, we noted a number of aspects
that changed in terms of materiality in the table below (compared to 2016), for example,
health-related aspects like access to healthcare and patient safety have become more
material.

Annual Report

With the new 5-year ‘Healthy people, sustainable
planet’ program, new sustainability commitments were
introduced; more detailed targets can be found in the
respective sections.

Our sustainability performance reporting encompasses
the consolidated Philips Group activities in the Social
and Environmental Performance sections, following
the consolidation criteria detailed in this section. As a
result of impact assessments of our value chain we
have identified the material topics, determined their
relative impact in the value chain (supply chain, our
own operations, and use phase of our products) and
reported for each topic on the relevant parts of the
value chain. More details are provided in the relevant
sections in the Sustainability Statements.
The consolidated selected financial information in this
sustainability statements section has been derived
from the Group Financial Statements, which are based
on IFRS.

13.1.7 Comparability and completeness
We used expert opinions and estimates for some parts
of the Key Performance Indicator calculations. There is
therefore an inherent uncertainty in our calculations,
e.g. Lives Improved and Environmental Profit and Loss
account. The figures reported are Philips’ best estimate.
As our insight increases, we may enhance the
methodology in the future.

Annual Report 2017

Sustainability statements 13.1.7

Social data cover all employees, including temporary
employees, but exclude contract workers. Due to the
implementation of new HRM systems, we are able to
provide more specific exit information on Philips
employees from 2014 onwards.
Until 2016, Philips reported on Green Product sales.
Due to the change in our businesses, we changed this
in 2016 to Green Revenues, which includes products
and solutions (refer to the definition in 12.1.8). Revenues
for 2014 and 2015 have been restated to reflect this
change.
In 2017 the emission factor set for consumed electricity
was updated to the IEA 2016 publications. Also, the
emission factors for natural gas were implemented
according to latest 2017 DEFRA factor set (UK
Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs).
Lastly, all scope 3 emission factors for business travel
and logistics were updated from a bespoke emission
factor set to DEFRA 2017 guidance as well.
The emissions of substances data is based on
measurements and estimates at manufacturing site
level. The figures reported are Philips’ best estimate.
The integration of newly acquired activities is
scheduled according to a defined integration timetable
(in principle, the first full reporting year after the year of
acquisition) and subject to the integration agenda. Data
for activities that are divested during the reporting year
are not included in full-year reporting. Environmental
data are reported for manufacturing sites with more
than 50 industrial employees.
We have excluded Philips Lighting data from the
consolidated sustainability data, except for Lives
Improved.

13.1.8 Data definitions and scope
Lives improved and materials
The Key Performance Indicators on ‘lives improved’
and ‘materials’ and the scope are defined in the
respective methodology documents that can be found
at Methodology for calculating Lives Improved. We
used opinions from Philips experts and estimates for
some parts of the Lives Improved calculations.
Health and safety
Health and safety data is reported by sites with over 50
FTEs (full-time equivalents) and is voluntary for smaller
locations. Health and safety data are reported and
validated each month via an online centralized IT tool.
The Total Recordable Cases (TRC) rate is defined as a
KPI for work-related cases where the injured employee
is unable to work one or more days, or had medical
treatment or sustained an industrial illness. We also
provide the Lost Workday Injury Cases (LWIC) rate,
which measures work-related injuries and illnesses that
predominantly occur in manufacturing operations and
Field Services Organizations where the incident leads

194

Annual Report 2017

to at least one lost workday. Fatalities are reported for
staff, contractors and visitors. The TRC and LWIC KPIs
refer to all reported cases.
General Business Principles
Alleged GBP violations are registered in our intranetbased reporting and validation tool.
Sustainable Revenues
Sustainable Revenues are revenues generated through
products and solutions that address the United Nations
Sustainable Development Goals 3 (“to ensure healthy
lives and promote well-being for all at all ages”) or 12
(“to ensure sustainable consumption and production
patterns”) and include all Diagnosis & Treatment and
Connected Care & Health Informatics revenues. Next,
Green Revenues and non-Green revenues that
contribute to healthy living at Personal Health are
included.
Green Revenues
Green Revenues are revenues generated through
products and solutions that offer a significant
environmental improvement in one or more Green
Focal Areas: Energy efficiency, Packaging, Hazardous
substances, Weight, Circularity and Lifetime reliability.
For healthcare equipment, remote serviceability is
another Green Focal Area. The lifecycle approach is
used to determine a product’s overall environmental
improvement. It calculates the environmental impact of
a product over its total life cycle (raw materials,
manufacturing, product use and disposal).
Green products and solutions need to prove leadership
in at least one Green Focal Area compared to industry
standards, which is defined by a specific peer group.
This is done either by outperforming reference products
(which can be a competitor or predecessor product in
the particular product family) by at least 10%,
outperforming product-specific eco-requirements or
by being awarded a recognized eco-performance
label. Because of their different product portfolios,
segments have specified additional criteria for Green
products and solutions, including product-specific
minimum requirements where relevant.
Circular Revenues
Circular Revenues are defined by revenues generated
through products and solutions that meet specific
Circular Economy requirements. These include
performance and access-based business models,
refurbished, reconditioned and remanufactured
products and systems, refurbished, reconditioned and
remanufactured components, upgrades or
refurbishment on site or remote, and products
containing at least 30% recycled plastics.
Sustainable Innovation
Sustainable Innovation is the Research & Development
spend related to the development of new generations
of products and solutions that address the United
Nations Sustainable Development Goals 3 (“to ensure

Sustainability statements 13.1.8

healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages”)
or 12 (“to ensure sustainable consumption and
production patterns”). This includes all Diagnosis &
Treatment and Connected Care & Health Informatics
innovation spend. Next, innovation spend that
contributes to Green Products and healthy living at
Personal Health is included. Finally, innovation spend
at HealthTech Other that addresses the SDGs 3 and 12
is included.
Green Innovation
Green Innovation is a subset of Sustainable Innovation
and is defined as all R&D activities directly contributing
to the development of Green Products and Solutions or
Green Technologies; it contributes to SDG 12. This
means all products, systems or services that
demonstrate a measurable positive impact on energy
efficiency (10% or greater than previous products or
legal requirements), and preferably also in one or more
green focal areas: Circularity, Weight & Materials,
Packaging, and Substances.
Environmental data
All environmental data from manufacturing operations,
except process chemicals, are reported on a quarterly
basis in our sustainability reporting and validation tool,
according to company guidelines that include
definitions, procedures and calculation methods.
Process chemicals are reported on a half-yearly basis.
Internal validation processes have been implemented
and peer audits performed to ensure consistent data
quality and to assess the robustness of data reporting
systems.
These environmental data from manufacturing are
tracked and reported to measure progress against our
Sustainable Operations targets.
Reporting on ISO 14001 certification is based on
manufacturing units reporting in the sustainability
reporting system.
Environmental Profit & Loss account
The Philips Environmental Profit & Loss (EP&L) account
measures our environmental impact on society at large.
The EP&L account is based on Life Cycle Analysis
methodology in which the environmental impacts are
expressed in monetary terms using specific conversion
factors. For more information we refer to our
methodology report .
Operational carbon footprint
Philips reports in line with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol
(GHGP). The GHGP distinguishes three scopes, as
described below. The GHGP requires businesses to
report on the first two scopes to comply with the GHGP
reporting standards. As per the updated GHGP Scope 2
reporting guidance, from 2015 onward our scope 2
emissions reporting includes both the market-based

method and the location-based method. The marketbased method of reporting will serve as our reference
for calculating our total operational carbon footprint.
• Scope 1 – direct CO2e emissions – is reported on in
full, with details of direct emissions from our
industrial and non-industrial sites. Emissions from
industrial sites, which consist of direct emissions
resulting from processes and fossil fuel combustion
on site, are reported in the sustainability reporting
system. Energy use and CO2e emissions from nonindustrial sites are based on actual data where
available. If this is not the case, they are estimated
based on average energy usage per square meter,
taking the geographical location and building type of
the site into account.
• Scope 2 – indirect CO2e emissions – is reported on in
full, with details of indirect emissions from our
industrial and non-industrial sites. CO2e emissions
resulting from purchased electricity, steam, heat and
other indirect sources are reported in the
sustainability reporting system. The indirect
emissions of sites not yet reporting are calculated in
the same manner as described in Scope 1.
• The location-based method of scope 2 reporting
reflects the average emissions intensity of grids on
which energy consumption occurs (using mostly
grid-average emission factor data). For this
method our emission factors derive from the
International Energy Agency (IEA) 2016 and are
based on grid averages.
• The market-based method of scope 2 reporting
allows use of an emission factor that is specific to
the energy purchased. The emissions intensity of
consumed energy can differ according to the
contractual instruments used. For example, socalled ‘green electricity contracts’ guarantee the
purchaser will be supplied with electricity from
renewable sources, which typically lowers
emissions per energy unit generated. In the
market-based method Philips will account for
renewable electricity with an emission factor of 0
grams CO2e per kWh. All renewable electricity
claimed by Philips is sourced from the same energy
market where the electricity-consuming
operations are located, and is tracked and
redeemed, retired, or cancelled solely on behalf of
Philips. All certificates were obtained through
procurement of Green-e certified Renewable
Energy Certificates (RECs) in the United States and
European Guarantees of Origin (GOs) from the
Association of Issuing Bodies (AIB) of the European
Energy Certificate System (EECS). To ensure the
additionality, all certificates are produced in 2017
and a maximum of 6 months prior in the country of
consumption and are retired on behalf Royal
Philips.
• Scope 3 – other CO2e emissions related to activities
not owned or controlled by the Royal Philips – is
reported on for our business travel and distribution
activities.

Annual Report 2017

195

Sustainability statements 13.1.8

The Philips operational carbon footprint (Scope 1, 2 and
3) is calculated on a quarterly basis and includes the
emissions from our:

Employee Engagement Index (EEI)
The Employee Engagement Index (EEI) is the single
measure of the overall level of employee engagement
at Philips. It is a combination of perceptions and
attitudes related to employee satisfaction,
commitment and advocacy.

• Industrial sites – manufacturing and assembly sites
• Non-industrial sites – offices, warehouses, IT centers
and R&D facilities
• Business travel – lease and rental cars and airplane
travel
• Logistics – air, ocean and road transport
All emission factors used to transform input data (for
example, amount of tonne-kilometers transported) into
CO2 emissions have been updated to the DEFRA (UK
Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs) 2017
and the IEA emission factor set 2016. The total CO2
emission resulting from these calculations serves as
input for scope 1, 2 and 3.

The reported 2016 and 2017 figures are based on the
My Accelerate Survey at Royal Philips. This survey is
conducted by Expert Training Systems (ETS). The total
score of the employee engagement is an average of the
quarterly results of the survey. The results are
calculated by taking the average of the answered
questions of the surveys.

13.1.9 Sustainability governance

Commuting by our employees, upstream distribution
(before suppliers ship to us), outsourced activities and
emissions resulting from product use by our customers
are not included in our operational carbon footprint.
The calculations for business travel by lease car are
based on actual fuel usage and for travel by rental car
the emissions are based on the actual mileage. Taxis
and chauffeur driven cars used for business travel are
not included in the calculations. Emissions from
business travel by airplane are calculated by the
supplier based on mileage flown and emission factors
from DEFRA, distinguishing between short, medium
and long-haul flights. Furthermore, emissions from air
freight for distribution are calculated based on the
amount of tonne-kilometers transported between
airports (distinguishing between short, medium and
long-haul flights), including an estimate (based on
actual data of the lanes with the largest volumes) for
trucking from sites and distribution centers to airports
and vice versa. Express shipments are generally a mix
of road and air transport, depending on the distance. 13.1.10
It is therefore assumed that shipments across less than
600 km are transported by road and the rest by air
(those emissions by air are calculated in the same way
as air freight). For sea transport, only data on
transported volume were available so an estimate had
to be made about the average weight of a container.
Transportation to and from ports is not registered. This
fore and aft part of sea transport was estimated to be
around 3% of the total distance (based on actual data
of the lanes with the largest volumes), consisting of a
mix of modalities, and was added to the total emissions
accordingly. CO2e emissions from road transport were
also calculated based on tonne-kilometers. Return
travel of vehicles is not included in the data for sea and
road distribution.

Annual Report 2017

Sustainability is strongly embedded in our core
business processes, like innovation (EcoDesign),
sourcing (Supplier Sustainability Program),
manufacturing (Sustainable Operations) and Logistics
(Green Logistics) and projects like the Circular Economy
initiative.
In Royal Philips, the Sustainability Board is the highest
governing sustainability body and is chaired by the
Chief Strategy & Innovation Officer, who is a member of
the Executive Committee. Three other Executive
Committee members sit on the Sustainability Board
together with segment and functional executives. The
Sustainability Board convenes four times per year,
defines Philips’ sustainability strategy, programs and
policies, monitors progress and takes corrective action
where needed.
Progress on Sustainability is communicated internally
and externally (www.results.philips.com) on a quarterly
basis and at least annually in the Executive Committee
and Supervisory Board.

Total purchased goods and services as included in cost
of sales amounted to EUR 9.6 billion, representing 54%
of total revenues of the Philips Group. Of this amount,
approximately 75% was spent with global suppliers, the
remainder with local suppliers.
In 2017, salaries and wages totaled EUR 4.9 billion. This
amount is some EUR 430 million higher than in 2016,
mainly caused by the increased number of employees,
also resulting from acquisitions. See note 6, Income
from operations for more information.
Philips’ shareholders were given EUR 742 million in the
form of a dividend, the cash portion of which amounted
to EUR 384 million.
Income taxes amounted to EUR 349 million, compared
to EUR 203 million in 2016. The effective income tax rate
in 2017 was 25.3%, compared to 19.9% in 2016. For more
information, see note 8, Income taxes.
Philips supports global initiatives of the OECD
(Organization for Economic Cooperation and

transparency and responsible tax management, taking
into account the interests of various stakeholders, such
as governments, shareholders, customers and the
communities in which Philips operates. For more
information, please refer to Philips’ Tax Principles.

13.3 Social statements
In 2016, Royal Philips launched its next 5-year
sustainability programs. This section provides
additional information on (some of) the Social
performance parameters reported in section 3.2, Social
performance, of this Annual Report.

13.3.1 People development
Philips is on a multi-year journey to evolve our culture
to focus on experience-based career development,
giving our people the opportunity to identify and gain
the experiences necessary to support our health
technology strategy and strengthen their
employability. This year we have continued taking
experimental learning to a new level across our
70:20:10 approach.
In 2017, more than 1,200 new courses were made
available by Philips University. By year-end, some
67,000 employees had enrolled for courses with

Philips University. In total, over 830,000 hours were
spent on training through Philips University in 2017, with
over 570,000 training completions.
70% Critical career experiences
We focus our efforts to support our people in navigating
their own career and stimulate and educate our
managers to have meaningful career dialogues with
their people. To that end, we have created a new tool,
Experience Maps. They describe the experiences
people can gain to prepare for or develop in critical
roles. We have identified 45 roles according to the
following criteria: key to deliver on our strategy, roles
our people aspire to be in, and roles with multi
incumbents.
These maps are created as a tool for employees and
managers to use during development dialogues and for
employees to explore when thinking about career
steps, how to gain experience to be ready for these
roles. By identifying the roles and experiences critical
to our business strategy, we clarify development areas
and transferrable skills in support of cross-functional,
lateral, traditional, as well as non-traditional career
opportunities for our people. The career maps guide
experience but we have also aligned them with our
courses and learning as made available by Philips
University.
We have integrated the experience maps into our talent
development approach, enabling and empowering our
people with real-time, integrated tools and resources
to help them plan and manage their career. We also
build awareness of experience-based careers for our
people through stories and communications,
prioritizing critical roles and capabilities that are directly
in support of our health technology strategy.
We continue to stimulate cross-moves (across
businesses, between markets or functions) to promote
collaboration and give people challenging learning
experiences.
20% Coaching and mentoring
In 2017, Philips University launched a program for
leaders, enabling them to better support people’s
growth through meaningful career conversations.
Coaching and mentoring are also an integral part of all
our leadership development programs across all levels
of leadership, starting with the transition from
individual contributor to first time frontline leader. Our
goal is to build coaching capabilities in our leadership
population to support leaders in building talent within
their teams. As part of our Senior Women in Leadership
program, leaders mentor female emerging leaders as
application practice throughout their learning journey.
In 2018 we will drive further initiatives focused on:
• Strengthening the employee career partnership with
clear accountabilities

over 46,000 target software recruits in 2017, further
strengthening digital talent pipelines and increasing
hires from defined target companies.
• In response to the increasing competition for top
talent, and candidate feedback, we invested in
improving the most influential touchpoints in the
candidate decision journey. Enhancements included
mandatory candidate experience training for all
recruiters, a differentiating employer brand content
strategy, and the launch of a new global career
website platform. The new platform leverages
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and modern web
technologies to deliver a more personalized, and
candidate-centric digital experience. Since launch,
the new platform has generated over 875,000 visits
to the global site.

10% Learning programs
In 2017, Philips University embarked on a journey of
transformation. By further optimizing the way learning
is offered at Philips, Philips University works to unleash
its potential as a world-class learning provider and to
deliver upon its mission of a lifetime of learning in
Philips. By mirroring learning requests to companywide strategic priorities and introducing smarter ways
of working, we commit to deliver meaningful learning
solutions that truly impact our people and Philips as a
whole. We continue to explore and implement

treated with the appropriate and affordable
commodities.

13.3.4 Building employability
At Philips, our vision to offer the best place to work for
people who share our passion is not limited to our
employees. In a number of our geographies, we support
social initiatives to increase employability. This year we
are highlighting a UK example, where we have been
working with the halow project, which nurtures the
independence of individuals with learning disabilities.

13.3.5 The Philips Foundation
The Philips Foundation is a registered charity
established in 2014 as a platform for the worldwide
societal activities of Philips. It has now evolved to
support the Sustainable Development Goals 3 (Ensure
healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages)
and 17 (Revitalize the global partnership for sustainable
development) by deploying what Philips is best at.
Royal Philips supported the programs of the Philips
Foundation in 2017 and provided the operating staff as
well as the expert support of skilled employees for
support in the Foundation’s programs.
The Philips Foundation’s mission has been
reformulated in 2017 to reduce healthcare inequality by
providing access to quality healthcare for
disadvantaged communities. We do this through the
provision and application of Philips’s healthcare and
personal care expertise, innovation power, talent and
resources and by financial support. Together with key
partners around the globe, the Philips Foundation
seeks to identify the challenges where a combination
of Philips expertise and partner experience can be used
to create meaningful solutions that impact people’s
lives.
In 2017 The Philips Foundation exceeded the number
of 100 projects throughout the world, engaging
employees and connecting with patients and
underserved communities on healthcare. 33 local

projects were approved in 2017 throughout all
geographical markets, along all phases of the
healthcare continuum: from education on healthy living
and prevention, to diagnosis and treatment, deploying
Philips’ expertise and skills. Across 19 countries Philips
Foundation supported 28 local non-governmental
organizations, working with Philips employees to
improve healthcare access and availability for people
as well as personal care.
In addition, in 2017 Philips Foundation continued
working with global organizations. While assessing
poorly functioning healthcare facilities, we deployed an
alpha release of an assessment mobile application and
a minimal cloud-based backend in collaboration with
the Ministry of Health and UNICEF in facilities located
in Kakamega and Nairobi in Kenya. Our partnership
with United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) is
ongoing with the Maker Project in Kenya, leveraging our
capabilities to create sustainable innovative solutions
to maternal and child healthcare issues.
In collaboration with the International Committee of the
Red Cross (ICRC) and the Netherlands Red Cross we
developed a toolkit for healthcare workers in SubSaharan Africa. The toolkit aims to mitigate the most
prominent health risks faced during pregnancy and
promotes ways to maintain a healthy lifestyle. This is
part of larger efforts to innovate with the ICRC to
optimize maternal care in fragile environments. A next
project, working specifically with the Netherlands Red
Cross and Ivory Coast Red Cross, will build the
Community Life Centers and improve community
healthcare in Ivory Coast.
We committed to donate scanning equipment to Mercy
Ships, which brings in floating professional hospital
care to the benefit of people in remote areas in Africa.
We started studying sustainability models around
healthcare facilities in primary care to ensure long term
availability with Amref Health Africa. The Philips
Foundation will donate Children’s Automatic
Respiratory Monitors to Management Sciences for
Health (MSH) that works shoulder-to-shoulder with
countries and communities to save lives and improve
the health of the world’s poorest and most vulnerable
people by building strong, resilient, sustainable health
systems. This is part of their application to USAID to
fund an Integrated Health Project (IHP) in DR Congo.
With Ashoka the Philips Foundation started a multiyear effort to unleash the power of social innovation to
reduce health inequality. In the program, the Philips
Foundation supports a number of social entrepreneurs
selected for their visionary solutions to improve access
to healthcare for those who lack access. The
entrepreneurs are connected to experienced Philips
employees through several programs, aimed at scaling
the impact of their healthcare solutions and at cocreating new models for business and social value.

13.3.6 General Business Principles
In 2017, a total of 382 concerns were reported via the
Philips Ethics Line and through our network of GBP
Compliance Officers. The previous reporting period
(2016) saw a total of 339 concerns, resulting in an
increase of 13% in the number of reports.
This is a continuation of the upward trend reported
since 2014, the year in which Philips updated its General
Business Principles and deployed a strengthened
global communication campaign. We believe this trend
continues to be in line with our multi-year efforts to
encourage our employees to speak up.
The upward trend in the number of concerns can be
attributed primarily to more concerns being reported in
North America, which now accounts for 49% of the total
number of complaints (2016: 38%). The number of
concerns reported in the Asia-Pacific region (APAC
region) and in Europe, Middle East & Africa (EMEA
region) remained quite stable, accounting for 20% and
21% of the total number of complaints respectively in
2017 (2016: 24% and 20%). The concerns reported in
Latin America declined to 10% of the total number of
complaints, compared with 19% in 2016.

Most common types of concerns reported
Treatment of employees
As in previous years, the type of concern most
commonly reported related to the category ‘Treatment
of employees’. In 2017 there were 211 reports in this
category, compared to 179 in 2016. This represents 55%
of the total number of concerns, which is only a slight
increase on 2016 (53%).
The majority of the concerns reported in the ‘Treatment
of employees’ category relate to ‘Respectful treatment’
and ‘Equal and fair treatment’ (64%). The ‘Respectful
treatment’ category generally relates to concerns about
verbal abuse, (sexual) harassment, and hostile work
environments. ‘Equal and fair treatment’ primarily
addresses favoritism, matters of discrimination and
unfair treatment in the workplace. In these categories,
73% of the cases originate from the Americas, which is
slightly more than in 2016 (72%).

Business integrity
The second-most reported type of concern relates to
‘Business Integrity’, which accounted for 27% of total
cases reported in 2017. This is slightly less than in 2016,
when the percentage was 29%. These concerns
originated primarily from the APAC region (44%),
followed by EMEA (28%), Latin America (16%) and North
America (12%).
Substantiated/unsubstantiated concerns
Of the 382 cases reported in 2017, 95 are still pending
closure, in particular those that were filed towards the
end of the year. The table below gives an overview of
the number of reported concerns that were
substantiated (i.e. were found to constitute a breach of
our General Business Principles) by the subsequent
investigation.
Of the 287 reports closed in 2017 (241 in 2016), 91 were
substantiated, which represents 32% of the total
number reported and closed (30% in 2016). This is also
shown in the table below. Notably, while 31% of the
Treatment of employee cases were substantiated in
2016, this percentage dropped to 26% in 2017 (2015:
42%, 2014: 28%). Similarly, 42% of the Business Integrity
reports were closed as substantiated in 2017, compared
with 30% in 2016 (2015: 18%, 2014: 33%).
In addition to the above, 117 concerns that were still
open at the end of 2016 were closed during the course
of 2017. 44% of these concerns were substantiated after
investigation.
Of the 143 substantiated concerns closed in 2017, 77
were followed up with disciplinary measures ranging
from termination of employment and written warnings
to training and coaching. In other cases corrective
action was taken, which varied from strengthening the
business processes to increasing awareness of the
expected standard of business conduct.

13.3.7 Health and Safety performance
In 2017 we focused on four main areas of Health and
Safety:
Policy and Procedures. The CEO signed the new H&S
policy and under it the existing standards are being
consolidated and upgraded into a common format to
provide guidance in a simple, consistent Management
System format.
Structure and Responsibility. The Health and Safety
structure to support the operational sites and the Field
Service organizations was improved and focused on
providing support to all Philips activities more directly.
Within this a program to upskill H&S professionals was
implemented to provide better internal development
opportunities.

standards using verifiable evidence to provide greater
depth of analysis. We saw improved performance at
sites as a result and one site achieved an 85% accident
reduction rate following this enhanced process.
Cultural Change. We continued to focus our efforts on
a proactive cultural transformation through Behavior
Based Safety (BBS). BBS requires a fundamental shift
in how we think about and act on Health and Safety
before an injury occurs. Our new company program,
based on an internal best practice, was deployed and
implemented globally across many factories in 2017
including those in China, Europe and the USA. At one
pilot site we saw accidents reduced by 75% following
the introduction of the BBS program. We believe this
program will continue to drive down our workplace
injuries and be a key pillar towards reaching our goal of
a 25% reduction in total injuries by 2020.
Metrics. In 2017 we implemented proactive metrics to
support the more traditional Reactive metrics (TRC and
LWIC) and we completed over 14,000 safety Gemba
Walks and 22,900 Safety Kaizen activities. This
approach is also designed to support cultural change
and drive safety into routine management activity.
In 2017, we recorded 234 TRCs (239 in 2016), i.e. cases
where the injured employee is unable to work one or
more days, or had medical treatment, or sustained an
industrial illness.

Personal Health businesses
The Personal Health businesses segment showed a
decrease in performance in Health and Safety with 24
LWIC in 2017, compared to 21 in 2016. The LWIC rate
increased from 0.15 in 2016 to 0.17 in 2017. The Personal
Health businesses segment had 38 recordable cases in
2017 (46 in 2016), mainly driven by fewer cases in our
factory in the USA.
Diagnosis & Treatment businesses
In the Diagnosis & Treatment businesses segment
Health and Safety showed an increase in performance
in 2017 with 33 LWIC compared to 40 in 2016. The LWIC
rate decreased to 0.27 compared to 0.36 in 2016. The
total number of recordable cases for the Diagnosis &
Treatment businesses segment was 70 (73 in 2016),
mainly driven by our factories in the Netherlands and
Costa Rica.
Connected Care & Health Informatics businesses
Health and Safety performance in the Connected Care
& Health Informatics businesses segment was stable in
2017 with 5 LWIC in 2017, the same number as in 2016.
Correspondingly, the LWIC rate remained at 0.15 in
2017. The total number of recordable cases for the
Connected Care & Health Informatics businesses
segment was 20 (23 in 2016).

13.3.8 Stakeholder engagement
Our engagement with various partners and
stakeholders is essential to our vision of making the
world healthier and sustainable through innovation.
Some of our partnership engagements are described
below.

Global partnerships
World Economic Forum
Philips is proud to continue as a strategic partner of the
World Economic Forum (WEF), an International
Organization for Public-Private
Cooperation committed to improving the state of the
world. The Forum engages the foremost political,
business and other leaders of society to shape global,
regional and industry agendas.
In addition to the Annual Meeting in Davos, we
supported and participated in a wide range of initiatives
and projects throughout the year – regional WEF
events in Latin America and ASEAN, continued
involvement in initiatives such as Shaping the Future of
Health and Healthcare and Shaping the Future of
Digital Economy and Society, as well as participation in
the International Business Council of the World
Economic Forum.
Through his co-chairmanship of the PACE (Platform for
Accelerating the Circular Economy) initiative, Philips
CEO Frans van Houten announced a pledge that Philips
aims to take back all capital equipment from our
hospital clients.

Annual Report 2017

Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization
Philips and the Global Alliance for Vaccines and
Immunization are partnering to improve the quality of
immunization data and its collection in primary and
community healthcare. The partnership will be piloting
a project in Uganda with the goal of gathering accurate
healthcare data to provide access to care at lower costs,
improve patient outcomes, and reduce costs. Good
data is key to strengthening health systems around the
world.
World Heart Federation
Philips continued their partnership with the World
Heart Federation (WHF) in 2017 to help people better
manage their heart health. Aligned with the WHF’s
‘power your life’ campaign, Philips aims to encourage
people to take personal responsibility for leading
heart-healthy lives and to raise awareness about
cardiovascular disease.

Thought leadership
Future Health Index
The Future Health Index (FHI) is Philips’ flagship
research platform to understand perceptions of
connected care technology and the role it plays in the
future of healthcare. Launched in 2016, it is a
comprehensive record of where we are on the road to
better outcomes achieved at lower cost, examining
perceptions of main users of health systems and
investigating how technology is transforming lives
around the world, thereby using data from
organizations such as the World Health Organization,
World Bank and IDC. In 2018 the Future Health Index
will continue to work with the industry’s brightest minds
with a focus on demonstrating how connected care
technologies are, and should be, used to accelerate
value-based healthcare.
Digital Health Society
Philips is part of the EU ecosystem - Digital Health
Society (DSH). The DHS network, initiated in October
2017 by the then-Estonian Presidency of the Council of
the European Union, includes main EU key
stakeholders: policy-makers, citizens, health
professionals, scientists, companies and payers. Its
main objective is to identify current main challenges for
the deployment of digital health and to devise ways
and initiatives to achieve it.
The four main topics cover:
• Convergence on interoperability standards and
digital tele healthcare protocol
• Data donors and citizen-controlled data governance
• Legal framework facilitating the free flow of data and
the 2nd use of data
• Digital transformation and change management in
health and social care organizations

Sustainability statements 13.3.8

We believe that such a multi-stakeholder approach is
an effective method to achieve the Digital Single Market
in the EU.

Working on global issues
Sustainable Development Goals
Philips aspires to be a major private sector contributor
to The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs). Philips is committed to working closely with all
relevant stakeholders to develop solutions to address
SDG 3 (“to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being
for all at all ages”) and SDG 12 (“to ensure sustainable
consumption and production patterns”).
Throughout the year we ran two campaigns with
DEVEX, a social enterprise and media platform for the
global development community. Philips led a 10-week
dialogue series with European Investment Bank,
International Finance Corporation and UNDP on how to
boost and improve Public Private Partnerships (PPPs)
as a financial instrument to achieve the SDGS. The
DEVEX editorial team covered HealthMap Diagnostics,
a joint venture between Manipal Health Enterprises
and Philips in Haryana, India.
Our second campaign with DEVEX focused on the
importance of quality primary healthcare to achieve the
goal of Universal Health Coverage. We partnered with
the WHO, IFPMA, IFRC and UNICEF among others. As
part of the Philips coverage, the DEVEX editorial team
travelled to Jayapura, Indonesia to discover more
about our Mobile Obstetrician Monitoring solution.
Frans van Houten was also interviewed as part of the
dialogue on the importance of taking a holistic view of
healthcare.
In the 2017 UN General Assembly, our CEO Frans van
Houten, Chief HR Officer Ronald de Jong and Chief of
International Markets Henk de Jong joined a number of
events including WEF’s inaugural Summit on
Sustainable Development Impact. There, we shared our
pledge to improve the lives of 300 million people a year
in underserved healthcare communities by
2025 recognizing the often-critical needs of women
and children in many communities.
In the framework of the UNGA week, Philips sponsored
the Social Good Summit in New York, where it launched
in 15 countries its Better Me, Better World initiative. The
platform provides consumers with personal benefits
while giving them the opportunity to help prioritize the
additional health and healthcare causes that Philips will
support through the Philips Foundation in 2018.
On the occasion of United Nations General Assembly in
September 2017, we co-organized a panel discussion
on Universal Health Coverage (UHC) with the
Rockefeller Foundation and DEVEX. UHC is the number
one priority for the World Health Organization. Philips
believes the private sector can work in partnership to
develop innovative business models and provide

access to quality universal healthcare. Ronald de Jong,
Head of HR Royal Philips and Chairman of the Philips
Foundation, together with Peter Maurer, President
International Committee of the Red Cross discussed
how the Private/Public Sector can support
humanitarian causes such as healthcare, sharing our
collaboration in the development of the High Risk
Pregnancy Toolkit and the Primary Healthcare Facilities
in the Ivory Coast.
Strengthening primary care and enabling community
development
Philips continued on its journey towards improving
access to care in developing countries, especially
Africa. We have extended our pledge to improve the
lives of 300 million people a year in underserved
healthcare communities by 2025, with a specific focus
on women and children. The needs of women and
children are critical and at the heart of the need to
achieve Universal Health Coverage.
The modular Community Life Center (CLC) solution for
radical improvement of primary care was further
optimized and prepared for large scale deployment. In
the course of 2017, CLCs were inaugurated in Kenya,
South Africa and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Philips was the first private sector company to provide
support to the SDG 3 window of the newly created SDG
Partnership Platform Kenya, an initiative of the UN, the
Government of Kenya and the private sector. The SDG
3 window of the platform aims to ‘Demonstrate the
power of public-private collaboration to transform
primary healthcare, and attain Universal Health
Coverage by 2021, in support of the broader attainment
of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),
improving health & well-being of 46 million Kenyans’.
Through co-creations with county governments, Philips
will engage in large scale public private partnerships for
improving primary care.
Grand Challenges Canada on childhood pneumonia
Philips and Grand Challenges Canada (GCC) are
collaborating on an innovative project to aid and
improve the diagnosis of childhood pneumonia in low
resource settings.
Royal Philips received a repayable grant to scale the
manufacturing and distribution of the Philips Children’s
Automated Respiration Monitor (also known as
ChARM) to make it affordable and accessible for
community-based health workers in low-resource
settings throughout the world.
The ChARM has been included in the UNICEF Supply
Chain Division’s ARIDA project, for trials in Nepal and
Ethiopia. ChARM has the potential to assist community
health workers in establishing a more accurate
measurement of a sick child’s breathing rate to help
improve the diagnosis of pneumonia and potentially
prevent some of the 922,000 childhood deaths caused
by pneumonia each year.

Global Financing Facility
In 2017 Philips was elected to represent the private
sector in the Global Financing Facility (GFF) Investors
Group. The GFF is seizing the opportunity to change the
course of financing for the Sustainable Development
Goals and improve the lives of millions of women,
children, and adolescents across the world. By creating
the right financial and technical conditions for
innovation as a common objective, we believe our
involvement will achieve greater impact and better
health outcomes through collaboration.

13.3.9 Supplier indicators
Philips has a direct business relationship with
approximately 4,600 product and component
suppliers and 18,000 service providers, and in many
cases the sustainability issues deeper in our supply
chain require us to intervene beyond tier 1 of the chain.
Supplier sustainability strategy
Through a structured annual strategic process
combined with a multi-stakeholder dialogue we
identified our five key focus areas as described below:
1. Supplier Sustainability Compliance
Two core policy documents form the basis of supplier
sustainability compliance: the Supplier Sustainability
Declaration (SSD) and the Regulated Substances List
(RSL).
Supplier Sustainability Declaration (SSD)
The SSD sets out the standards and behaviors Philips
requires from its suppliers. The SSD is based on the
Responsible Business Alliance (RBA, formerly known as
Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC)) Code
of Conduct and covers the topics Health & Safety,
Labor, Environment, Ethics and Management systems.
Regulated Substances List (RSL)
The RSL specifies which chemical substances are
regulated by legislation. Suppliers are required to
follow all the requirements stated in the RSL.
Substances can either be marked as restricted or
declarable.

Feedback

Philips further specifies contractual and transparency
requirements. All suppliers are obliged to contractually
commit to the SSD and RSL. Through integration of a
Sustainability Agreement (SA) in our General Purchase
Agreement (GPA) suppliers declare compliance to both
the SSD and RSL. Upon request they also provide
additional information and evidence.
2. Supplier Sustainability Performance (SSP) “Beyond Audit”
Philips started to conduct supplier sustainability audits
in 2004 as part of its commitment to be a responsible
company. Supplier scoping was based on risk criteria
such as risk countries (Maplecroft/Veririsk) and spend
threshold (more than EUR 1 million). Since 2004, we
conducted, through third party service providers,
approximately 2,500 sustainability audits. The number
of audits and the key “non conformities” have been
published by Philips in its Annual Report from the
beginning. During the execution of the audit program
we identified industry specific non conformities
occurring at a large number of our suppliers in scope
related to for example Health and Safety or
remuneration and benefits. As a first kind of corrective
action, we have started to implement training programs
like electrical safety training, Health & Safety training
and dust explosion training. At a later stage we
participated in a capacity building program on
improving the worker-management dialogue (IDHWMD program). The outcome of these training and
capacity building programs only showed limited
positive impact on the number of non-conformities
identified.
We believed in the need for a structural change that
goes beyond audit. Therefore we designed and
developed a new approach – Supplier Sustainability
Performance (“Beyond Audit”), focusing on:
• making our supply chain sustainable in every sense
of the word
• taking a systematic approach to improving the
sustainability of our supply chain
• driving continuous improvement and measuring
impact through a structural phased approach

All aspects are related to a set of boundary conditions
that need to be met by potential suppliers before being
allowed to enter the Philips supply base.
Managing improvements structurally over time requires
a systemic approach, using a set of recognized and
global references, an executable process, specific
customized agreed actions, a set of KPIs, ambitious
targets and of course a group of suppliers that will be
in scope. This systemic approach is shown in the figure
below which is a simplified high-level representation of
the overall SSP program.

The Frame of Reference addresses two completely
different dimensions, which outline predefined
requirements and subjects that can be used to identify
the maturity level of a supplier. The core of the Frame
of Reference (see diagram below) refers to aspects as
defined in the Philips Sustainability Agreement based
on a cross-industry code of conduct, and includes for
example Health and Safety.
The outer loop in this Frame of Reference sets clear
directions for identifying and measuring the maturity
level across nine elements of the topics mentioned in
the core. Combining both dimensions into a matrix
makes it possible to identify each core aspect’s maturity
level. This matrix, capturing the summarized
information, enables mapping and monitoring of the
sustainability maturity level of individual suppliers over
time.
For each supplier within the scope of our approach, the
core elements as described in the Frame of Reference
will be identified and measured in an annual cycle
through a structured process based on four key stages

(see below). The first stage, ‘Select’, defines which
suppliers will be in scope and clarifies expectations to
all relevant stakeholders through an annual process.
The second stage, ‘Identify’, invites suppliers in scope
to complete a Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ)
and provide sufficient supporting evidence enabling
subject matter experts to perform a validation based on
predefined criteria. The third stage, ‘Agree’, assigns the
suppliers to different supplier statuses. The minimum
requirement to be met is defined as PZT (Potential Zero
Tolerance). The fourth stage is about the ‘Implement/
Sustain’ of the agreed Supplier Sustainability
Improvement Plan (SSIP). Suppliers allocate resources,
maintain the improvement plan, track the progress of
the plan, and measure how their actions are influencing
the local situation.
Supplier classification
Four different categories are used for assigning
suppliers in scope after validation of the SAQ. These
four categories are BiC (Best in Class), SSIP (Supplier
Sustainability Improvement Plan), DIY (Do It Yourself)
and No Zero Tolerance. The status of PZT (Potential
Zero Tolerance) is supposed to be a temporary status
and requires immediate attention and action.
Depending on the supplier assignment, suppliers will
be engaged in different ways to improve their
sustainability performance.

SSIP – Supplier

- Supported and trained
- Collaborates to improve

Note: no specific focus on any kind of ‘risk’ countries

If during the execution of the SSP program at any
specific period in time a (Potential) Zero Tolerance has
been identified, immediate and further action will be
taken. If the requested additional information and
evidence lead to the conclusion that there is no
structural Zero Tolerance the supplier status will be
changed and the supplier will go back to the original
track in the program. If the conclusion gives rise to a
structural Zero Tolerance the supplier will be required
to:
• Propose a plan to mitigate and/or resolve the
identified Zero Tolerance(s)
• Commit to structurally resolving the Zero Tolerance
• Provide regular updates and evidence
• Avoid quick-fixing

information

During the execution of the SSP program we have
identified several Zero Tolerances so far. Based on
these first results we can therefore conclude that
through our structural approach, our open
communication, our focus on collaboration and
suppliers showing commitment to continuous
improvement we increased transparency and mitigated
these Zero Tolerances in a structural manner.
Philips has defined six Zero Tolerances (ZT), which are:
•
•
•
•

Fake or falsified records (structural)
Child and/or forced labor (structural)
Immediate threat to the environment
Immediate threat to workers (Health and Safety
issues)
• Failure to comply with regulatory and/or Philips
requirements
• Workers’ monthly income (covering salary for regular
hours and overtime, tax deductions, social insurance)
structurally failing to meet regulatory requirements
In 2017, unfortunately one supplier decided, after
accepting the Zero Tolerance mitigation plan, to stop
execution of the plan. This triggered the phase-out
process of this specific supplier. The decision to phaseout a supplier is conducted in close collaboration with
responsible business owners, legal representatives and
sustainability subject matter experts.
Measuring impact
The impact of improvements, is measured as a single
number based on a scale varying from 0 to 100%. This
single value is calculated at individual suppliers,
combining the values of the nine elements per aspect
into one overall number. The ultimate goal is to achieve

a perfect score. However, the main focus at this
moment is to identify improvement based on the
agreed improvement plan.
More information on the Supplier Sustainability
Performance program can be found here .
Electronics have been audited by several
“PICustomers
(e.g. RBA members) for more than 10
years. Through participation in the SSP approach,
we have re-organized the company’s management
system, implemented control measures for timely
comparison and tracking improvements in a
monthly KPI report. All relevant departments are
engaged and take action to address potential areas
of improvement.

”

PI Electronics
Current sample of suppliers that entered in 2016 and
are still active in 2017 in the program is 49 (2016) and
164 (2017). All of these are validated:
• All suppliers in scope completed the SAQ and have
been validated in 2017; the program conducted a Site
assessment validation at 36% of these suppliers.
• 77 suppliers developed and agreed a Supplier
Sustainability Improvement Plan (SSIP).
• 64 suppliers started executing the SSIP whereas 13
suppliers (entered in 2016) continued to execute their
SSIP, while Philips provides support and monitors
progress on a regular basis.
• The average baseline score of all suppliers active in
the program is almost equal for 2016 (50 for 49
suppliers) and 2017 (51 for 164) suppliers.

Sustainability statements 13.3.9

• The average improvement against the baseline is
15%, for those 13 suppliers which entered the program
in 2016 and continued to execute the SSIP program
in 2017 through close collaboration with Philips.
• The average improvement against the baseline is 6%,
for those 36 suppliers which entered the program in
2016 and continued to manage the improvements
themselves (DIY) in 2017.
• The number of employees at suppliers participating
in the SSP program is approximately 200,000.

In 2017, a third party, Elevate, was engaged to support
Philips in the review of our approach and to conduct
supplier validations to get familiar with our SSP
approach. Next, Elevate conducted, in close
collaboration with our experts, several desktop
validations followed by four on-site assessment
validations, to be aligned and prepared to expand
suppliers in scope globally. For 2018 we continue our
roll-out in close collaboration with Elevate, targeting
together 400 suppliers.

SSP mainly focuses on long-term sustainability
“improvement
with a structural systematic approach.

Philips Supplier Sustainability Performance
“The
program is an innovative beyond auditing model

We have recognized three key aspects so far; 1. a
change of mindset: we as supplier can actively work
together with Philips to eliminate the risk without
the concern of being punished when the issues are
not closed, 2. a change of method: joint-effort
approach, 3. a change in effectiveness: enhance
supplier long-term competency.

that has proven to have greater impact for factories,
workers and the planet. After years of social
compliance auditing with limited impact, industry
can learn from Philips and companies should
experiment with similar efforts to drive greater
transparency, partnership and performance.

3. Responsible Sourcing of Minerals
The supply chains of minerals are long and complex.
There are typically 7+ tiers between the end-user
companies like Philips and the mines where the
minerals are being extracted. Philips does not directly
source minerals from mines in the conflict-affected and
high-risk regions. Mining in these regions often takes
place in an artisanal form, which often means it is
informal and unregulated. Artisanal miners can become
victims to exploitation by various militia and armed
groups or local traders. This increases the risk of human

rights violations (forced labor, child labor or widespread
sexual violence), unsafe working conditions or
environmental concerns.
Philips addresses the complexities of the minerals
supply chains through a continuous due diligence
process combined with multi-stakeholder initiatives for
responsible sourcing of minerals.
Responsible sourcing approach of Philips
Conflict minerals due diligence
Philips annually investigates its supply chain to identify
smelters of tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold in its supply
chain and we have committed not to purchase raw
materials, subassemblies, or supplies which are found
to contain conflict minerals.
Philips applies collective cross-industry leverage
through active engagement via the Responsible
Minerals Initiative (RMI, formerly known as the Conflict
Free Sourcing Initiative (CFSI)). The RMI identifies
smelters that can demonstrate through an independent
third-party audit that the minerals they procure are
conflict free. Philips is actively directing its supply chain
towards these smelters. See
www.responsiblemineralsinitiative.org for more details.

Tin mining in Indonesia (TWG)
Indonesia produces roughly one-third of the world’s tin
supply, of which the vast majority comes from the
islands Bangka and Belitung. The current phase
(2017-2019) of the TWG is led by the RBA Responsible
Minerals Initiative. Additional funding was received
from the EPRM to support pilot project activities for
land reclamation as well as Occupational Health and
Safety (OHS) capacity building.
IRBC Agreement Responsible Gold
In June 2017 Royal Philips signed the Agreement
Responsible Gold and as such agreed to work on
improving international responsible business conduct
across the entire gold value chain. Transparency is an
important part of these efforts, which are being
undertaken by a broad coalition of partners
(government, jewelers, recycling firms, smelting firms,
NGOs and goldsmiths). The parties agreed to join forces
with the aim of tackling child labor in Uganda by
working closely with mining communities and
connecting more responsible gold to the supply chains
of Philips and Fairphone, Solidaridad, UNICEF and
Uganda-based NGOs and CSOs.
Mica Working Group

The Philips Conflict Minerals due diligence framework,
measures and outcomes are described in the Conflict
Minerals Report that we file annually with SEC. The
Report is audited by an independent third party and
made publicly available on Philips’ website.
Multi-stakeholder initiatives for responsible sourcing
of minerals
We believe that a multi-stakeholder collaboration in
responsible sourcing of minerals is the most viable
approach in addressing the complexities of minerals
value chains.
European Partnership for Responsible Minerals
(EPRM)
EPRM is a five-year multi-stakeholder partnership
between governments, companies, and civil society
actors working toward more sustainable minerals
supply chains. Philips became a strategic, founding
partner of EPRM in May 2016, being the first
representative of the private sector to join the
initiative. The goal of the EPRM is to create better social
and economic conditions for mine workers and local
mining communities, by increasing the number of mines
that adopt responsible mining practices in Conflict and
High Risk Areas (CAHRAs).

Annual Report 2017

Mica is mainly used as a pearlescent pigment in
coatings and cosmetics, and in the electronics sector it
is used as an electrical insulator. In 2016, Terre des
Hommes in collaboration with SOMO published a
report “Beauty and a Beast” which showed the
widespread problem in the Mica industry in Jharkhand/
Bihar (India) and gaps in the due diligence of end user
companies. Philips decided to become a member of the
Responsible Mica Initiative (RMI), a cross-sector
association that ensures close collaboration between
various stakeholders to achieve a 100% responsible
Mica supply chain over the next five years.
Next, Philips and partners Terre des Hommes, Kuncai
and local Indian NGOs received funding from the RVO
“Fund Against Child Labor” for their project which
focuses on a systemic approach to creating favorable
conditions for Mica miners, educating and empowering
them to negotiate fair prices and creating access to the
market.
Cobalt - newly added to our initiatives
Research by organizations like SOMO and Greenpeace
revealed that serious human rights violations and
environmental pollution are happening in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) as a result of
cobalt mining, including water pollution and forced
evictions. In Q4 2017 Fairphone invited Philips to
engage directly with a large Cobalt refiner which also
has mining subsidiaries in the DRC. The aim was to
identify Artisanal and Small-scale Mining (ASM) cobalt
mine sites in the DRC that are able to meet the

Sustainability statements 13.3.9

developed entry-level criteria and are committed to
cooperate on improvements in the areas of Health and
Safety, fairer income, and mining impacts on
communities.
The entry-level criteria include legality, traceability and
controls including on child labor. Furthermore, it has
been agreed by Philips, Fairphone, a shared battery
supplier, a cobalt refiner and UNICEF to develop and
implement in 2018 a partnership agreement. This
partnership agreement enables structural
improvement of the situation through a well managed
multi-stakeholder initiative.
4. Circular Procurement
Philips’ ambition is to increase its circular value
proposition and it has set a 2020 target of 15% circular
revenues. Procurement can play a leading role in
Philips’ transition towards a circular economy in order
to achieve the 2020 target or even exceed this. Topics
where Procurement is actively involved are:
• Circular procurement in the procurement policy. The
next step is to define a circular procurement strategy
and a clear long-term ambition.
• The implementation of a governance structure
beyond the procurement organization to cover the
whole value chain is part of the internal Circular
Economy Excellence network.
• Execution of an analysis of internal and external
circular service models to improve collaboration.
For more information on the Circular Economy, please
refer to sub-section 13.4.1, Circular Economy, of this
Annual Report.
5. Environmental Footprint China
In order to minimize our impact, we are supporting our
Chinese suppliers to reduce their environmental
footprint and at the same time to contribute to Philips’
sustainability strategy.
Achievements in 2017
• Environmental footprint training for 148 suppliers by
Philips Supplier Sustainability team
• Via SA on-site assessment, a number of suppliers
have established new waste water and waste air
treatment facilities to ensure waste water and air
discharging in accordance with regulatory
requirements
• Monitor 2nd tier suppliers’ environmental
performance via 1st tier suppliers (monthly checking
the IPE database)
• Philips was ranked the 20th among 188 brands
(ranked 25th in 2016) on the IPE list
• Environmental footprint data reported for improving
performance by more than 60 suppliers
• Energy savings via Supplier Development Program energy savings will be achieved upon
implementation of the identified improvement
actions

Improve energy efficiency and reduce CO2
emissions
Since 2015, there have been more than 30
suppliers involved in Philips energy saving projects
organized by Philips Lean experts. Via the analysis
of manufacturing process and equipment
efficiency, Philips Lean experts together with the
suppliers, have identified a number of energy
saving opportunities. The implementation of these
opportunities have led to reductions in energy
usage. In 2017 only, 2,000 tonnes of CO2 reduction
opportunities have been identified at 11 supplier
sites.
Recognition by the Shanghai local Environmental
Protection Bureau
In 2017, due to Philips’ efforts to drive Chinese
suppliers to continuously improve their
environmental performance, Philips was
recognized as one of the best companies by
Shanghai Jing’an Environmental Protection
Bureau for its great performance in supplier
environmental management.

Process Chemicals
Philips is an active member of the RBA project team on
process chemicals; for further details on the strategy
and approach of this project see the RBA position
paper. In addition to this project team we have
addressed the topic of process chemicals in the new
SSP approach and we aim to identify if and how the
manufacturing sites are managing process chemicals.

13.4 Environmental statements
This section provides additional information on (some
of) the environmental performance parameters
reported in section 3.3, Environmental performance, of
this Annual Report.

13.4.1 Circular Economy
The transition from a linear to a circular economy is
essential to create a sustainable world. A circular
economy aims to decouple economic growth from the
use of natural resources and ecosystems by using these
resources more effectively.

The circular economy program
The circular economy program at Philips ran for the fifth
year in 2017 and consists of four strategic pillars:
1.
2.
3.
4.

Connect to stakeholders outside Philips
Internal employee engagement
Create proof points and metrics
Embed circular economy in Philips processes

Philips leverages partnerships with the Ellen MacArthur
Foundation, Circle Economy Netherlands and the
World Economic Forum. For example, through the
leadership of our CEO and supported by the circular
economy program, Philips teamed up with the World

Annual Report 2017

209

Sustainability statements 13.4.1

Economic Forum to establish a public-private platform
to accelerate the circular economy, launched in Davos
in January 2017. This platform gained further
momentum throughout 2017 and supported projects
covering diverse topics such as plastics, electronics &
hardware and business models.
At Philips we see huge opportunities for businesses to
provide greater value to customers through innovative
service models, smart upgrade paths, or product takeback and remanufacturing programs specifically. That
is why Philips made a commitment in January 2018 to
fully close the loop on all large medical systems
equipment that becomes available to us by 2020, and
we will continue to expand these practices until we
have covered all professional equipment. By “closing
the loop”, we mean that we will actively pursue the
trade-in of equipment such as MRI, CT and
Cardiovascular systems and we will take full control to
ensure that all traded-in materials are repurposed in a
responsible way.

Circular Revenues
In 2017 the Circular Revenues KPI – deployed the year
before – was further embedded in the internal target
setting. The Circular Revenues percentage captures our
revenues of validated circular products, services, and
solutions, as a % of total Philips revenues. The
validation is done against the following Philips
circularity requirements which might be further refined
in the future:
1. Performance and Access-based models
Revenues from contracts that include the condition that
Philips has individual end-of-life responsibility for the
product.
2. Refurbished, Reconditioned & Remanufactured
products/systems
Revenues from selling refurbished, reconditioned or
remanufactured products/systems with re-used
components >30% by total weight of product/ system.
3. Refurbished, Reconditioned & Remanufactured
components
Revenue from harvested components that have either
been refurbished, reconditioned or remanufactured.
The harvested component must contain >30% re-used
parts or materials by total component weight. The
component can either be a stand-alone component or
part of a new product/system. The commercial value of
the component is considered irrespective of whether it
is part of a service, warranty or sale.
4. Upgrades/refurbishment on site or remote
Revenue from upgrades of existing hardware and
software either on site or remotely.
5. Products with recycled plastics content
Revenues from products with a recycled plastics
content of >25% by total weight of eligible plastics.

210

Annual Report 2017

We set the ambition that by 2020 a total of 15% of our
revenues will come from circular propositions. This is
double the rate of 7% baseline achieved in 2015. The
result for 2017 is 11%. The main contributing revenue
streams are for:
Personal Health businesses
Revenues from our B2C products that contain a large
amount of recycled plastics, such as our businesses in
coffee and domestic appliances. Revenues from
providing our home sleep and respiratory equipment in
some markets as a rental option.
Diagnosis & Treatment businesses
Our Diamond Select offer of refurbished imaging
systems for sale, upgrading of systems at customer
premises to enhance performance and extend lifetime,
repair and reuse of spare parts.
Connected Care & Health Informatics businesses
A number of Philips businesses based on subscription
models, such as for example the Philips Lifeline
business and others.

Closing material loops
In addition to tracking circular revenue, we are also
working to achieve transparency on the material flows
connected with the Philips businesses. In 2017 Philips
put a total of some 245,000 tonnes of products on the
market. This assessment is based on sales data
combined with product-specific weights. 85% of the
total product weight was delivered through our B2C
businesses in Personal Health and 15% through our B2B
businesses (Diagnosis & Treatment businesses and
Connected Care & Health Informatics businesses).
We can account for some 20,000 tonnes or
approximately 8% of those products being collected,
re-used or recycled globally in 2016. Europe has
advanced collection systems in place. In these
countries we have an average return rate of around
40-50%. National legislation is required to create the
level playing field needed to set up efficient recycling
systems beyond the EU. The main pathways and
quantities for material re-use in 2016 were:
• Trade-in and return for resale as refurbished
products and for spare parts harvesting (Diagnosis &
Treatment and Connected Care & Health Informatics)
some 2,400 tonnes, largely unchanged from 2016.
• Collective collection and recycling schemes
according to the EU Waste Electrical and Electronic
Equipment (WEEE) collection schemes. Those
products are broken down into the main material
fractions and provided to the market via our recycling
partners
• 800 tonnes from Diagnosis & Treatment and
Connected Care & Health Informatics field returns,
following the WEEE category 8 classification,
indicating a slight decrease compared to the
previous year (900 tonnes)

Sustainability statements 13.4.1

• 16,000 tonnes from Personal Health, following the
WEEE category 2 classification
On the demand side, the Personal Health businesses
have re-integrated significantly more recycled plastics
in new products than last year, closing the material loop
for some 1,850 tonnes of plastics, up from 1,440 tonnes
in 2016.

Philips recognizes the importance of healthy
ecosystems and a rich biodiversity for our company, our
employees, and society as a whole. We aim to minimize
any negative impacts and actively promote ecosystem
restoration activities.
The Philips Biodiversity policy was issued in 2014 and
progress has been made on biodiversity management,
on sites (e.g. impact measurement), on natural capital
valuation, and at management level. Most initiatives
were led by the environmental coordinators at our sites,
for example at our Best and Drachten sites in The
Netherlands, which serve as role models on the topic of
biodiversity.
After Philips participated in 2015 in the development of
the Natural Capital Protocol and volunteered as a pilot
company, we continued these activities. In 2017, we
developed our first Environmental Profit and Loss
account (EP&L), which is described in more detail in
section 3.3, Environmental performance, of this Annual
Report. As can be derived from the EP&L, the
environmental impact of the Royal Philips sites is
limited as they are not very energy-intensive and do
not emit large quantities of high-impact substances.
The impact of our supply chain however is significantly
higher than our own impact. For this reason, we used
the identified hot-spots in our supply chain as input for
our CDP Supply Chain program. More information on
that program can be found in sub-section 13.3.9,
Supplier indicators, of this Annual Report. Next, our
focus on the Circular Economy will reduce the
environmental impact of our supply chainhttps://
www.circle-economy.com/wp-content/uploads/
2018/01/pace-pledge-20180126-digital.pdf. The
impact during the use-phase of our products is most
significant though, which underlines the importance of
our continued focus on energy efficiency improvements
of our products and our lobby efforts for more
demanding industry standards, for example via COCIR.

Operational carbon footprint and energy
efficiency - 2017 details
Becoming carbon-neutral in our operations by 2020 is
one of the key targets, after already reducing our
operational carbon footprint very significantly during
the past years (33% decrease in CO2 emissions in 2017
compared to our 2007 base year). Our carbon footprint
increased by 3% compared to 2016, resulting in a total
of 847 kilotonnes CO2.

13.4.3 Sustainable Operations
Our Sustainable Operations programs relate to
improving the environmental performance of our
manufacturing facilities and focus on most contributors
to climate change, but also address water, recycling of
waste and chemical substances.

The 2017 results can be attributed to several factors:
• Accounting for 7% of the total footprint, total
CO2 emissions from manufacturing decreased by 35%
due a higher share of electricity from renewable
sources (now at 85% in our manufacturing sites).
• CO2 emissions from non-industrial operations
(offices, warehouses, etc.), representing 5% of the
total emissions, decreased this year by 48% due to
implemented energy efficiency projects and a higher
share of electricity from renewable sources.
• The total CO2 emissions related to business travel,
accounting for 16% of our carbon footprint, showed a
decrease of 15% compared to 2016, driven by a
stricter air travel policy introduced in 2017. This led to
an air travel reduction of 10%.
• Overall CO2 emissions from logistics, representing
73% of the total, increased by 23% compared to 2016,
mainly driven by a strong increase in air freight to
meet demand. We plan to introduce various
measures to drive down air freight shipments by
introducing a stricter air freight policy and by
optimizing our warehouse locations.

Carbon emissions in manufacturing
The greenhouse gas emissions of our manufacturing
operations totaled 55 kilotonnes CO2-equivalent in
2017, 35% lower than in 2016. Indirect CO2 emissions
represent 60% of the total, which decreased by 47%
due to the higher use of electricity generated from
renewable sources. Direct CO2 emissions are
comparable to the previous years. Emission from other
greenhouse gases showed a slight decrease.

CO2 emissions in 2017 were 30 kilotonnes CO2equivalent lower than in 2016. This was driven by the
increased use of electricity generated by renewable
sources in all businesses in various regions. At Personal
Health, CO2 emissions decreased due to an increase in
the use of electricity generated by renewable sources
but was partially offset by operational changes.
Diagnosis & Treatment decreased its CO2 emissions due
to an increase in use of electricity generated by
renewable sources and lower energy consumption.
Connected Care & Health Informatics decreased its
CO2 emissions due to an increase in use of electricity
generated by renewable sources and lower energy
consumption. In December 2016, the Los Mirasoles
windfarm in the US started to produce electricity. As a
result, all our US operations were powered by wind
energy in 2017, a clear step towards our ambition to
become carbon-neutral in our operations by 2020.

Hazardous substances emissions
In the ‘Healthy people, sustainable planet’ program,
new chemical reduction targets have been defined on
the most relevant categories of substances for Royal
Philips, being hazardous substance emissions as well
as VOC (Volatile Organic Compounds) emissions. As
part of the deployment of the new program, reduction
targets at our industrial sites are being agreed.

In 2017, emissions of hazardous substances increased
by 29%, mainly caused by increased usage of harmful
chemicals at a Diagnosis & Treatment businesses site
and two Personal Health businesses sites. Changed
manufacturing processes and increased production at
multiple sites also had an impact on the emissions. One
Connected Care & Health Informatics businesses site
reduced its emissions significantly.

In 2017, four environmental incidents were reported,
one at a Personal Health businesses site, and three at
two Diagnosis & Treatment businesses sites. The four
incidents were all related to leakage or minor spills,
none of which were reportable to the local authorities.
Immediate actions were taken to remediate the effect.
Two non-compliances related to waste water were
reported, one in Personal Health businesses and one in
Diagnosis & Treatment businesses. None of these
resulted in a fine.

VOC emissions increased by 10% in 2017 to 142 tonnes.
VOC emissions in the Personal Health businesses
segment (representing 65% of the total VOC emissions)
were comparable to 2016, as increased emissions due
to changes in the product mix as well as higher volumes
were mitigated by changed lacquering processes. VOC
emissions in the Diagnosis & Treatment businesses
segment increased significantly due to higher
production volumes at several sites.

13.5 Assurance report of the independent
auditor
To: The Supervisory Board and Shareholders of
Koninklijke Philips N.V.

Report on the audit of the sustainability
information 2017 included in the annual
report

Furthermore we have complied with the ‘Verordening
gedrags- en beroepsregels accountants” (VGBA, Dutch
Code of Ethics).
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
opinion.
Limitations to the scope of our audit engagement

Our Opinion
We have audited the sustainability information in the
annual report for the year 2017 of Koninklijke Philips
N.V. (the Company), based in Eindhoven, the
Netherlands.
An audit engagement is aimed at obtaining reasonable
assurance.
In our opinion, the sustainability information presents,
in all material respects, a reliable and adequate view of:
• The policy and business operations with regard to
corporate social responsibility;
• The thereto related events and achievements for the
year 2017;
in accordance with the Sustainability Reporting
Standards (option Comprehensive) of the Global
Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the applied supplemental
reporting criteria as disclosed in section 13.1 Approach
to sustainability reporting of the annual report.
The sustainability information consists of chapter 13
Sustainability statements, section 3.2 Social
performance and section 3.3 Environmental
performance of the annual report.
Basis for our opinion
We have performed our audit on the sustainability
information in accordance with Dutch law, including
Dutch Standard 3810N ‘Assurance engagements
relating to sustainability reports’, a Standard that is
based on the International Standard on Assurance
Engagements (ISAE) 3000 ‘Assurance Engagements
other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial
Information’. Our responsibilities under this standard
are further described in the section “Our responsibilities
for the audit of the sustainability information” of our
report.
We are independent of Koninklijke Philips N.V. in
accordance with the EU Regulation on specific
requirements regarding statutory audit of publicinterest entities, the “Wet toezicht
accountantsorganisaties” (Wta, Audit firms supervision
act), the ‘Verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van
accountants bij assurance-opdrachten’ (ViO, Code of
Ethics for Professional Accountants, a regulation with
respect to independence) and other relevant
independence regulations in the Netherlands.

Annual Report 2017

Unexamined prospective information
The sustainability information includes prospective
information such as ambitions, strategy, plans,
expectations and estimates. Inherently, the actual
future results are uncertain. We do not provide any
assurance on the assumptions and achievability of
prospective information in the sustainability
information.
Unaudited references to external sources
The references to external sources or websites in the
sustainability information, excluding “Methodology for
calculating Lives Improved”, “Methodology for
calculating Environmental Profit & Loss”, “GRI content
index” and “EU Directive NFI and Diversity reference
table”, are not part of the sustainability information as
audited by us. We therefore do not provide assurance
on this information.

Description of responsibilities for the
sustainability information
Responsibilities of the Board of Management and
the Supervisory Board for the sustainability
information
The Board of Management is responsible for the
preparation of the sustainability information in
accordance with the Sustainability Reporting
Standards (option Comprehensive) of GRI and the
applied supplemental reporting criteria as disclosed in
section 13.1 Approach to sustainability reporting of the
annual report, including the identification of
stakeholders and the definition of material matters. The
choices made by the Board of Management regarding
the scope of the sustainability information and the
reporting policy are summarized in section 13.1
Approach to sustainability reporting of the annual
report.
The Board of Management is also responsible for such
internal control as the Board of Management
determines is necessary to enable the preparation of
the sustainability information that is free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or errors.
The Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the
Company’s reporting process.

Sustainability statements 13.5

Our responsibilities for the audit of the Sustainability
Information
Our responsibility is to plan and perform the assurance
engagement with a reasonable level of assurance in a
manner that allows us to obtain sufficient and
appropriate audit evidence for our opinion.
Our audit has been performed with a high, but not
absolute, level of assurance, which means we may not
have detected all material errors and fraud.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate,
they could reasonably be expected to influence the
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the
sustainability information. The materiality affects the
nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and
the evaluation of the effect of identified misstatements
on our opinion.
We apply the ‘Nadere voorschriften
kwaliteitssystemen’ (Regulations for Quality
management systems) and accordingly maintain a
comprehensive system of quality control including
documented policies and procedures regarding
compliance with ethical requirements, professional
standards and other applicable legal and regulatory
requirements.
We have exercised professional judgment and have
maintained professional skepticism throughout the
audit performed by a multi-disciplinary team, in
accordance with the Dutch Standard 3810N, ethical
requirements and independence requirements. Our
audit included e.g.:
• Performing an analysis of the external environment
and obtaining an understanding of relevant social
themes and issues, and the characteristics of the
organization
• Evaluating the appropriateness of the reporting
criteria used, their consistent application and related
disclosures, including the evaluation of the results of
the stakeholders’ dialogue and the reasonableness
of estimates made for Lives Improved and the
Environmental Profit & Loss by management
• Obtaining an understanding of the systems and
processes for collecting, reporting and consolidating
sustainability information, including obtaining an
understanding of internal control relevant to our
audit
• Reconciling the relevant financial information with
the financial statements
• Identifying and assessing the risks of material
misstatement of the sustainability information,
whether due to errors or fraud, designing and
performing further audit procedures responsive to
those risks, and obtaining audit evidence that is
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
opinion. The risk of not detecting a material
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for
one resulting from errors, as fraud may involve

collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,
misrepresentations, or the override of internal
control. These further procedures consisted amongst
others of:
• Interviewing management and relevant staff at
corporate and business unit level responsible for
the sustainability strategy, policy and results;
• Interviewing relevant staff responsible for:
• providing the information
• carrying out internal control procedures on, and
• consolidating the data in the sustainability
information
• Visits to production sites in China (Zhuhai and
Respironics Shenzen) and Costa Rica (Coyol)
aimed at, on a local level, validating source data
and to evaluate the design, implementation and
operation of control validation procedures
• Evaluating relevant internal and external
documentation, on a test basis, to determine the
reliability of the information in the sustainability
information
• An analytical review of the data and trends
submitted for consolidation at corporate level
• Evaluating the presentation, structure and content
of the sustainability information as a whole,
including the disclosures, in relation to the
reporting criteria used
We communicate with the Supervisory Board
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and
timing of the audit and significant findings, including
any significant findings in internal control that we
identify during our audit.

Dividend policy
Philips’ dividend policy is aimed at dividend stability
and a pay-out ratio of 40% to 50% of continuing net
income after adjustments.
Net income after adjustments is the base figure used to
calculate the dividend pay-out for the year. For 2017,
the key exclusions to arrive at net income after
adjustments are the following: charges related to
quality and regulatory actions, charges related to the
separation of the Lighting business, charges related to
the CRT litigation provision in the US, charges related to
portfolio rationalization measures, charges related to
the consent decree focused on the defibrillator
manufacturing in the US, net gain from the sale of real
estate assets, received dividend income, tax charges
related to the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and results that

Shareholders will be given the opportunity to make
their choice between cash and shares between May 9,
2018 and June 1, 2018. If no choice is made during this
election period the dividend will be paid in cash. On
June 1, 2018 after close of trading, the number of share
dividend rights entitled to one new common share will
be determined based on the volume-weighted average
price of all traded common shares of Koninklijke Philips
N.V. at Euronext Amsterdam on May 30 and 31, and
June 1, 2018. The company will calculate the number of
share dividend rights entitled to one new common
share (the ratio), such that the gross dividend in shares
will be approximately equal to the gross dividend in
cash. The ratio and the number of shares to be issued
will be announced on June 5, 2018. Payment of the
dividend and delivery of new common shares, with
settlement of fractions in cash, if required, will take
place from June 6, 2018. The distribution of dividend in
cash to holders of New York Registry shares will be
made in USD at the USD/EUR rate as per WM/ Reuters
FX Benchmark 2 PM CET fixing of June 4, 2018.
Further details will be given in the agenda for the 2018
Annual General Meeting of Shareholders. All dates
mentioned remain provisional until then.
Dividend in cash is in principle subject to 15% Dutch
dividend withholding tax, which will be deducted from
the dividend in cash paid to the shareholders. Dividend
in shares paid out of net income and retained earnings
is subject to 15% dividend withholding tax, but only in
respect of the par value of the shares (EUR 0.20 per
share). Shareholders are advised to consult their tax
advisor on the applicable situation with respect to taxes
on the dividend received.

Share capital structure
During 2017, Philips’ issued share capital increased by
approximately 11 million common shares to
approximately 941 million common shares as a result of
the issuance of 11.3 million shares as elected stock
dividend. As per 31 December 2017, approximately 14.7
million of the common shares issued are held by Philips
as treasury shares. Out of these treasury shares,
approximately 10.1 million are held to cover long-term
incentive and employee stock purchase plans and
approximately 4.6 million result from share
repurchases made for capital reduction purposes (see
below under ‘Share repurchases’). The number of
issued shares and outstanding as per December 31,
2017 was 926 million, up from 922 million at December
31, 2016.
The Dutch Act on Financial Supervision imposes an
obligation on persons holding certain interests to
disclose (inter alia) percentage holdings in the capital
and/or voting rights in the Company when such
holdings reach, exceed or fall below 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25,
30, 40, 50, 60, 75 and 95 percent (as a result of an
acquisition or disposal by a person, or as a result of a
change in the company’s total number of voting rights
or capital issued). Certain derivatives (settled in kind or
in cash) are also taken into account when calculating
the capital interest. The statutory obligation to disclose
capital interest does not only relate to gross long
positions, but also to gross short positions. Required
disclosures must be made to the Netherlands Authority
for the Financial Markets (AFM) without delay. The AFM
then notifies the Company of such disclosures and
includes them in a register which is published on the

Share repurchases
Share repurchases for capital reduction purposes
On June 28, 2017, Philips announced a EUR 1.5 billion
share buyback program for capital reduction purposes,
within the limits of relevant laws and regulations (in
particular EC Regulation 2273/2003) and Philips’
articles of association. All shares acquired under this
program are held as treasury shares until they are
cancelled. Philips started the purchases under this
program in the third quarter of 2017 and intends to
complete the program in two years. The program is
being executed by means of forward contracts with

Investor Relations 15.2

In 2017, Philips acquired a total of 15.2 million shares for
LTI coverage. Philips repurchased 5.0 million shares in
the open market. A further 10.2 million shares were
acquired under certain over-the-counter derivatives
purchased in 2016 and 2017. During 2018, Philips may
continue with additional repurchases, the size of which
will depend on the movement of the Philips share price.

financial institutions, as well as in the open market via
intermediary to allow for buybacks during both open
and closed periods.
In 2017, Philips entered into a number of forward
contracts, for future delivery and settlement of
approximately 31 million shares (in Q4 2018 and Q2
2019). Furthermore, Philips repurchased approximately
4.6 million of common shares in the open market.

As of December 31, 2017, Philips still held 6.3 million
options as a hedge of 6.8 million remaining employee
options (granted until 2013), which will automatically be
exercised upon the exercise of such employee options.

By the end of 2017, Philips had completed 77% of the
EUR 1.5 billion share repurchase program.
Share repurchases related to Long-Term Incentive
(LTI) and employee stock purchase programs
To cover outstanding obligations resulting from past
and present long-term incentive (LTI) programs, Philips
repurchases Philips shares from time to time, within the
limits of relevant laws and regulations (in particular EC
Regulation 2273/2003) and Philips’ articles of
association. The shares acquired to cover such LTI
positions may be held by Philips as treasury shares until
these are distributed to participants. In order to acquire
shares for LTI programs, Philips may repurchase shares
under a discretionary management agreement with
one or more intermediaries to allow for buybacks in the
open market during both open and closed periods.
Philips may also repurchase shares through alternative
transactions, such as over-the-counter derivatives
purchased from financial institutions.

A total of 10.4 million shares were held in treasury by
the Company on December 31, 2017 (2016: 7.2 million
shares) for coverage of LTI plans. As of that date, a total
of 20.8 million rights under LTI plans were outstanding
(2016: 33.5 million shares).
Further details on the share repurchase programs can
be found on the Investor Relations website. For more
information see chapter 10, Corporate governance, of
this Annual Report.

policy, Philips is committed to a strong investment
grade credit rating. There is no assurance that Philips
will be able to achieve this goal. Ratings are subject to
change at any time. Adverse changes in the Company’s
ratings will not trigger automatic withdrawal of
committed credit facilities nor any acceleration in the
outstanding long-term debt (provided that the USDdenominated bonds contain a ‘Change of Control
Triggering Event’ and the EUR-denominated bonds
contain a ‘Change of Control Put Event’, as both
described in more detail in note 18, Debt).

Shareholders
The Agenda and the explanatory notes to the Agenda
for the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on May

Investor Relations activities
From time to time the Company communicates with
investors via road shows, broker conferences and a
Capital Markets Day, announced in advance on the
Company’s website. The purpose of these
engagements is to inform the market of the results,
strategy and decisions made, as well as to receive
feedback from shareholders. Furthermore, the
Company engages in bilateral communications with
investors. These take place either at the initiative of the
Company or at the initiative of investors. The Company
is generally represented by its Investor Relations
department during these interactions, however, on a
limited number of occasions the Investor Relations
department is accompanied by one or more members
of the senior management. The subject matter of the
bilateral communications ranges from individual
queries from investors to more elaborate discussions
following disclosures that the Company has made, such
as its annual and quarterly reports. Also here, the
Company is strict in its compliance with applicable rules
and regulations on fair and non-selective disclosure
and equal treatment of shareholders.

Definitions and abbreviations 16

16 Definitions and abbreviations
Brominated flame retardants (BFR)
Brominated flame retardants are a group of chemicals that have an
inhibitory effect on the ignition of combustible organic materials. Of the
commercialized chemical flame retardants, the brominated variety are
most widely used.
CO2-equivalent
CO2-equivalent or carbon dioxide equivalent is a quantity that describes,
for a given mixture and amount of greenhouse gas, the amount of CO2 that
would have the same global warming potential (GWP), when measured
over a specified timescale (generally 100 years).
Circular economy
A circular economy aims to decouple economic growth from the use of
natural resources and ecosystems by using those resources more
effectively. By definition it is a driver for innovation in the areas of
material-, component- and product reuse, as well as new business
models such as solutions and services. In a Circular Economy, the more
effective use of materials enables to create more value, both by cost
savings and by developing new markets or growing existing ones.
Dividend yield
The dividend yield is the annual dividend payment divided by Philips’
market capitalization. All references to dividend yield are as of December
31 of the previous year.
Employee Engagement Index (EEI)
The Employee Engagement Index (EEI) is the single measure of the overall
level of employee engagement at Philips. It is a combination of
perceptions and attitudes related to employee satisfaction, commitment
and advocacy.
Energy-using Products (EuP)
An energy-using product is a product that uses, generates, transfers or
measures energy (electricity, gas, fossil fuel). Examples include boilers,
computers, televisions, transformers, industrial fans and industrial
furnaces.
Full-time equivalent employee (FTE)
Full-time equivalent is a way to measure a worker’s involvement in a
project. An FTE of 1.0 means that the person is equivalent to a full-time
worker, while an FTE of 0.5 signals that the worker works half-time.
Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)
The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) is a network-based organization that
pioneered the world’s most widely used sustainability reporting
framework. GRI is committed to the framework’s continuous improvement
and application worldwide. GRI’s core goals include the mainstreaming of
disclosure on environmental, social and governance performance.
Green Innovation
Green Innovation comprise all R&D activities directly contributing to the
development of Green Products or Green Technologies.
Green Products
Green Products offer a significant environmental improvement in one or
more Green Focal Areas: Energy efficiency, Packaging, Hazardous
substances, Weight, Recycling and disposal and Lifetime reliability. The
life cycle approach is used to determine a product’s overall environmental
improvement. It calculates the environmental impact of a product over its
total life cycle (raw materials, manufacturing, product use and disposal).
Green Products need to prove leadership in at least one Green Focal Area
compared to industry standards, which is defined by a sector specific peer
group. This is done either by outperforming reference products (which can
be a competitor or predecessor product in the particular product family)
by at least 10%, outperforming product specific eco-requirements or by
being awarded with a recognized eco-performance label. Because of
different product portfolios, sectors have specified additional criteria for
Green Products, including product specific minimum requirements where
relevant.

228

Annual Report 2017

Green Revenues
Green Revenues are generated through products and solutions which
offer a significant environmental improvement in one or more of the green
focal areas of energy efficiency, packaging, hazardous substances, weight,
circularity, and lifetime reliability. Green Revenues are determined by
classifying the environmental impact of the product or solution over its
total life cycle.
Philips uses Green Revenues as a measure of social and economic
performance in addition to its environmental results. The use of this
measure may be subject to limitations as it does not have a standardized
meaning and similar measures could be determined differently by other
companies.
Growth geographies
Growth geographies are the developing geographies comprising of Asia
Pacific (excluding Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand), Latin
America, Central & Eastern Europe, the Middle East (excluding Israel) and
Africa.
Hazardous substances
Hazardous substances are generally defined as
substances posing imminent and substantial danger to public health and
welfare or the environment.
Income from operations (EBIT)
Income from operations as reported on the IFRS consolidated statement
of income. The term EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) has the same
meaning as income from operations.
Income from continuing operations
Income from continuing operations as reported on the IFRS consolidated
statement of income, which is net income from continuing operations, or
net income excluding discontinued operations
Initiatief Duurzame Handel (IDH)
IDH is the Dutch Sustainable Trade Initiative. It brings together
government, frontrunner companies, civil society organizations and labor
unions to accelerate and up-scale sustainable trade in mainstream
commodity markets from the emerging countries to Western Europe.
International Standardization Organization (ISO)
The International Standardization Organization (ISO) is the world’s largest
developer and publisher of International Standards. ISO is a network of
the national standards institutes of more than 160 countries, one member
per country, with a Central Secretariat in Geneva, Switzerland, that
coordinates the system. ISO is a non-governmental organization that
forms a bridge between the public and private sectors.
Lives improved by Philips
To calculate how many lives we are improving, market intelligence and
statistical data on the number of people touched by the products
contributing to the social or ecological dimension over the lifetime of a
product are multiplied by the number of those products delivered in a
year. After elimination of double counts – multiple different product
touches per individual are only counted once – the number of lives
improved by our innovative solutions is calculated. We established our
2012 baseline at 1.6 billion a year.
Mature geographies
Mature geographies are the highly developed markets comprising of
Western Europe, North America, Japan, South Korea, Israel, Australia and
New Zealand.
Non-Governmental Organization (NGO)
A non-governmental organization (NGO) is any non-profit, voluntary
citizens’ group which is organized at a local, national or international level.
Operational carbon footprint
A carbon footprint is the total set of greenhouse gas emissions caused by
an organization, event, product or person; usually expressed in kilotonnes
CO2-equivalent. The Philips operational carbon footprint is calculated on
a half-year basis and includes industrial sites (manufacturing and
assembly sites), non-industrial sites (offices, warehouses, IT centers and
R&D facilities), business travel (lease and rental cars and airplane travel)
and logistics (air, sea and road transport).

Definitions and abbreviations 16

Polyvinyl chloride (PVC)
Polyvinyl chloride, better known as PVC or vinyl, is an inexpensive plastic
so versatile it has become completely pervasive in modern society. The
list of products made from polyvinyl chloride is exhaustive, ranging from
phonograph records to drainage and potable piping, water bottles, cling
film, credit cards and toys. More uses include window frames, rain gutters,
wall paneling, doors, wallpapers, flooring, garden furniture, binders and
even pens.
REACH
Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals
(REACH) is a European Union regulation dated 18 December 2006. REACH

certain specific applications, in concentrations greater than the values
decided by the European Commission. These values have been
established as 0.01% by weight per homogeneous material for cadmium
and 0.1% for the other five substances.
Sustainable Innovation
Sustainable Innovation is the Research & Development spend related to
the development of new generations of products and solutions that
address the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 3 (“to ensure
healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages”) or 12 (“to ensure
sustainable consumption and production patterns”). This includes all
Diagnosis & Treatment and Connected Care & Health Informatics
innovation spend. Next, innovation spend that contributes to Green
Products and healthy living at Personal Health is included. Finally,
innovation spend at HealthTech Other is included that addresses the
SDGs 3 and 12.
Sustainable Revenues
Sustainable Revenues are revenues generated through products and
solutions that address the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals
3 (“to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages”) or
12 (“to ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns”) and
include all Diagnosis & Treatment and Connected Care & Health
Informatics revenues. Next, Green Revenues and non-Green revenues
that contribute to healthy living at Personal Health are included.
Sustainable Development Goals
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a collection of 17 global

each has its own targets to achieve. The SDGs cover a broad range of social
and economic development issues. These include poverty, hunger, health,
education, climate change, water, sanitation, energy, environment and
social justice.
VOC
Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are organic chemicals that have a high
vapor pressure at ordinary room temperature. Their high vapor pressure
results from a low boiling point, which causes large numbers of molecules
to evaporate or sublimate from the liquid or solid form of the compound
and enter the surrounding air, a trait known as volatility.
Voluntary turnover
Voluntary turnover covers all employees who resigned of their own
volition.
Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE)
The Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE Directive)
is the European Community directive on waste electrical and electronic
equipment which became European Law in February 2003, setting
collection, recycling and recovery targets for all types of electrical goods.
The directive imposes the responsibility for the disposal of waste electrical
and electronic equipment on the manufacturers of such equipment.

statutory tax rate, which is a weighted average of all applicable
jurisdictions. This weighted average statutory tax rate (WASTR) is the
aggregation of the result before tax multiplied by the applicable statutory
tax rate without adjustment for losses, divided by the group result before
tax.

Forward-looking statements and other information 17

17 Forward-looking statements
and other information
Forward-looking statements
This document contains certain forward-looking
statements with respect to the financial condition,
results of operations and business of Philips and certain
of the plans and objectives of Philips with respect to
these items. Examples of forward-looking statements
include statements made about our strategy, estimates
of sales growth, future Adjusted EBITA and future
developments in our business. Forward-looking
statements can be identified generally as those
containing words such as “anticipates”, “assumes”,
“believes”, “estimates”, “expects”, “should”, “will”, “will
likely result”, “forecast”, “outlook”, “projects”, “may” or
similar expressions. By their nature, forward-looking
statements involve risk and uncertainty because they
relate to future events and circumstances and there are
many factors that could cause actual results and
developments to differ materially from those expressed
or implied by these forward-looking statements.
These factors include, but are not limited to, domestic
and global economic and business conditions,
developments within the euro zone, the successful
implementation of our strategy and our ability to realize
the benefits of this strategy, our ability to develop and
market new products, changes in legislation, legal
claims, changes in exchange and interest rates and
regulations, changes in tax rates, pension costs and
actuarial assumptions, raw materials and employee
costs, our ability to identify and complete successful
acquisitions and to integrate those acquisitions into our
business, our ability to successfully exit certain
businesses or restructure our operations, the rate of
technological changes, cyber-attacks, breaches of
sybersecurity political, economic and other
developments in countries where Philips operates,
industry consolidation and competition, and the state
of international capital markets as they may affect the
timing and nature of the dispositions by Philips of its
remianing interests in Philips Lighting.
As a result, Philips’ actual future results may differ
materially from the plans, goals and expectations set
forth in such forward-looking statements. For a
discussion of factors that could cause future results to
differ from such forward-looking statements, see also
chapter 6, Risk management, of this Annual Report.
Third-party market share data
Statements regarding market share, including those
regarding Philips’ competitive position, contained in
this document, are based on outside sources such as
research institutes, industry and dealer panels in
combination with management estimates. Where

230

Annual Report 2017

information is not yet available to Philips, those
statements may also be based on estimates and
projections prepared by outside sources or
management. Rankings are based on sales unless
otherwise stated.
Fair value information
In presenting the Philips Group’s financial position, fair
values are used for the measurement of various items
in accordance with the applicable accounting
standards. These fair values are based on market prices,
where available, and are obtained from sources that are
deemed to be reliable. Readers are cautioned that
these values are subject to changes over time and are
only valid at the balance sheet date. When quoted
prices or observable market values do not exist, fair
values are estimated using valuation models and
unobservable inputs, which we believe are appropriate
for their purpose. They require management to make
significant assumptions with respect to future
developments which are inherently uncertain and may
therefore deviate from actual developments. Critical
assumptions used are disclosed in the financial
statements. In certain cases, independent valuations
are obtained to support management’s determination
of fair values.
IFRS basis of presentation
The audited consolidated financial statements as of
December 31, 2017 and 2016, and for each of the years
in the three-year period ended December 31, 2017 have
been prepared in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as endorsed by
the European Union (EU). All standards and
interpretations issued by the International Accounting
Standards Board (IASB) and the IFRS Interpretations
Committee effective year-end 2017 have been
endorsed by the EU, except that the EU did not adopt
certain paragraphs of IAS 39 applicable to certain
hedge transactions. Philips has no hedge transactions
to which these paragraphs are applicable.
Consequently, the accounting policies applied by
Philips also comply with IFRS as issued by the IASB.
Use of non-IFRS information
In presenting and discussing the Philips Group’s
financial position, operating results and cash flows,
management uses certain non-IFRS financial
measures. These non-IFRS financial measures should
not be viewed in isolation as alternatives to the
equivalent IFRS measure and should be used in
conjunction with the most directly comparable IFRS
measures. Non-IFRS financial measures do not have
standardized meaning under IFRS and therefore may

Forward-looking statements and other information 17

not be comparable to similar measures presented by
other issuers. A reconciliation of these non-IFRS
measures to the most directly comparable IFRS
measures is contained in this document. Reference is
made in Reconciliation of non-IFRS information, of this
report.
Statutory financial statements and management
report
The chapters Group financial statements and Company
financial statements contain the statutory financial
statements of the Company.
The introduction to the chapter Group financial
statements sets out which parts of this Annual Report
form the management report within the meaning of
Section 2:391 of the Dutch Civil Code (and related
Decrees).
