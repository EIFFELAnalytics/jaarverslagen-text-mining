Our Better Together strategy
continued to help us to drive
advances in shopping and
delight our customers in today’s
transforming retail environment.

Pro forma net sales rose

1.7%

at constant rates
In 2017, net consumer online sales were

€2.8bn

On track to deliver close to €5 billion
in online sales by 2020

Dear reader,
Our first full year as Ahold Delhaize was one of
change, both for our company and our industry.
As we further increased focus on our great
local brands and substantially completed the
integration of our company, our Better Together
strategy continued to help us to drive advances
in shopping and delight our customers in today’s
rapidly transforming retail environment.
During the year, we introduced a new brandcentric organizational structure in our U.S.
businesses – Stop & Shop, Food Lion, Giant
Landover, Hannaford, Giant Carlisle and Peapod
– better positioning them to deepen their
connection to local communities and put the
customer at the center of all they do. On January
1, 2018, we established Ahold Delhaize USA
as the parent company for the U.S. local brands
as well as Retail Business Services (RBS), the
shared services company providing support to
these brands. We also finished integrating our
group offices while teams in the Netherlands and
Belgium made great progress on synergy savings
through negotiations with suppliers.

Financial performance

In 2017, our great local brands delivered
another strong performance, with rising sales
and expanding margins driven by synergies.
Pro forma net sales rose 1.7% at constant
exchange rates to €62.7 billion, primarily driven
by The Netherlands, Delhaize America, and
Central and Southeastern Europe. Our brands
grew market share in most of their markets.
The synergy delivery is ahead of schedule,
with €268 million net synergies realized for 2017.
I’m pleased to report that thanks to teams across
our businesses, we are able to increase the
amount of gross synergies we are committing to
deliver from €500 million to €750 million by 2019.
We will reinvest €250 million in the business.
Our full-year pro forma underlying operating
margin was 3.9%, driven by synergies, compared
to 3.7% in 2016. We delivered a strong free cash
flow of €1.9 billion and we continued to invest in our
stores and online channels, while returning excess
liquidity to shareholders. We completed a €1 billion
share buyback and launched a new €2 billion
program for 2018.
With our strong balance sheet, we are pleased
to propose a dividend of €0.63 per share,
an increase of 10.5% compared to last year’s
dividend. It represents a payout ratio of 47%
of pro forma underlying income from continuing
operations, reflecting our ambition to sustainably
grow the dividend per share.

In 2017, we sent out close
to 2.5 billion personalized
offers to our customers,
making the online and
in-store experience more
relevant and personal.

Driving changes in retail

Today, as in years past, we play a central role
in both identifying consumers’ needs and
helping to shape them. As a family of trusted
local retail brands with 150 years serving
customers, it’s something we’re very good at.
Our innovations are making shopping more
convenient, for example with a faster checkout
experience, and more personal, leveraging
digital loyalty programs targeted at individual
customer preferences. In 2017, we sent out close
to 2.5 billion personalized offers to our customers,
making the online and in-store experience more
relevant and personal.
Our efforts to expand our online businesses
resulted in €2.8 billion in net consumer online sales
in 2017, more than €1 billion of which was in food.
I’m pleased to report that we’re on track to deliver
close to €5 billion in online sales by 2020. As part
of this drive, we’re making significant investments
to further support our e-commerce growth and
build our online warehouse capacity.
We are also supporting and encouraging the
shift to healthier diets, using the power of our own
brands to offer new and exciting choices in fresh
and provide affordable organic products. And the
strength of our combined company is helping us
do all of this – and more – even better than before.

And there is more to do. The pace of change in
the retail landscape and in customers’ shopping
habits continues to gain speed, and competition
is spreading far beyond the supermarket channel
– to discounters, online players and meal-kit
providers, to name a few. Technologies like
robotics, artificial intelligence and voice ordering
are accelerating the changes taking place.
While customers remain focused on value and
convenience, they also want a personalized
shopping experience tailored to fit their busy
lives. Customers expect retailers to anticipate
their specific needs and then enable them to
shop exactly how they want – which, more than
ever, means using their mobile devices. And with
the increasing use of technology, retailers are
putting a strong focus on cyber-security and
protecting customer data.
In this atmosphere of change, there’s only
one way to thrive – by embracing, and driving,
change ourselves.

Message from our CEO
continued

A year of being better together

Since its launch, our Better Together strategy
has positioned us to drive the trends in our
markets. In 2017, all our brands continued to
innovate with the goal of providing a seamless
online and in-store experience tailored to
customers’ needs – to make shopping easier,
hassle-free and more personal.
In the Netherlands, Albert Heijn to go is
launching a checkout-free concept for stores,
where customers can tap a card on the shelf
label to purchase products without going through
a checkout line. We call it “tap to go.” Peapod,
our online grocer in the U.S., introduced a voiceenabled ordering tool. And Giant is experimenting
with robots in its stores.
Across the company, we are developing and
further enhancing our digital loyalty programs
and ability to provide personalized offers
and promotions to customers. For example,
Hannaford launched its My Hannaford Rewards
loyalty program and Food Lion enriched its
loyalty program with a digital Shop & Earn
program during the year, both offering rewards
and personalized savings to customers.
And AB Vassilopoulos in Greece made
great improvements in its existing customer
loyalty program.

We continued to invest in e-commerce and digital
solutions to let customers shop when and how they
want, and to drive sales growth. A highlight for me
came when bol.com opened a new automated
fulfillment center to facilitate growth, expand its
assortment and ensure even faster delivery to
customers. The brand already offers customers
the option to get many popular items on their
doorsteps hours after ordering.
In 2017, Albert Heijn took another step forward
in satisfying increasingly busy customers when
it started to test a new online service called
“Rappie,” that promises delivery in as little as two
hours. Our brands are also delivering more value
and convenience to customers through meal kits
that contain all of the pre-measured ingredients to
cook a nutritious meal. The customer response at
Peapod, for example, has been very positive, with
meal kits sales up over 60% in the past year and
customers giving them an average rating of more
than four out of five stars on Peapod’s website.
We are investing in unique experiences in our
supermarkets – for example at Albert, which
completely remodeled its flagship store in Prague
with an inspiring new fresh market concept that
is achieving double-digit growth. Busy customers
also look to our brands’ supermarkets to do the
cooking for them – Hannaford has been adding
Hannaford Kitchen locations that provide freshly
made, grab-and-go meal options from stir fry
and hand-battered fried chicken to signature
sandwiches. They have proved to be popular
with customers. In Romania, Mega Image
opened its first Mega Apetit convenience store,
where customers can buy ready-made meals for
immediate consumption.

This year, our Albert Heijn
Foundation, which invests in
local community initiatives for
its fruit, vegetable and flower
suppliers in Africa, celebrated
its 10th anniversary. In the past
decade, over 30,000 children
and adults in 10 African
countries have benefited from
the Foundation’s investment in
education alone and this year
we plan to expand its activities
to South America.

Our own brands are also differentiating our
businesses in the minds of today’s value-focused
customers. We are investing to optimize our ownbrand portfolios and leveraging expertise from
both sides of the Atlantic to provide healthy and
convenient choices for our customers. Albert Heijn
improved the quality of hundreds of own-brand
products during the year. We introduced our
Dutch Etos health and beauty care brand at
supermarkets across Europe following a launch
in the U.S. in 2016. In the U.S., our “free from” and
organic lines are popular with health-focused
customers, and in 2017, our U.S. brands exceeded
$1 billion in sales from these products. We are now
merging the Nature’s Promise and Nature’s Place
lines and expect the combined brand to achieve
sales of $1.5 billion by 2020.
To make all of this possible, we continue to look
for smarter and better ways of doing things
while savings from our “save for our customers”
programs are being reinvested in the businesses.

Caring for communities near and far

Sustainable retailing remains very close to our
hearts and an integral part of our Better Together
strategy. We have committed to reduce food waste
in our own operations by 20% between 2016
and 2020, and I’m pleased to report that two of
our brands – Albert Heijn and Delhaize Belgium
– already recycle 100% of food waste. One way
we reduce waste is by donating unsold food to
local food banks. Delhaize in Belgium continues
to work towards its pledge to redistribute at least
half of all unsold food to people in need by 2020 in
partnership with about 200 food banks and other
charitable associations in its communities.

Message from our CEO
continued

Hannaford and Food Lion continue to support
local food bank initiatives and donated 40,735
tonnes of food in 2017. Stop & Shop made a
$780,000 donation to 810 public and private
schools in Connecticut through its school
fundraising program.
Our brands have also launched initiatives outside
of their markets. This year, our Albert Heijn
Foundation, which invests in local community
initiatives for fruit, vegetable and flower suppliers
in Africa, celebrated its 10th anniversary. In the
past decade, over 30,000 children and adults
in 10 African countries have benefited from
the Foundation’s investment in education alone
and this year we plan to expand its activities
to South America.
I was proud that, as a result of these and other
activities, we ranked again among industry
leaders in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index
(DJSI) World list with a score of 73 in the Food
and Staples Retailing sector – well above the
industry average score of 45. You can read
more about our sustainable retailing activities
in this Annual Report, including our performance
on our 2020 targets and how we continue to work
in line with the UN Global Compact principles.
We also recognize the importance of the UN
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and
support multiple SDGs through our sustainability
efforts as part of our Better Together strategy.

A strong leadership team

Having the right leadership team in place is
important for driving our strategy. We’ve had
several leadership changes during the year that
I’d like to mention. Wouter Kolk, Brand President
of Albert Heijn, has joined our Executive Committee
as Chief Operating Officer the Netherlands and
Belgium. As of January 1, 2019, he is also
proposed to succeed our Chief Operating
Officer Europe and Indonesia, Pierre Bouchut,
who retired this year and will remain available
as an advisor and for specific initiatives until
July 1, 2018. I am pleased with Wouter’s
expanding role and grateful for the important
contributions Pierre made throughout the merger.
As part of the creation of Ahold Delhaize USA,
we appointed Kevin Holt as Chief Executive
Officer Ahold Delhaize USA. In this new role,
he remains a member of our Management
Board and Executive Committee. I’m confident
that Kevin is the right person to guide our U.S.
businesses through this time of continuous
change and evolving customer expectations.
We have also welcomed another new member
to our Executive Committee – our Global Chief
Information Officer Ben Wishart – and created
a new role, Chief Digital Officer, to be responsible
for driving digital transformation and innovation.
This new role will replace the role of Chief
eCommerce and Innovation Officer, formerly
held by Hanneke Faber, who left the company
in December. I thank Hanneke for the great
contribution she made in defining and carrying
out our digital and omni-channel growth strategy.

In April, Stephanie Shern stepped down from
our Supervisory Board, and later in the year
we announced that Jack Stahl would also step
down, due to other business commitments.
Board member René Hooft Graafland agreed
to take over his duties as Chairman of the Audit,
Finance and Risk Committee. We are grateful for
their years of service and the contributions they
made to the merger process and establishing
our new company.

Our associates are key
to our success

We rely on hundreds of thousands of dedicated
associates to be the human face of our local
brands to customers, suppliers and communities
every day. This is why our promise to become
a better place to work is so fundamental. I’m
happy to say that our latest company-wide survey
showed a strong participation rate and an overall
engagement rate among associates of 78%.
In years to come we hope to continue to build on
these good results. It is also why we feel it is so
important that the diversity of our customer base
is reflected in our own businesses. We have many
initiatives to support diversity and inclusion; one
highlight for me is the progress our Food Lion and
Hannaford brands are making, both in learning
and development opportunities for associates
and in their offerings to diverse customers.
Their good work was recognized with several
external awards in 2017.

Outlook

Looking ahead to 2018, we confirm our target of
realizing €420 million in net synergies. Free cash
flow was exceptionally strong in 2017, and we
expect it to be at a similar level in 2018 after taking
into account a cash benefit of around €200 million
resulting from the U.S. tax reforms. Our capital
expenditure is expected to increase to €1.9 billion
in 2018, focused on improving our store network,
expanding our omni-channel offering and further
developing our digital capabilities. Following tax
reforms in the U.S. and Belgium, we expect the
effective tax rate for the company to move to the
low 20% range going forward.

In closing

I would like to close by thanking associates
for their dedication to local customers across
all our brands, and for embracing change and
innovation so that we can keep getting better
together. I would also like to thank customers for
inspiring us every day. And, of course, I want to
thank our shareholders for their continued support
of our company.
All the best,
Dick Boer

Our value chain
continued

Sourcing more sustainable coffee
Coffee is one of the seven
commodities we recognize
as “critical,” which means it is
an area of focus for us in driving
more sustainable production.

Product sustainability
To drive sustainability throughout
the global value chain, Ahold
Delhaize has implemented several
performance indicators and targets
at each of the chain’s stages.
For example, we have put in place sustainable
sourcing targets for seven critical commodities
(coffee, tea, cocoa, seafood, palm oil, soy and
wood fiber). To reach these targets, we partner
with farmers, suppliers and industry groups to
drive more sustainable production.

It requires a continuous effort to map and
understand the global food supply chain so we
can assess how natural resources are used, for
instance, or how good working conditions are
monitored and ensured.
Increasing the transparency of environmental
and social impacts in our own business and
along the value chain helps us evaluate where
and how we can improve.

For a company like ours with a global spread
of suppliers, production locations and farmers,
this is an ongoing challenge – and opportunity.
One challenge we are tackling is to make it easier
for our customers to maintain healthy diets and
eat fresh foods. However, fresh products have
a shorter shelf life and can lead to more waste,
both in our own operations and in our customers’
homes. We reduce our own waste by preventing
it in the first place through inventory management
and by sharing best practices to redistribute
unsold food and we also provide advice to help
customers to prevent food waste at home.
In addition, our online sales are increasing
and these bring new environmental and social
challenges around sustainable packaging,
customer service and more environmentallyfriendly transportation. One way we are
addressing these challenges is by moving
towards cleaner, quieter and more economical
(electric) trucks in urban areas.

Today, 82% of our own-brand coffee is
certified, ensuring that the coffee our brands
buy is sourced from farmers who receive fair
pay under decent labor conditions and is
responsibly produced with modest use
of fertilizers, pesticides, water and energy.

In addition, we are working on an upcoming
project to develop drought-resistant trees in
Tanzania and provide local farmers with highquality seedlings at a lower price. We are also
proud to have joined up with the Sustainable
Coffee Challenge, which aims to make coffee
the first fully sustainable agricultural product.

Telling the story of where food
comes from
Maxi in Serbia put local
producers in the spotlight
through its Small Farmer Project
to help build customer trust in its
fruit and vegetable assortment.
The campaign focused on authentic stories
of local families that produce food for Maxi
stores. It was named the most memorable
corporate campaign in Serbia and helped
increase customer perception of the quality
of Maxi’s fruits and vegetables.

Market overview
The world around us is moving
fast and consumer needs keep
changing – in response, retailers
are transforming the shopping
experience with new formats,
products and technologies.

We have designed our Better Together strategy
to ensure our great local brands stay ahead
of these changes, build customer loyalty and
attract new shoppers. The trends we focus on
fall under three main categories: macro trends,
consumer trends and industry trends.

Macro trends

Economics

Everywhere we operate, consumers remain focused
on value. In the United States, economic growth
is expected to continue at a moderate pace in
2018. While the U.S. unemployment rate continues
to decline, consumer confidence levels are above
those of the peak in 2007. Europe’s forecast remains
positive, though growth is expected to slightly
decelerate when compared to previous years.
In the Netherlands, growth in purchasing power
remains relatively low, despite a growing GDP
and decreasing unemployment rate. In Belgium,
the economy is expected to continue to grow
moderately and inflation is expected to normalize
from the high levels we saw in 2017. A common
theme for the Central and Southeastern Europe
region will be the continued upward pressure on
wages resulting from low unemployment and / or
regulatory measures. More specifically, the Greek
market is expected to continue its slow recovery,
while Romania’s growth might slightly decelerate
compared to previous years. The Czech Republic
and Serbia are expected to face continued growth
and normalizing inflation.

Demographics

Population growth is slowing in all our markets,
especially in Europe, and the consumer base
is aging. This impacts retailers as older customers
show preferences for more luxurious and healthy
foods, meal solutions and home delivery and can
require more in-store assistance. In addition, our
communities are becoming increasingly diverse
in terms of ethnicity, household composition,
affluence and urban versus suburban, all of which
mean that customers are demanding more diverse
offerings from retailers.

Resource availability

The changing climate and a growing global
demand for food are putting natural resources
increasingly under pressure all over the world.
As resources such as water and soil nutrients
become scarcer, this will likely continue
to affect agriculture and our ability to source
certain products in the future. “Commodity
crunches” could substantially impact food
retailers because many of the products we
sell are based on raw materials like corn,
wheat and rice.

Technology

The pace of technological change is increasing
at an extraordinary rate, and this has direct
implications for our industry and the way people
shop. More of the objects that people use
every day, such as televisions, refrigerators and
personal wearables, are getting connected
to the Internet, and are tracking and
collecting data.
Companies are using this data to develop closer
relationships with shoppers by understanding
their personal preferences and being able
to cater to them – or even predict new ones.
This wealth of data supports the development
of artificial intelligence and automated devices
such as self-driving trucks and warehouse
robots. The exponential development of
technologies will impact the labor force and
companies have already started to think about
how to ensure associates have the right skills
going forward.

Market overview
continued

Consumer trends

Value

Nearly a decade after the 2008 economic
downturn, we are still feeling its effects, as
evidenced by a continued focus on value
and budget-consciousness and the growth
of low-cost players operating stores and online.
Consumers are also redefining what value means
to them as something much more personal than
in the past. They are less loyal to brands and
formats, and have the technology to quickly and
easily compare offers – so providing great value
for money remains a license to operate.
But being affordable increasingly means being
able to present customers with the right offers,
personalized to their needs, at the right time.

Convenience

Customers have busy lifestyles and are
increasingly pressed for time. While they are
more conscious of the need to eat healthier, they
have less time and ability to cook nutritious food.
This is especially true of the Millennial generation.
As a result, fresh ready meal offerings that can
be eaten immediately or quickly prepared at
home continue to grow in popularity. The need
for a fast and easy shopping experience also
extends to format choice, with customers looking
for smaller stores that are quicker to shop,
convenient locations that reduce their travel time
and cost, and multiple delivery options for their
online orders.

Health and well-being

Consumers are more aware of the relationship
between the food they eat and their overall health
and well-being; at the same time, diet-related
diseases – such as heart disease, diabetes and
malnutrition – remain a growing issue worldwide.
Customers want more transparency about what
is in their food, and want to understand the health
effects of, for example, additives like sweeteners
and artificial colors, or the use of plastics in
packaging and antibiotics to prevent disease in
animals. Consumers who are inspired to strive
for healthier and cleaner lifestyles are prioritizing
fruits, vegetables, nuts and grains or even
adopting vegetarian or vegan diets. We are seeing
a rapidly emerging trend towards personalized
nutrition, where consumers receive individual
advice based on elements such as their own
DNA, gut bacteria or habits.

Transparency and sustainability

In our markets, we believe food is safer today
than ever before. Nevertheless, consumers
remain concerned about food safety. They want
more information on where their food comes
from and how their buying decisions can impact
the environment and lives of people all over
the world, for example, through climate change
or working conditions. They expect retailers
to help them make sustainable choices, and
to ensure the integrity of the supply chain
wherever they can.
New technologies, such as blockchain, are
offering retailers and manufacturers opportunities
to improve supply chain transparency and
traceability.

Connection and communities

People everywhere are searching for a feeling
of community and personal connection. They
are getting involved in their local neighborhoods,
buying more local products and supporting local
businesses. In parallel, they connect with others
who share their interests and values on social
media and in online communities.

Industry trends

Consolidation

There is a great deal of consolidation today,
in both the retail and consumer packaged
goods industries, where companies seek
scale advantages in sourcing and other
areas. In addition to this, corporations are
increasingly cooperating with start-ups for
a number of reasons, among others to boost
growth and protect themselves from disruption.
Through partnerships and mergers and
acquisitions activities, companies are able
to secure access to new products, services
and / or capabilities, while serving both
existing and new customers.

Diversification

Channel and format diversification remains
prevalent in the retail industry. More and more,
customers shop for food at multiple retailers
in multiple segments – they want to get their
favorite products at the best possible price and
in the most efficient way. In the continuing effort
to respond to these customer needs, retailers
are developing their existing formats and adding
new ones, leading to increased competition.
Smaller household sizes and urbanization
mean that, in addition to value, customers are
showing a preference for stores that are easily
accessible. They are moving away from large
weekly grocery shopping trips and shopping
more often, visiting nearby supermarkets and
convenience stores more frequently.

Online and mobile

The total e-commerce market continues to
expand. It is expected to grow by 10-15% each
year through 2020 – and food e-commerce
is expected to grow even faster. With their
broad store base, traditional retailers are wellpositioned to serve the rising expectations
of customers who expect ever greater
convenience and faster delivery, including
same-day. Stores may become more hybrid
by catering to the needs of the traditional
shopper while also serving as micro fulfillment
centers. In addition to offering their own last-mile
services (through stores, pickup points and
home delivery), traditional retailers are starting
to deepen their relationships with third-party
delivery services, especially to fulfill customers’
need for immediate gratification.
Pure online companies are looking for physical
touchpoints to connect with consumers and
enhance the convenience and service they can
provide. They are launching often innovative
store-based formats that push the boundaries
of creating a more frictionless customer
experience. New interfaces, such as voice,
are increasingly popular, making it important
for retailers to have a multi-channel strategy.

Own brands

The importance of own brands continues to
grow, driven by factors that include Millennials’
pursuit of better value for money. While own
brands used to be inferior to national brands
in quality and packaging design, they are
achieving tremendous improvements in these
areas, and at a lower price-point compared to
equivalent national brands. This is particularly
true in the case of product lines focused on
organic or health and well-being.
Own brands continue to offer retailers an
opportunity to distinguish their brands from
the competition and to build customer loyalty.

Our stakeholders
Our stakeholders help us to get
better every day by challenging us,
giving us insight into their concerns,
offering feedback on how we are
doing, and collaborating with us
to solve the problems and issues
we all face. We engage with them
in both formal and informal ways
throughout the year.

As an international retailer, our list of stakeholders
is extensive. We consider three stakeholder
groups – customers, associates and communities
– as the ones most critical to serve to ensure we
are being the best retailer we can be. These are
the stakeholders to whom we link our promises to
be a better place to shop, a better place to work,
and a better neighbor. In addition, we commit
to transparency and high integrity with a broad
list of stakeholders that have a strong interest in
our company, including shareholders, suppliers
(many of whom are part of our local communities),
governments and NGOs.
For more information on how we respond
to our stakeholders’ needs see page 49

Celebrating centuries of serving customers

Our oldest brand, Delhaize Belgium,
celebrated its 150th anniversary
in 2017 with activities including
a donation to the Make-A-Wish
Foundation for each Delhaize
own-brand product sold with the
“150-years-Make-A-Wish” symbol.
Delhaize also held a successful wine fair
highlighting its 150 years of wine experience.

To mark its 130th anniversary,
Albert Heijn organized a special
symposium called “All the ingredients
for better living. For everyone.”
Approximately 200 guests attended,
including associates and representatives from
business, politics and industry organizations
– for roundtable discussions on themes
like the future of food; work and shopping;
technological developments; and sustainable
society. The day led to many valuable ideas
and insights that were incorporated into Albert
Heijn’s strategy and bundled in a commemorative
book to keep inspiring for years to come.

During 2017, we invited key internal and external
stakeholders to give us their feedback on Ahold
Delhaize’s most material economic, social and
environmental impacts. We have shared the results
of this feedback in our updated materiality matrix.
In 2015, United Nations member states around
the world adopted a set of goals to end poverty,
protect the planet and ensure prosperity for all
as part of their sustainable development agenda.
For these Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
to be reached, governments, the private sector
and civil society needs to act together. Along with
our stakeholders we recognize the importance of
this undertaking, and we support multiple SDGs
through our sustainability efforts as part of our
Better Together strategy. As a food retail company,
we have identified the SDGs on which we can
have the biggest impact and make a difference
for society in the long term.
See Our response to stakeholder needs and
Sustainability performance sections (pages 49
and 250 respectively) for more information on
our progress on SDG-related targets

Our stakeholders
continued

Customers

Customers are the lifeblood of our
businesses. Our great local brands
engage with them every time they
visit the stores or shop online.

How we engage with our customers
We stay tuned in to what they want through thirdparty surveys, consumer studies, focus groups,
and through the immediate feedback they provide
to our customer service departments, associates,
websites and social media.
How we are listening to our customers
Customers tell us they want competitive prices
and a great shopping experience. They want
healthier eating to be more accessible, more fun
and more delicious, and they want high-quality
products that are made with respect for people,
animals and the planet.
See examples of how we respond to our customers’
needs in: Our purpose page 30, Our sustainable
business model page 32, and Our promises page 38

Associates

Associates in our local brands
bring our strategy to life every day
for customers.

How we engage with our associates
They work together in collaborative, teambased settings in local stores, warehouses,
and corporate offices. All our brands leverage
formal touchpoints to engage associates such
as a regular performance review process,
recognition and reward programs, and interactive
training programs.
In 2017, we conducted an associate engagement
survey using a common platform across all
of our Ahold Delhaize brands. We had a strong
participation rate of 85% and saw an overall
engagement rate of 78%. Associates are proud
of our businesses and likely to recommend
them as good places to work. They enjoy a work
environment with a strong sense of purpose and
a high level of resources and support, where
diversity is valued. Associates would like to see
a continued focus on training, development and
well-being.
How we are listening to our associates
We aim to run strong businesses that offer
stable jobs and great careers and provide
working environments where associates are
respected and appreciated. Our businesses are
committed to the principles of equal employment
opportunities, freedom of association, and
respecting legal rights to collective bargaining.
See examples of great initiatives for and by associates
in: Our promises page 38, and Our values page 46

Communities

Our brands touch the lives of millions
of people every day and are in
continuous dialogue with members
of the broader communities where
they operate.
These communities are made up of many
different stakeholders, including governments,
civic organizations, schools, research institutes,
industry bodies, charitable organizations,
franchisees and affiliates, and of course, suppliers.
How we engage with our communities
We engage with communities in person, through
partnerships, memberships, sponsorships,
and in dialogue with key organizations that
overlap with our work as food retailers. With our
suppliers, we maintain multiple communication
channels, including face-to-face meetings, online
communication and supplier events. At a local
and global level, we play an active role in industry
associations and other bodies.
How we are listening to our communities
Our community stakeholders provide valuable
feedback, for example, on how we can be a
stronger partner in creating healthier communities.
Input from our suppliers, both local and global,
helps us to create better products for customers,
find new ways to reduce food waste and increase
economic, social and environmental value for
the communities we source from throughout the
supply chain.
See examples of our projects to build better
communities in: Our promises page 38

Shareholders

We strongly believe that by
serving customers, associates and
communities well, our businesses
will prosper and our shareholders
will benefit.

Our shareholders put their trust in us by investing
in Ahold Delhaize financially, and we respect their
input because it helps us become a better retailer.
How we engage with our shareholders
Shareholders monitor our company closely and
support and challenge us on our strategy and how
we manage our businesses. We communicate
with them through quarterly disclosures and
both financial and non-financial performance
briefings – such as during our annual General
Meeting of Shareholders and capital market days
– presentations and exchanges with analysts
and investors.
How we are listening to our shareholders
To demonstrate our commitment to long-term
success, our disclosures cover our financial
performance and our progress on our Better
Together strategy, including our targets to build
a more sustainable business.

Our Better Together strategy
Ahold Delhaize’s strategy is empowering
our great local brands to offer the best

Fresh stores, fresh inspiration
Food Lion is remodeling stores
in its markets in the Southeast
United States as part of the rollout
of its strategy: “Easy, Fresh and
Affordable … You Can Count on
Food Lion Every Day.”

The remodels enable Food Lion to bring fresh
inspiration to their customers and make specific
strategy elements come alive in ways that
customers can see and experience. In addition
to freshening up the look and feel of the stores,
the brand is upgrading checkouts to make it
faster and easier for customers to get in and
out quickly. Coupled with improved customer
service through the brand’s shift to a “count
on me” culture, the changes are yielding
impressive results, fueling sales growth at the
brand. In 2017, Food Lion remodeled a total
of 164 stores.

Save for our
customers
To jump-start this continuous cycle,
we always look for ways to save for
our customers. We evaluate every
area of our businesses to see where
we can do things smarter and better
to save money, conserve resources
and reduce waste.
Buy better
Our brands cultivate long-term partnerships
with suppliers, working together to innovate
and develop own-brand product ranges.
They also achieve savings through buying
alliances. In sourcing practices, we aim to
always operate in a competitive and fair way.

Operate smarter
Our local businesses are streamlining operations
to achieve cost efficiencies.
For more information on how we are operating
smarter to streamline shopping, see page 34

Waste less
Our brands are reducing shrink through
inventory controls, and through resourceful
initiatives, such as donating food that would
otherwise be wasted, to help people in need.

of our brands, regardless of their budget, so
our local businesses continue to make pricing
more competitive.

Best own brands
Each of our great local brands focuses on
building innovative own-brand product ranges,
such as our organic and free from lines, to keep
differentiating itself from other retailers and
maintain its competitive edge.

Fresher and healthier
Across Ahold Delhaize we believe our brands
have an opportunity and a responsibility to
make healthier eating easy, tasty, affordable and
rewarding for customers – especially through
broad fresh and healthier product assortments.
For more information on how we are providing
a fresher and healthier offering as part of our

Most local and personal service
Each great local brand works to build stronger
relationships with customers – through the service
provided by every associate in every store and
through best-in-class personalized offerings,
enabled by technology. Our brands target their
assortments to the needs of people in their
neighborhoods and sell a wide range of products
from local suppliers. By supporting the causes
that local customers and associates care about,
each brand deepens its involvement in the
local community.

Ahold Delhaize seeks to fund growth
in three key channels – supermarkets,
e-commerce and smaller formats – so
that our brands can be there wherever
and however customers shop.
Supermarkets
Supermarkets are the core channel and the main
focus of our investments. Our brands work to keep
their stores regularly refreshed and remodeled
so they remain appealing to customers. Across
the group we aim to be the #1 or #2 supermarket
brand in every local market where we operate.
For more information on how we are expanding
our supermarket business, see page 36

E-commerce
Across our brands, we continue to invest in
e-commerce, to make shopping more convenient,
affordable, personal and inspiring. Our great local
brands constantly improve the quality of their
service, tailor the assortment to meet or exceed
customer expectations, and make online shopping
available to more people.
For more information on how we are growing
our e-commerce business, see page 37

Smaller formats
Our brands are continuously developing their
small formats and testing new ones, to fulfill
customers’ growing demand for convenience.

Our sustainable business model in action

Operate smarter

The context
Retail has always been a
competitive industry, and customer
needs and new technologies are
driving transformative change
today more than ever.
Across channels, retailers are striving to offer
better, more innovative products and services
at a great value. Consumer expectations
are rising too. Shoppers want better quality
and more convenience – and all at affordable
prices. Retailers have to be smarter than
ever in order to give their customers what
they want and stay ahead of the competition
while operating in a sustainable way.

Our response
We set the wheel of our business
model in motion by saving for our
customers – and one important way
we do this is by operating smarter.

We are always looking for new ways of doing
things that streamline our operations and improve
our customers’ shopping experience. In doing
so, we are driven by our objectives to save costs,
save time and make life easier for both customers
and associates.

How we are delivering
on our strategy

Our U.S. brands are testing a unique new store
assistant – Marty the robot. With a friendly look and
googly eyes, Marty maneuvers around, performing
checks that help the store run more smoothly
and safely for both customers and associates.
The robot can scan the floor for slip or trip hazards
and page for clean-up assistance, and eventually
will be able to look for errors in shelf pricing and
identify out-of-stocks so that associates can
replenish the shelves and customers can find what
they need. Marty is currently roaming the aisles
of four Giant Carlisle stores during a pilot program,
and could be rolled out to additional stores across
the U.S. brands in 2018.

Save for
our customers

Our Dutch brand, Albert Heijn to go, is launching
new technology that streamlines the shopping
experience and takes grab-and-go convenience
to the next level. Called “tap to go,” it allows
customers to pay for items in a store without
going through a checkout line. Using a card
– and in the future a smartphone – customers
can select an item, tap an electronic shelf card
and go.

Most local and personal service

The context
In all our markets, people are
looking for a sense of connection,
with others across the world and
within their local communities –
even when they shop.
They want to buy products made close to
home and that make them feel part of the
community. They expect retailers to know
them and understand their individual needs.

Our response
Our brands are finding new ways
to create an emotional connection
with customers, often assisted
by technology.

We are building our digital capabilities and
expertise and continue to invest to offer customers
a personalized experience, both in our stores
and online. We rely on the use of data that enables
our brands to make it easier for customers to
save money, save time and eat healthier.

How we are delivering

Hannaford launched a new loyalty program and
Food Lion enhanced its loyalty program in 2017.
With Food Lion’s digital Shop & Earn program,
customers can save $20 or more each month
through personalized offers based on their
shopping behavior. Hannaford launched My
Hannaford Rewards, unique for a loyalty program
because it doesn’t rely on two-tiered pricing.
All Hannaford customers pay the same when they
shop, but customers participating in the all-digital
program receive a 2% reward when they purchase
own-brand products, plus personalized coupons
and special offers on the products they love.

Supermarkets

The context
Even with the rapid growth of
other shopping channels, including
online, supermarkets continue to
thrive, functioning as the physical
touchpoint where retailers can
interact with their customers on
a day-to-day basis.
Today’s customers go to the supermarket
not just to shop but to get information and
inspiration on how to eat better and live
healthier lives. Evolving from their traditional
role, stores are also increasingly serving as
hubs that give people in local communities
the opportunity to gather and connect.

Our response
To drive our business model, we
fund growth in three channels, but
supermarkets have always been
our core format.

Our brands have a strong heritage of
operating leading supermarkets for 150 years.
Supermarkets are still key to our strategy,
enabling us to inspire and connect with our
customers on a personal level. Our objective
is to be a leading supermarket brand in every
local market.

How we are delivering
on our strategy

Mega Image is one of the leading supermarket
chains in Romania with a clear number one
position in Bucharest. It continues to expand
beyond its core market by consolidating its
presence in existing markets and moving into
promising new ones – such as Cluj-Napoca
in 2017. Mega Image opened 69 new stores
this year, including 28 supermarkets outside
Bucharest, nine of which were in Cluj-Napoca,
bringing more customers a better place to
shop. The new stores are colorful and lively, with
a wide assortment and a focus on quality fresh,
natural and organic items. Dedicated associates
facilitate the shopping experience for customers,
and an optimized checkout process lets
shoppers pay quickly and be on their way.
As a result, Mega Image has found that once
customers come into their stores, they keep
coming back.

E-commerce

The context
As technological advances
race forward and online retail
continues to expand, customers
are demanding more and more
from online shopping.

They expect a broad assortment of products
to choose from, an easy shopping experience
and ever-faster delivery – sometimes
within the same day or even within hours.
Retailers are rising to meet these needs with
new and innovative devices and services
that are revolutionizing shopping.

Our response
We have the ambition to deliver
close to €5 billion in online sales by
2020, and are well on track to reach
our goal.

Our omni-channel strategy is aimed at helping
our brands provide a seamless online and in-store
experience and make shopping easier and more
entertaining. We continue to accelerate investment
in our e-commerce businesses to enable
customers to shop when and how they want,
and to drive sales growth.

can get unlimited free deliveries for a certain
period of time. Both Peapod and Albert Heijn
offer delivery subscription services – Peapod’s

Our promises in action

Best own brands

The context
Through own brands, retailers are
able to develop product lines that
fit the needs of customers in their
local markets while at the same
time providing good value.

These product lines continue to grow in
popularity as customers seek to get more for
their money – whether more, to them, means
quality, taste, health, sustainability, or even
benefits to society. Retailers who develop
distinctive own brands are able to differentiate
themselves and build customer loyalty.

Our response
Our local businesses have made
own brands a critical component of
their strategies – some of them even
achieve more than half of all sales
from their own-brand assortments.

These product lines are tailored to local customer
preferences, with an increasing focus on being
healthier and more sustainable. Now more than
ever, we are sharing own brands across our
businesses to capitalize on the strength of our
brands, and we are using our scale to drive
change in the supply chain and provide more
sustainable products at lower prices.
To help us source smarter and keep improving
our own brands, we are partnering with buying
alliance AMS in Europe and have created an
own-brands center of excellence to serve all
our brands in the U.S.

How we are delivering
on our strategy

Our “free from” and organic own-brand lines
are highly differentiating and strategically
important for the U.S. brands, so they set a goal
to reach $1 billion in sales by the end of 2017.
At Stop & Shop, Giant Landover and Giant Carlisle,
the own-brand teams accelerated product
development and innovation on their Nature’s
Promise brand and expanded the range to include
baby, health and beauty care, pet and household.
At the same time, they improved the safety
and sustainability and began rating own-brand
products against the Guiding Stars nutritional
criteria. By year-end, the range of Nature’s
Promise included around 1,450 items and annual
sales reached a record high of $727 million.
Combined sales of Nature’s Promise and the
Nature’s Place brand at Food Lion and Hannaford
reached the billion dollar goal in 2017. During
2018, the two own-brand lines will be combined
into one, Nature’s Promise, and offered across
our U.S. market area.

The context
As health conditions such as heart
disease and diabetes remain
on the rise across the globe,
we are becoming more aware
of the link between nutrition
and overall health.

Eating healthier, fresh food is a growing
priority for people in all our markets, but they
also demand convenience and great value.
Consumers have more choices than ever for
how they procure and prepare meals, driven
by the growth of options like e-commerce
and meal kit delivery. They look for retailers to
provide inspiration and help them put delicious
and nutritious meals on the table in an easy
and affordable way.

Our response
We believe our food retail brands have
an opportunity and a responsibility
to make healthier eating tasty,
affordable and rewarding
for customers.

They do this by providing quality fresh assortments
– particularly through own brands – transparent
nutritional labeling, healthy ideas and recipes,
and educational programs.
Due to great progress in 2017, and applying
the Guiding Stars and Choices nutritional criteria
across more of our brands, we have exceeded
our original 2020 target of 45% healthy own-brand
food sales and raised our ambition to reach 50%
by 2020.
We believe our company is leading among
retailers in tracking, reporting and setting targets
on healthy product sales. By supporting good
health in our communities, we support the longterm health of our business.

How we are delivering
on our strategy

Hannaford rewarded customers for buying
healthy products by donating more than $400,000
to local food banks during a popular campaign
last summer. Whenever customers purchased
nutritious products earning at least one Guiding
Star from its nutrition navigation program, the
brand made a donation to hunger relief.
Prediabetes affects 84 million Americans and can
lead to type 2 diabetes. In 2017, Giant Landover
launched a Diabetes Prevention Program in eight
stores. Taught by the brand’s in-store nutritionists,
it is a year-long lifestyle change program
championed by the Center for Disease Control.
Participants learn about healthy eating, label
reading, energy balance, physical activity, and
stress management.

Albert Heijn is reformulating own-brand products
by reducing sugar, salt and saturated fat.
For example, the brand is helping customers
cut sugar consumption by reducing the sugar
content in all of its fresh fruit drinks by as much
as 30% and has expanded its “Friswijzer” sugar
navigation system to include child-portioned
beverage packs. A color-coded shelf sign
shows how much sugar a product contains and
what type of sweetener it uses, helping parents
manage their families’ sugar intake. Our U.S.
brands are also reformulating their own-brand
products to offer healthier choices to customers.
They removed nearly half a million kilograms
of sugar from these products last year.

Associate development

The context
Retail is a people business –
having engaged associates who
love what they do and are able to
build relationships with customers
makes it possible for a company
to thrive in today’s challenging,
fast-paced environment.
And employees want more out of a job
than just a paycheck – they want to feel like
they are growing, learning and making a
difference. Companies that give their people
the opportunity to grow and develop are likely
to be more successful in the long term.

Our response
All of our brands have the goal to
put in place a strong learning culture.

The ambition is to help our associates love what
they do by making learning a part of everyday
work, with inspiring and innovative learning
approaches. People are connecting so they can
learn from each other and our brands are helping
leaders grow and know how to develop their
teams. All of our brands are working on new ways
to bring a learning culture and strong leadership
development opportunities to life.

How we are delivering
on our strategy

Delhaize Belgium organizes Top Chef Top Team
trainings, where chefs and experts from the stores
are able to build an even more solid knowledge
base on products in an experiential way through
supplier visits, workshops, and tasting events such
as a recent seafood trip. They can bring these
learnings back to their teams, with the help of
training tips and tricks; in this way, associates have
the opportunity to develop while at the same time
better serving our customers.
Albert Heijn created the Warm Welcome project
to ensure the nearly 35,000 new associates joining
the company each year quickly feel at home, know
what is expected of them and can work within
their teams to make a great store for customers.
They developed a welcome package to use for
onboarding, including a virtual reality welcome
movie and app and an intranet page for managers
to share best practices. Feedback has been great,
with 100% of associates saying they experienced
a warm welcome.

Diversity and inclusion

The context
We are living in an increasingly
global world, with populations
becoming ever more diverse.

Consequently, we believe it is more important
than ever for retailers to be adaptable and
innovative. Having a business that embraces
diversity and inclusion is not only the right
thing to do but also strategically important
to retailers.

Our response
We recognize that diversity and
inclusion are critical to our company’s
success – they make us better together
and increase associate engagement.
Therefore, we have made them a key priority
in our promise to be a better place to work, and
have initiatives across our businesses focused
on creating an inclusive work environment and
promoting diversity.

How we are delivering
on our strategy

Food Lion and Hannaford in the U.S.
continued to focus on diversity and inclusion,
providing expanded learning and development
opportunities this year to more than 1,350
associates. Hannaford started a new Business
Resource Group (BRG): Veterans & Military,
bringing the total number of BRGs for both
brands to 13. Working with the BRGs, Food
Lion updated the ethnic haircare and Hispanic
specialty product assortments to better serve
diverse customers – and achieved increased
sales. Both Food Lion and Hannaford also
participated in events supporting the LGBT
community and launched LGBT greeting cards
in their stores.

The context
Food retailers often operate at

serve – they provide customers
with the staples of daily life and
a meeting place to come together

We believe that the success of a food retailer
is closely connected to the success of its
community. Customers expect food retailers
to act responsibly and support causes that
are locally important.

Our response
We partner with stakeholders at
the local level to create healthier,
more sustainable communities for
future generations.

The Ahold Delhaize brands have a strong legacy
of investing in the communities we serve by
working with local organizations, and donating
money, products and even time through associate
volunteers. We also work further afield to help
our supplier communities in places like Africa.

As food retailers, we are well-positioned and

communities. In 2017, Food Lion remodeled and
stocked the shelves of 60 local food pantries
across its 10-state operating area in the Southeast
U.S. during its third annual “The Great Pantry
Makeover” initiative. The remodeling ranged from
installing shelves, painting and cleaning pantries
to installing equipment enabling the pantries
to expand capacity for fresh fruits, vegetables
and other products. During the four-month effort,
Food Lion donated more than 2.5 million meals
and 2,000 volunteer hours as part of its largest
associate volunteer initiative.

2017

During times of acute need – such as extreme
weather situations – our local brands do what
they can to be there for their communities and
support causes that customers care about.
Following Hurricane Harvey, Giant Carlisle,
Giant Landover and Stop & Shop donated
$250,000 (€209,700) in cash, food and supplies
to help with relief and recovery efforts and
offered stores to serve as collection points for
customer food donations. The same brands
donated an additional $250,000 to the American
Red Cross after Hurricane Irma.
In Greece, Alfa Beta provided support following
dangerous flash floods that devastated
areas around Athens. AB donated €500,000
to provide food and supplies to more than
2,000 households.

2016

2017

2020 Target

*Target is a 20% reduction from 2016

The context
Globally, food waste is a serious
problem – approximately one-third
of food is wasted each year.

This has a negative impact on communities
that miss out on valuable nutrients, but also on
the environment, since food waste is one of the
largest sources of greenhouse gases. For this
reason, the UN Sustainable Development
Goals set a global target to cut food waste in
half worldwide by 2030. Positioned between
suppliers and customers in the value chain,
retailers have the potential to drive new habits
that produce less food waste and contribute
to this goal.
However, it can be a challenge to balance
food waste reduction and other priorities.
For example, as retailers work to reduce
unnecessary packaging, they need to make
sure that food is still safe and protected.

Our response
Since 2016, we have been measuring
food waste at all our brands, using the
industry’s Food Loss & Waste Protocol.
This has enabled us to start better managing the
issue company-wide, and we have committed
to reduce our own food waste by 20% between
2016 and 2020.
We take a three-pronged approach to reducing
food waste in our own operations, focusing on
prevention, donation and recycling. In addition,
we partner with suppliers to reduce food waste
and encourage customers to reduce waste after
they bring the food home.

How we are delivering
on our strategy

Hannaford’s efforts to reduce food waste were
highlighted in a major study commissioned
by the Rockefeller Foundation and the
Initiative for a Competitive Inner City (ICIC).
Hannaford exemplifies our three-pronged
approach – first preventing food waste in its stores,
then donating all safe and unsold food through
a partnership with Feeding America, and finally
recycling the remaining food waste or turning it
into energy. Their efforts enabled them to reduce
food waste in their operations by 30%.

Teams at Delhaize Belgium have excelled
at preventing food from becoming waste by
optimizing the use of automated warehouses to
minimize the time between receipt and delivery
of fresh products, adjusting the assortment in
the stores and donating unsold food to charities
– resulting in the lowest food waste per sales
among all our brands.
Two of our brands – Albert Heijn and Delhaize
Belgium – recycle 100% of food waste through
the various means available in each market.
In 2017, we used the waste reduction model
developed by the Environmental Protection
Agency to estimate the impact of all of our food
waste reduction activities on our greenhouse gas
emissions. The model suggests we prevented
approximately 224,000 tonnes of equivalent
CO2 emissions, or 5% of our total emissions.

Our values in action
Our values support an ethical
culture and are the foundation
of our commitment to conduct our
business by doing the right thing,
every day.

Bringing our values to life
Because we believe it is so essential
for associates to understand our
values and what they mean to their
daily work, in 2017, we rolled out
our shared values in ways that fit
our different internal audiences.
For example, our global support office hosted
a values week to build awareness, and made
it engaging, informal and fun, in line with our
“humor” value – such as through selfies with
values role models and communicating the
values through food. We also integrated the
values into our formal processes and practices
to embed them within the organization.

Protecting our information
through Living Data
As technology-driven innovation
contributes to our company’s
growth, we are increasingly
vigilant against cyber-attacks.

We care about the information people trust
us with. An important piece of the puzzle
is ensuring that associates know what to do
to protect our systems. We launched “Living
Data,” a company-wide information security
awareness program that aims at protecting all
our data, especially information our associates
and customers share with us. The program
includes a campaign on preventing phishing,
annual “Living Data Day” events at our
corporate locations, a computer-based
training for store managers and corporate
associates and real-time notifications warning
of impending threats. Associates throughout
the company have embraced the program.

Anti-corruption and bribery
Being a trustworthy retailer of choice is
very important to us. We are committed to
conducting business with integrity, in an ethically
responsible manner and complying with the
law in all countries and jurisdictions in which we
operate. Ahold Delhaize prohibits all activity that
constitutes bribery or corruption. Our Code of
Ethics describes our commitment to integrity
and ethical business practices and specifically
includes compliance with laws relating to anticorruption and bribery in the countries in which
our businesses operate or which are applicable
to their operations.
For more detailed information on the
Code of Ethics and Anti-corruption and bribery
policy, visit our website

Human rights
We are committed to respecting the human rights
of associates, customers, communities and the
people who work throughout our supply chains.
This commitment is based on our collective belief
that all people should be treated with dignity
and respect and is derived from international
principles, such as the UN Universal Declaration
of Human Rights and the UN Guiding Principles
on Business and Human Rights. Key elements
of our Human Rights Position are incorporated
into our Code of Ethics. Local “ethics helplines”
are free, confidential and secure services that
enable our associates and the public to raise
concerns about improper behavior or possible
violations of law or policy.

Our response to stakeholder needs
To ensure that our strategy continues
to address the issues that pose significant
risks or opportunities to our businesses and
our broad group of stakeholders, each year
we perform a materiality assessment
that evaluates the relevance of economic,
social, and environmental topics.
Through it, we confirm and update our list of
material topics and identify emerging topics that
are important for our company to consider when
developing future strategy.

Some of our material topics overlap with
the key business risks we identified through
our Enterprise Risk Management process;
see How we manage risk for more information.

Our response to stakeholder needs

The overall outcome of the materiality assessment
is that it reconfirmed our focus areas, such as
promoting healthier eating and providing safe
and high quality products, produced with respect
for people and the environment. These topics
have been managed as part of our sustainability
strategy since the merger and have specific
performance indicators and targets that were
set in 2016.
The assessment also provided insights into
additional topics where our business has
a strong societal impact, but that do not yet
impact decision-making for a wide segment of
our stakeholders. These topics – such as “animal
based protein,” “plastics” and “sustainable
agriculture” – are ones we have identified as
needing further strategic review to understand
if our current management approach is
robust enough.

Topic

Product safety
and quality

Description

The safety and quality of
products we sell
(GRI Aspect: 416 Customer Health
and Safety)

Management approach

Selling safe, high-quality products is critical to maintaining customer trust. Our product integrity policies and
procedures set high standards for both safety and quality with our own-brand suppliers. Our operations
policies ensure strong safety and quality management within our distribution centers and through to our stores,
including regular facility audits by third parties to confirm compliance.
We require all our suppliers to go beyond what is legally required for food safety practices. Achieving stringent
certifications is challenging, particularly for Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises. We work with those
suppliers to help them achieve an acceptable level of assurance and to identify areas for improvement.
2020 target:
• 100% of own-brand food production sites certified against GFSI (Global Food Safety Initiative),
or in compliance with an acceptable level of assurance standard.

Affordable and
healthy products

The affordability and
accessibility of products we sell
that meet the dietary needs and
preferences of customers and
help them lead active and
healthier lives
(GRI Aspect: 416 Customer Health
and Safety)

Offering affordable, healthy products is a key component of our Better Together strategy. For tracking
purposes, we designate healthy own-brand products as those that meet nutritional criteria (using the Guiding
Stars system in the U.S. and the Choices criteria in Europe and Indonesia). We drive our target through product
innovation, assortment changes, promotions and pricing. Supporting customers in shifting to a healthier diet is
not an easy task. To help them make healthier choices, our brands research customer health needs in their
markets and assess the effectiveness of their initiatives to help customers shift to a healthier diet. In response
to consumer demand, we are also increasing our organic range and offering more products that do not contain
artificial ingredients.
2020 targets:
• 50% of own-brand food sales from healthy products
• 100% of own-brand products with front-of-pack nutritional labeling

Price of products

Product pricing compared
to the competition and consumer
perception on price levels

Being “Affordable for all” is a key component of our Better Together strategy. Consumer price perception is
based on many factors – not only on actual prices – therefore it is important to measure it regularly in all our
markets. Local price strategies are influenced by various local market specifics, our competitors and our
perceived and desired brand position in these markets. Our brands monitor and analyze pricing to perform
competitively in their local markets, drive economic performance and market share, and ensure healthy food
remains affordable.

Carbon emissions

Description

Impact on the climate emissions
of our supply chain and own
operations (stores, distribution
centers and logistics)
(GRI Aspects: 302 Energy,
305 Emissions, 306 Effluents
and Waste)

Management approach

Our brands are actively improving energy-efficiency, reducing refrigerant leakages, increasing the use
of natural refrigerants, and improving transport efficiencies. We also recognize food waste and global
deforestation as significant contributors to climate emissions, so have set targets to cut food waste and
to source sustainably for commodities linked to deforestation (palm oil, soy, and wood fibers).
Our brands are also taking steps to reduce supply chain emissions, including through projects with suppliers
to develop and transport products to us with fewer emissions. Measuring emissions along our value chain has
been a challenge, and one that we are working to solve so that we can further reduce climate impact.
2020 targets:
• 30% reduction in CO2 equivalent emissions (compared to 2008) from our own operations
• 100% certified sustainable sourcing of palm oil, soy, and wood fibers in own-brand products
• 20% food waste reduction compared to 2016 (tonnes / € million food sales)

Local sourcing
and production

Buying products from
local suppliers to increase
the availability of fresh food
and support local economies
(GRI Aspect: 204 Procurement
Practices)

Our local brands have a long history of sourcing local products, in response to customer demands for fresh,
seasonal food and traditional products from their regions.

Deforestation
and biodiversity

The impact of our products
on global deforestation and
biodiversity
(GRI Aspect: 304 Biodiversity)

Driving sustainability in the supply chain is a difficult challenge for a single retailer to solve, but we take our
responsibility seriously and play an active role in the Consumer Goods Forum together with other partners in
the industry. In addition, we take an active role in global roundtables (such as the Roundtable on Sustainable
Palm Oil) to help the global market shift more quickly to sustainable practices.

We manage local sourcing in a variety of ways ranging from operating programs like “Close to Home” at
Hannaford that facilitates sourcing from local producers to offering own-brand product lines focused on local
items, such as “Close to Greek Nature” at Alfa Beta and “Gusturi Romanesti” at Mega Image. This is not an
area that we measure and monitor globally, as it is fully managed by our brands in their local markets.

We continue our long-standing commitment to source sustainable seafood in order to protect biodiversity
in oceans and rivers. Our brands work directly with suppliers, particularly for fruits and vegetables, to
encourage the use of practices that protect biodiversity (such as Integrated Pest Management).
2020 targets:
• 100% certified sustainable sourcing of palm oil, soy, wood fibers, tea, coffee
and cocoa in own-brand products
• 100% of own-brand seafood product sales certified as sustainable

Healthy and
sustainable diets

Description

The impact of our products,
services, and the information
that we provide on facilitating
healthier and more sustainable
diets for our customers and
associates
(GRI Aspect: 416 Customer Health
and Safety)

Management approach

Our brands are committed to promoting healthier eating among customers and associates. To meet these
commitments, the brands are driving innovation towards healthier products (such as by reducing sugar, salt,
and fat in own-brand products), introducing new product lines (such as new vegetarian and vegan offerings),
and improving product sustainability (through sustainable sourcing requirements for suppliers). In addition,
the brands offer services to help customers shift their diets, such as employing dietitians in the stores to give
advice on developing healthier eating habits.
The brands also provide information to customers and associates on healthier diets through websites, local
magazines, social media, and in-store guidance. Addressing the move to more sustainable diets is newer
for our brands. In 2017, Giant Landover successfully rolled out the “How Good” product rating system,
which scores products on their sustainability impacts and makes it easy to find more sustainable options.
While the products, services, and information aimed at customers also helps inform our associates, we
have committed to increasing our focus on supporting associates in moving toward healthier habits, with
each brand developing annual plans to improve their work in this area.
2020 targets:
• 50% of own-brand food sales from healthy products
• 100% sustainable sourcing for seven commodities in our own-brand products
(tea, coffee, cocoa, seafood, palm oil, soy, wood fibers)
• 80% of own-brand production units meeting social compliance standards
Additional KPIs:
• Percentage of total food sales from certified-organic products
• Sales from free-from or organic own-brand product lines

Economic
performance

The financial performance of
the company and our economic
impact on communities
(GRI Aspect: 201 Economic
Performance)

The financial performance of the company is essential for operating a sustainable business and is closely
managed by executive management at group and brand level. We have a clear financial framework to
support our strategy and aim to maintain a high return on capital. Our brands are active supporters of
the economies they operate in, through providing jobs, purchasing from local suppliers and supporting
valuable community programs. See Group financial review for more information and specific financial
performance indicators.
As part of our promise to be a better neighbor, we seek to make a positive impact in the communities in
which our brands operate. One way Ahold Delhaize does this is through the taxes we pay. In this respect
we take into consideration social and corporate responsibility and the interest of all our stakeholders.
Our overall tax approach is in line with Ahold Delhaize’s overall business principles and code of ethics.
Our tax policy is published on our website.

Associate wages

Description

The adequacy and equality
of wages we pay, and the
impact this has on the
communities we operate in

Management approach

Ahold Delhaize employs 369,000 associates in nine countries. In determining the employment conditions
of associates, we set compensation and benefits levels in line with associates’ job levels and local market
practices. The remuneration practices in each of our local markets are regularly reviewed to take into account
the market dynamics and economic conditions. We are committed to the key principle of fair and equitable
treatment of all associates as we determine remuneration policies. We believe associates are the core of our
business and we assess their well-being and opinions on various topics each year through our associate
engagement survey.
KPIs:
• Associate engagement survey score
• Percentage of associates who work part-time and full-time

Associate
safety, health
and well-being

Safety of our associates at work,
and the impact of our actions on
associate health and well-being
(GRI Aspect: 403 Occupational
Health and Safety)

We measure and monitor accidents, occupational illness and related absenteeism and set annual targets to
further increase safety measures for our associates. We integrate safe working conditions into our workplace
designs, equipment purchases and operational procedures. We build visibility and awareness with our
leaders and associates on the impact of life-altering injuries and fatalities.
We support associates’ health and well-being through brand-level programs, such as the associate social
support program “Alfa Beta Social Services” at our Greek brand and “Healthy Albert Wednesday” through
which associates in the Czech Republic are offered fresh fruit and the opportunity to taste healthy own-brand
products. An example of a program that embeds safety into work practice is the “Safety Lead Certification”
program at Stop & Shop in the U.S. Emerging leaders participate in a multi-faceted program to support their
understanding of injury prevention and their role in keeping people safe.
2020 target:
• Score of 75 on index of healthy workplace questions in associate engagement survey
Additional KPIs:
• Rate of lost days due to accidents
• Rate of occupational illnesses per million hours worked
• Associate engagement survey index on “healthy workplace”

Description

How human rights are
respected along our supply chain
(GRI Aspects: 407 Freedom of
Association and Collective
Bargaining, 408 Child Labor,
409 Forced or Compulsory Labor,
414 Supplier Social Assessment)

Management approach

We require our suppliers in high-risk countries to be audited against the amfori BSCI Standard to
ensure good working conditions within our supply chain. Ahold Delhaize and each of our local brands are
committed to maintaining a high standard of business ethics and regard for human rights throughout the
supply chain. In 2017, we adopted a position on Human Rights that outlines our commitment to respecting
human rights. Supplier requirements are defined in our Standards of Engagement, which are mandatory for
all own-brand suppliers.
Even with multiple measures and controls in place, we realize that challenges remain for our industry, due
to lengthy supply chains that often span the world and are not always fully transparent. For this reason, we
joined the work of the Consumer Goods Forum on forced labor as well as the Seafood Task Force on human
trafficking and forced labor in off-shore fishing. With respect to wages in our supply chain, we are analyzing,
in close collaboration with UTZ, the effects of introducing a living wage for coffee production workers in
Kenya. These results will help us realistically and constructively deal with the wage gap in developing
countries, which we can then apply to other products and regions.
Both our Position on Human Rights and the Standards of Engagement can be found on our website.
2020 target:
• 80% of own-brand production units meeting social compliance standards (ambition of 100% after 2020)

Impact on local
communities

Impact of our business
on the communities where
our brands operate
(GRI Aspect: 413 Local
Communities)

We promise to be a better neighbor to the communities in which we operate. Our brands deliver on this
promise, for example, by creating great places to work, reducing waste, buying from local suppliers, and
building green facilities that support more sustainable communities. In our charitable contributions and
community investments, we focus on promoting healthier eating, fighting hunger and strengthening
communities. Our brands engage with local communities through a diverse set of programs, including
partnerships with local food banks, sponsorship of educational programs on healthier eating for children,
direct involvement with local charitable organizations and through associate volunteering events.

Description

The diversity of our associates
(including age, gender, ethnicity

it reflects the diversity of the
communities where we operate
(GRI Aspect: 405 Diversity and
Equal Opportunity)

Management approach

We measure associate perception on diversity through an annual associate engagement survey and set
annual targets to drive progress. We are committed to creating an inclusive workplace by hiring and retaining
a diverse population of associates that reflects the communities that our brands serve every day. We
integrate diversity and inclusion into our associates’ value proposition through hiring practices and leadership
development programs and we regularly provide innovative training to drive a more inclusive workplace
culture. In 2017, our U.S. businesses were recognized for their commitment by earning a perfect score on
the Human Rights Campaign’s Corporate Equality Index – the only retail grocery company to do so.

Food waste

Food that goes to waste (is not
eaten by people) along the value
chain: in the supply chain,
distribution, stores and in
customers’ homes
(GRI Aspect: 306 Effluents and
Waste)

We minimize food waste in our own operations through prevention and re-directing unsold food to feed
people (through donations or new business models such as the “InStock” food rescue restaurants in the
Netherlands). For the food waste that we cannot eliminate, we continue to expand recycling. To prevent food
waste, we focus on optimizing store replenishment and on-shelf management. Our brands identify new ways
to partner with food banks in all our markets to redistribute more unsold food to people in need. For example,
Delhaize Belgium brought together more than 200 members from their local communities to mark the fifth
anniversary of their fresh food donation program, which redistributes unsold fresh food from all of their stores
to people in need.
2020 target:
• 20% food waste reduction (tonnes / € million food sales)
• 90% food waste recycled
Additional KPIs:
• Tonnes of food waste sent to disposal per food sales
• Percentage of unsold food donated to feed people

Group financial review
On July 24, 2016, the merger
between Ahold and Delhaize
Group became effective. From
a legal standpoint, the merger was
implemented by Delhaize Group
NV/SA merging into Koninklijke
Ahold N.V., with the entity renamed
as Koninklijke Ahold Delhaize N.V.

Consequently, Delhaize Group’s financial results
have been included in our consolidated financial
statements since the merger date, affecting
comparability of the 2017 financial results to the
2016 results. Due to the significance of Delhaize
Group’s results to the Company, the Delhaize
Group sales and operating expense categories
that are included for the full year in 2017 are the
main drivers of the changes in results of operations
when compared to the 2016 results.

This review also provides numbers and analysis
on a pro forma basis. The pro forma data is
based on the assumption that the merger
became effective on the first day of Ahold’s
2015 financial year. This provides a comparative
basis, for illustrative purposes, to facilitate
assessment of the current performance of the
combined Company.
We made the following main adjustments to
the combined historical data to arrive at the
pro forma information:
• Exclusion of the performance of remedy
stores and other divestments
• Exclusion of merger transaction costs
• Inclusion of purchase price allocation effects
on Delhaize assets and liabilities, impacting
depreciation and amortization, net interest
expense and rent
• Alignment of Global Support Office functions
and related costs
• Alignment of foreign exchange rates for
consolidation of foreign group entities

Ahold Delhaize continued to see strong sales growth in its online businesses. The Company’s online
businesses contributed €2,376 million to Ahold Delhaize’s net sales in 2017 (2016: €1,991 million).
Ahold Delhaize’s net consumer online sales amounted to €2,814 million and increased in 2017 by

In addition to the merger, sales growth was driven
by new store openings and comparable sales
growth. Comparable sales growth was driven
by sales growth in our e-commerce businesses
and Albert Heijn’s strong growth during the year,
with a higher average purchase amount per visit
in the Netherlands. Comparable sales growth at
our brands in the United States was adversely
impacted by the deflationary environment in the
beginning of the year. In Belgium, comparable
sales declined as the performance of companyowned stores was only partly offset by the better
performance of the affiliated stores and the stores
in Luxembourg. In the Central and Southeastern
Europe (CSE), the good performance in all four
markets was partly offset by Greece, since
Greece recorded an exceptionally strong sales
performance in 2016 and the fourth quarter
of 2015 as result of competitive disruption.
The group’s sales growth was partly offset by
closed stores.

Gross profit
Ahold Delhaize’s gross profit increased by
€3,391 million, or 25.3%, compared to 2016.
At constant exchange rates, gross profit increased
by €3,645 million, or 27.8%. This increase was
primarily driven by the merger with the Delhaize
Group. Gross profit margin (gross profit as a
percentage of net sales) for 2017 was 26.7%,
a decrease of 0.2 percentage points compared
to 26.9% in 2016.
This decrease was primarily driven by the inclusion
of the full year results of the former Delhaize
Group operations. Delhaize America and Belgium
operate with a lower gross margin and with lower
operating expenses as a percentage of sales.
This was in part offset by higher gross margins
as result of synergies.

Operating expenses
In 2017, operating expenses increased by
€2,750 million, or 23.3%, to €14,544 million,
compared to €11,794 million in 2016. At constant
exchange rates, operating expenses increased
by €2,972 million, or 25.7%. This increase was
primarily driven by the inclusion of the full year
results of the former Delhaize Group operations.
As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses
decreased by 0.6% to 23.1%, compared to
23.7% in 2016. Excluding gasoline sales and
at constant exchange rates, operating expenses
as a percentage of net sales decreased by
0.6 percentage points.
This decrease of 0.6 percentage points is mainly
due to the addition of the former Delhaize Group
operations and by lower impairments, higher gains
on the sale of assets, lower transaction cost related
to the merger and restructuring charges.
Operating expenses include impairments, gains
(losses) on the sale of assets, restructuring and
related charges, and other items that management
believes can distort an understanding of the trend
related to the development of our underlying
business. Impairments, gains (losses) on the sale
of assets and restructuring and related charges
are summarized below.

Impairment of assets
Ahold Delhaize recorded the following
impairments and reversals of impairments
of assets in 2017 and 2016:

Impairment charges in 2017 were €64 million,

The impairments in 2017 were primarily related
to underperforming stores and the closure of

primarily related to remedy stores and other
divestments at Ahold USA (€46 million) and to
other store operations.

Restructuring and related charges and other items
in 2017 were €214 million, down by €19 million
compared to 2016.
In 2017, the restructuring and related charges
of €214 million included €107 million of integration
costs related to the merger between Ahold and
Delhaize, €36 million related to the divestment
of the remedy stores and other divestments
and €40 million related to the set-up of the U.S.
brand-centric organization. The 2017 integration
cost included a one-time €25 million benefit
related to an alignment of pension benefits at
our U.S. operations.
In 2016, the restructuring and related charges
of €233 million included €38 million of transaction
costs and €107 million of integration costs related
to the merger between Ahold and Delhaize, as
well as €26 million related to the divestment of the
remedy stores and other divestments. In 2016,
this also included a lump-sum compensation
for a reduction in benefits for employees in the
Netherlands and at the Global Support Office
(€35 million).

Operating income
Operating income in 2017 increased by
€641 million, or 40.5%, to €2,225 million
compared to €1,584 million in 2016. The increase
of €641 million is the difference between the
higher gross profit of €3,391 million and higher
operating expenses of €2,750 million. The changes
in gross profit and operating expenses are
explained above.
Net financial expenses
Net financial expenses in 2017 decreased by
€244 million, or 45.1%, to €297 million compared
to €541 million in 2016. This primarily related
to a decrease in Other financial expenses
(€252 million) mainly due to the one-off finance
cost of €243 million in 2016 relating to the buyback
of the JPY 33,000 million notes.

Income taxes
In 2017, income tax expense excluding the impact
of tax rate changes due to the U.S. and Belgian
tax reforms was €553 million, up by €306 million
compared to €247 million in 2016. This increase
in income tax expense is mainly the result of
increased earnings before tax and one-time
items in 2017. The effective tax rate, calculated
as a percentage of income before income tax,
excluding the impact of tax rate changes due to
the U.S. and Belgian tax reforms, was 28.7% in
2017 (2016: 23.7%). The increase in the effective
tax rate from 23.7% to 28.7% is mainly the result
of a change in the geographical mix of earnings
and one-time items in 2017.
The 2017 tax expense, including the one-time
impact of tax rate changes due to the U.S.
and Belgian tax reforms, was €146 million.
The effective tax rate, calculated as a percentage
of income before income tax, including the
one-time impact of tax rate changes due to the
U.S. and Belgian tax reforms, was 7.6% in 2017
(2016: 23.7%).

Group performance on a pro forma basis

The following is a summary of Ahold Delhaize’s 2017 and 2016 consolidated income statements on a
pro forma basis. The pro forma information in this financial review presents a picture of what the financial
results would have been if the merger between Ahold and Delhaize Group had occurred on the first
day of Ahold’s 2015 financial year, using the fair values established as of the July 23, 2016, merger
date as the basis for the purchase price allocation effects and related amortization on the identified
fair value changes. The information is not intended to revise past performance, but instead to provide
a comparative basis for the assessment of current performance.

Net sales
On a pro forma basis, net sales increased by 0.6% to €62,694 million, or by 1.7% at constant exchange
rates. Sales growth was driven by new store openings and comparable sales growth and in part offset
by closed stores. Growth was mainly the result of sales growth at our online businesses, Albert Heijn’s
strong growth during the year, with a higher average purchase amount per visit in the Netherlands, and
sales growth at Central and Southeastern Europe (CSE). Delhaize America grew comparable sales
and Ahold USA’s comparable sales growth was flat despite the deflationary environment in the United
States during the first part of the year. In Belgium, comparable sales were down 0.2%. In CSE, the good
performance in all four markets was partly offset by Greece, since Greece recorded an exceptionally
strong sales performance in 2016 and the fourth quarter of 2015 as a result of competitive disruption.

In 2017, net synergies of €268 million were
delivered: an additional €246 million of synergies
compared to 2016. The integration of the two
corporate head offices into one Global Support
Office resulted in synergy savings of €31 million
during the year. In the United States, the creation
of Retail Business Services (RBS) – which enables
efficiencies in the back office and support
functions and builds retail expertise in own brand,
digital and IT – is progressing well. Our brands
in the U.S., The Netherlands and Belgium
harmonized their terms and conditions of both
goods for resale and goods not meant for resale.

In 2017, pro forma net sales were €22,894 million,
down by 1.8% or €422 million compared to 2016.
At constant exchange rates, pro forma net sales
were up by 0.1%.
Pro forma net sales growth was affected by higher
gasoline sales, due to an increase in gasoline
prices. Excluding gasoline, pro forma net sales
at constant rates were down 0.3% compared to
2016. The decrease was mainly driven by flat
comparable sales growth due to price deflation
in the first months of 2017 and the New York
market cycling competitive closures in the prior
year. At the end of the second quarter, Ahold USA
also announced new price investments in ownbrand products, produce, milk and eggs.
During the year, the Ahold USA brands
strengthened their digital capabilities,
investing in digital coupons, new websites,
mobile app improvements and a new recipe
center. Our online business, Peapod, continued
to invest in marketing its “Podpass” membership
that offers free delivery at a fixed fee, resulting in
more members subscribing. Podpass members
order more frequently and spend more in total
than other customers.

Pro forma operating income decreased by
€35 million, or 4.1%, to €819 million compared
to 2016. Underlying pro forma operating income
rose by €22 million and is adjusted for the following
items, which impacted operating income:
• Impairments: In 2017, impairment charges
amounted to €53 million, while in 2016 they
amounted to 32 million. The impairments in
2017 related primarily to underperforming stores
and the closure of bfresh locations. In 2016, they
primarily related to underperforming stores and
investment properties.
• (Gains) losses on the sale of assets:
No individually significant gains or losses were
recorded in 2017 or 2016.
• Restructuring and related charges and
other items: The 2017 charges increased by
€31 million compared to 2016. In 2017, these
charges mainly related to integration costs
as a result of the merger (€28 million) and the
set-up of the U.S. brand-centric organization
(€29 million). The 2017 integration costs
included a one-time €25 million benefit related
to an alignment of pension benefits at our U.S.
operations. In 2016, these charges mainly
related to integration costs as a result of the
merger (€33 million).
In 2017, pro forma underlying operating income
was €943 million, up by €22 million or 2.4%
compared to last year. At constant rates, pro forma
underlying operating income increased by 4.6%.
Ahold USA’s pro forma underlying operating
income margin in 2017 was 4.1%, up 0.1 percentage
points compared to 2016. Strong synergy savings
were partly offset by lower sales leverage due
to price deflation, price investments, increased
promotional spend and lower pharmacy margins.

On a pro forma basis, net sales in 2017 were
€15,395 million, down by 0.7%, or €106 million,
compared to 2016. At constant exchange rates,
sales were up by 1.3%. The increase was mainly
driven by comparable sales growth of 1.3%
and adversely impacted by the deflationary
environment in the first months of the year.
Sales growth at Food Lion was fueled by the
brand’s “Easy, Fresh & Affordable” strategy.
Food Lion relaunched 93 stores in the Greensboro
market area in August and 71 stores in the
Richmond market area in October after extensive
remodeling during the year. Previously launched
“Easy, Fresh & Affordable” stores in the North
Carolina markets of Charlotte, Wilmington,
Greenville and Raleigh continue to perform
according to plan.
During the year, Food Lion launched “Shop &
Earn,” a digital loyalty program offering customers
the opportunity to receive personalized savings
on the products and categories they shop the
most. The program has been well-received by
Food Lion’s customers and will be launched in
phases, with a full rollout in the first quarter of 2018.
In addition, Hannaford introduced a fully digital
loyalty program called “My Hannaford Rewards”
that offers new and personalized ways for
customers to save when they shop. The program
will be fully rolled out in January 2018.

Pro forma operating income was €550 million, up
19.8% or €91 million. Underlying operating income
is adjusted for the following items, which impacted
operating income:
• Impairments: Impairments amounted to
€2 million. No individually significant impairments
were recorded in 2017 or 2016.
• (Gains) losses on the sale of assets: No
individually significant gains or losses were
recorded in 2017 or 2016.
• Restructuring and related charges and other
items: 2017 charges of €41 million were mainly
related to integration costs of €42 million due to
the merger, €11 million related to the set-up of
the U.S. brand-centric organization and partly
offset by income from legal settlements. In 2016,
charges were mostly related to integration costs
of €37 million due to the merger. The charges
also included the settlement of the share-based
payment plan prior to the merger (€15 million)
and costs due to Hurricane Matthew in Q4
(€11 million).
On a pro forma basis, underlying operating
income in 2017 was €595 million, up by
€57 million compared to last year. At constant
rates, underlying operating income increased
by 13.2%. Delhaize America’s underlying
operating income margin in 2017 was 3.9%,
up 0.4 percentage points compared to 2016.
The increase reflects strong synergy savings as
well as “save for our customers” programs that
were partly offset by higher depreciation expenses
related to the rollout of “Easy, Fresh & Affordable”
investments at Food Lion, the purchase price
allocation, price investments and higher
labor costs.

On a pro forma basis, net sales in 2017 were
€13,672 million, up by 5.0% or €657 million
compared to 2016.
This increase was mainly driven by the 4.5%
growth in comparable sales and was fueled by
double-digit sales growth at our e-commerce
operations. During the year, Albert Heijn continued
making quality and assortment improvements to
its own-brand product lines. These improvements
were recognized externally with several “Best Buy”
awards. The brand’s attractive promotions were
also recognized externally for providing great value
for customers. Albert Heijn Online expanded the
availability of its subscription model to additional
geographical areas and opened a fourth “Home
Shop Center” to support its strong growth.

Albert Heijn also launched Appie Today, the
first supermarket online TV channel, during the
year. Appie Today is a new and innovative way to
connect with customers and colleagues by offering
daily shows on food, culture, trends and news.
For the full year, market share at Albert Heijn
increased to 35.3% (Source: Nielsen).
Bol.com delivered strong double-digit growth in
net consumer online sales of 28.8%. The business
in Belgium and the Plaza platform – which offers
a marketplace to merchant partners – remain
important growth drivers. In addition, customers
are shopping more often and for a wider range of
products. During the year, bol.com introduced the
“Select” subscription service for faster, lower-cost
delivery as well as an e-book subscription service.
In September, bol.com opened a new fulfillment
center, a more than €100 million investment, to
increase innovation and growth capacity and
ensure even more reliable delivery of e-commerce
orders in the Netherlands and Belgium.

Pro forma operating income increased by
€93 million, or 16.1%, to €671 million, affected
by the following items that Ahold Delhaize adjusts
for to arrive at underlying operating income:
• Impairments: The 2016 impairment
charges included an impairment charge
of €9 million for a write-down of prepaid
consideration for stores transferred back to
Jumbo (related to the transfer of stores from
Jumbo in 2012). The remaining impairment
charges in 2016 mainly related
to underperforming stores.
• (Gains) losses on the sale of assets: In 2017,
The Netherlands sold assets with an aggregate
gain of €17 million and in 2016 with an aggregate
loss of €2 million.
• Restructuring and related charges and other
items: In 2017, The Netherlands recorded
€9 million of integration costs and it also included
restructuring costs related to the closure of
stores in Germany. The charges in 2016 related
mainly to costs associated with a lump-sum
compensation for a reduction in benefits for
employees in the Netherlands (€28 million)
and integration costs (€4 million).

In 2017, pro forma underlying operating
income in The Netherlands was €674 million,
up by €45 million or 7.2% from €629 million in
2016. The underlying operating margin of The
Netherlands was 4.9% in 2017, up 0.1 percentage
points compared to 2016. Margins mainly
improved as a result of synergies realized from the
merger with the Delhaize Group and good cost
control; these were partly offset by higher pension
costs due to lower interest rates, and the higher
dilutive impact of our online businesses as a result
of their continued strong sales growth. Our online
businesses in the Netherlands operate at a lower
margin, so their accelerated growth has a dilutive
impact on the segment’s overall margin.
Excluding bol.com, the underlying operating
income margin was 5.6% in 2017, up by 0.2
percentage points compared to 2016.
Our net sales in The Netherlands consist of
sales to consumers and to franchise stores.
Franchise stores operate under the same
format as Ahold Delhaize-operated stores.
Franchisees purchase merchandise primarily
from Ahold Delhaize, pay a franchise fee and
receive support services, including management
training, field support and marketing and
administrative assistance.

On a pro forma basis, net sales in 2017
were €4,942 million, flat compared to 2016,
and comparable sales declined by 0.2%.
While performance in the affiliated network
and stores in Luxembourg was solid, comparable
sales growth in the company-operated stores
was negative, mainly driven by a lower basket
size. Delhaize.be, our online business in
Belgium, grew home delivery sales by 21%.
Customer satisfaction increased as a result of
higher product availability and on-time delivery
following further improvements in fulfillment
and logistics.
Our market share in Belgium for the year declined
to 23.8% from 24.1% last year (Source: Nielsen).
Delhaize celebrated its 150th anniversary,
highlighting its important Belgian heritage with
special promotions and offers. During the year,
92 company-owned and affiliated stores were
optimized. This included remodelings, extensions,
relocations and uplifts. In addition, the focus for
2017 was on strengthening the commercial plan,
increasing the impact of promotional activities and
improving the customer experience.

Pro forma operating income decreased by
€4 million compared to 2016 to €93 million.
Underlying operating income is adjusted for the
following items, which impacted operating income:
• Impairments: No individually significant gains
or losses were recorded in 2017 or 2016.
• (Gains) losses on the sale of assets: No
individually significant gains or losses were
recorded in 2017 or 2016.
• Restructuring and related charges and other
items: The charges in 2017 mainly related to
integration costs of €4 million and restructuring
costs of €12 million. In 2016, charges mainly
related to integration costs of €7 million and
restructuring costs of €7 million.
On a pro forma basis, underlying operating
income in 2017 was €110 million, down by
9.1%, or €11 million, compared to last year.
Underlying operating income margin in 2017
was 2.2, down 0.2 percentage points compared
to 2016. Underlying operating income was lower,
mainly because synergy savings were more
than offset by an increased level of promotional
activities, higher shrinkage in company-owned
stores and higher logistic costs.
Our net sales in Belgium consist of sales to
consumers and to affiliate stores. Affiliates receive
goods at a wholesale price that includes a markup on our purchase price.

In 2017, net sales on a pro forma basis in Central
and Southeastern Europe (CSE) were €5,791
million, up by 4.2% or €234 million compared to
2016. At constant exchange rates, net sales were
up by 3.4%.

Serbia also expanded its store network by opening
11 new stores, a total of 414 stores at the end of the
year. In addition, the brand invested in remodeling
and upgrading 35 stores to further strengthen
its portfolio.

Sales growth was driven by comparable sales
growth of 0.9% and by the net addition of 112
stores in 2017, which contributed 2.5% to sales
growth. Comparable sales growth was driven
by our businesses in the Czech Republic,
Romania and Serbia, while Greece saw its
comparable sales growth decline as a result
of the normalization of market circumstances,
which had been impacted by competitive
disruptions during the last two years. Our Greek
brand expanded its store network by 34 stores,
operating a total of 412 at the end of the year.
Alfa Beta also started piloting digital personalized
communication with its AB Plus loyalty scheme.

Pro forma operating income increased by
€21 million compared to 2016, to €236 million.
Underlying operating income is adjusted for the
following items, which impacted operating income:

In the Czech Republic, Albert invested in
remodeling and upgrading 70 stores to further
optimize its supermarket portfolio. The brand also
strengthened its logistics network by opening
a third distribution center.
Mega Image, our brand in Romania, expanded
to a new geographical area and, at the start
of the second quarter, opened its first store in
Cluj-Napoca, one of Romania’s largest cities, in
the heart of Transylvania. Mega Image operated
595 stores at year-end. In November, the brand
launched its own online store providing customers
in the Bucharest area with home delivery and instore pickup.

• Impairments: No individually significant gains
or losses were recorded in 2017 or 2016.
• (Gains) losses on the sale of assets: No
individually significant gains or losses were
recorded in 2017 or 2016.
• Restructuring and related charges and other
items: No individually significant charges were
recorded in 2017 or 2016.
2017 pro forma underlying operating income in
CSE was €242 million, up by €11 million or 4.8%
from €231 million in 2016. Pro forma underlying
operating income margin was 4.2%, which was flat
versus 2016. The Czech Republic, Romania and
Serbia reported higher margins, while Greece’s
margin decreased, due to sales deleverage.

Earnings and dividend per share

Income from continuing operations per common
share (basic) was €1.45, an increase of €0.64 or
79.0% compared to 2016. The main drivers of
this increase were the higher operating income
(€641 million), in part because, as in 2016 only the
post–merger income from the former Delhaize
operations was taken into account, the tax rate
changes due to local tax reforms (€407 million) and
the one-off finance cost (€246 million) incurred in
2016. In addition, the weighted average number
of common shares increased from 1,022 million
in 2016 to 1,251 million in 2017 as a result of
shares issued to effect the merger, partially
offset by a €1 billion share buyback executed
during 2017 (see Note 20 to the consolidated
financial statements for more information on the
share movements) and the full-year impact of the
€1 billion capital repayment and reverse stock
split transaction executed in 2016.

The increase in the weighted average number of

compensation programs.
Pro forma income from continuing operations
per common share (basic) was €1.46, an increase
of €0.61 or 72% compared to 2016. This increase
was driven by higher income from continuing
operations of €750 million.
Our dividend policy is to target a payout ratio in
the range of 40-50% of underlying income from
continuing operations (on a pro forma basis).
As part of our dividend policy, we adjust income
from continuing operations for impairments of
non-current assets, gains and losses on the sale
of assets, restructuring and related charges,
and other unusual items. Pro forma underlying
income from continuing operations amounted to
€1,582 million and €1,486 million in 2017 and 2016,
respectively, and was determined as follows:

Delhaize Belgium’s deferred tax positions, applying the reduced U.S. and Belgian corporate income tax rates; see Note 10

Reflecting the confidence we have in our strategy
and our ability to generate cash, we propose a
cash dividend of €0.63 per common share for
the financial year 2017, up 10.5% from last year.
This reflects our ambition to sustainably grow the
dividend per share and represents a payout ratio
of 47%, based on the expected dividend payment
on pro forma underlying income from continuing
operations, which is in line with our dividend policy.

Property, plant and equipment decreased by
€1,081 million, primarily due to the the weakening
of the U.S. dollar against the euro, while capital
expenditures were offset by depreciation and
impairments. Intangible assets decreased by
€913 million, primarily due to the weakening
of the U.S. dollar against the euro.
Group equity decreased by €1,106 million.
This decrease was mainly driven by the
completion of the €1 billion share buyback and
the 2017 dividend of €720 million and a negative
currency translation impact of €1,309 million.
This was partially offset by the current year’s
net income.

the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the euro,
and regular payments on finance lease and
financing transaction liabilities. This was partially
offset by the issuance of the €750 million bond.

Our defined benefit plans showed a net deficit
of €567 million at year-end 2017 compared
to a net deficit of €659 million at year-end 2016.
This decrease was the result of a weakening
of the U.S. dollar (€45 million), €33 million of
actuarial remeasurements, and €14 million
of excess contributions over annual expenses.

Ahold Delhaize’s net debt was €2,503 million as
of December 31, 2017 – a decrease of €741 million
from January 1, 2017. The decrease in gross
debt (€311 million) and our strong free cash flow
generation (€1,926 million), were mainly offset by
the completion of the €1 billion share buyback and
payment of common stock dividend (€720 million).

A significant number of union employees in the
United States are covered by multi-employer
plans. With the help of external actuaries, we have
updated the most recent available information
that these plans have provided (generally as of
January 1, 2016) for market trends and conditions
through the end of 2017. We estimate our
proportionate share of the total net deficit to be
$912 million (€760 million) at year-end 2017 (2016:
$910 million or €865 million). These amounts are
not recognized on our balance sheet. While this
is our best estimate based on the information
available to us, it is imprecise and not necessarily
reliable. For more information see Note 23 to the
consolidated financial statements.

Net debt does not include our contractual
commitments under operating lease
contracts, which, on an undiscounted basis,
amounted to €7,590 million at year-end 2017
(2016: €8,450 million). The off-balance sheet
operating lease commitments impact our
capital structure.

Liquidity and cash flows

Liquidity
Ahold Delhaize views available cash balances
and funds from operating activities as its primary
sources of liquidity, complemented with access
to external sources of funds when deemed to be
required. Ahold Delhaize manages short-term
liquidity based on projected cash flows. As of
December 31, 2017, the Company’s liquidity
position primarily consisted of €3,380 million of
cash (including short-term deposits and similar
instruments and current portion of assets available
for sale, adjusted for cash held under a notional
cash pooling arrangement), and the undrawn
portion of the €1 billion revolving credit facility.
Based on the current operating performance and
liquidity position, the Company believes that cash
provided by operating activities and available
cash balances will be sufficient for working capital,
capital expenditures, interest payments, dividends,
the announced €2 billion share buyback program,
and scheduled debt repayments for the next
12 months and the foreseeable future. In addition,
the Company has access to the amount available
on its revolving credit facility and to the debt
capital market on its current credit ratings.

Group credit facility
Ahold Delhaize has access to a €1.0 billion
committed, unsecured, multi-currency and
syndicated credit facility that was amended
and extended in February 2015, whereby the
Company reduced the size of the credit facility
from €1.2 billion to €1.0 billion (providing for the
issuance of $275 million in letters of credit). At the
same time, the facility was extended to 2020 with
two potential extensions after 12 and 24 months
that would take the facility to 2021 and 2022
respectively. The Company successfully agreed
both extensions with the lenders.
The credit facility contains customary covenants
and is subject to a financial covenant that requires
Ahold Delhaize, in the event that its corporate
rating from Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s is
lower than BBB / Baa2, respectively, not to exceed
a maximum leverage ratio of 4.0:1. During 2016
and 2017, the Company was in compliance with
these covenants. As of December 31, 2017, there
were no outstanding borrowings under the facility
other than letters of credit to an aggregate amount
of $156 million (€130 million).

Credit ratings
Maintaining investment grade credit ratings is a
cornerstone of Ahold Delhaize’s strategy because
such ratings serve to lower the cost of funds
and facilitate access to a variety of lenders and
markets. Ahold Delhaize’s current credit ratings
from the solicited rating agencies are as follows:
• Standard & Poor’s: corporate credit rating BBB,
with a stable outlook as of June 2009 (previous
rating BBB- assigned in 2007).
• Moody’s: issuer credit rating Baa1, with a stable
outlook as of February 2018 (previous rating
Baa2 assigned in August 2015).

common shares were repurchased under this
program in 2017.
• Common stock dividend at €0.57 per share
resulting in a cash outflow of €720 million.

Ahold Delhaize Annual Report 2017

Definitions – performance measures
The financial information included
in this Annual Report is prepared
in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards
as adopted by the European
Union, as explained in Note 2
Basis of preparation and Note 3
Significant accounting policies
to the consolidated financial
statements, unless otherwise
indicated.
The definitions of non-financial performance
measures included in the Annual Report can
be found in the Sustainability performance –
Definitions section.

This Annual Report also includes alternative
performance measures (also known as non-GAAP
measures). The definitions of these alternative
performance measures can be found below.
Management believes that these alternative
performance (non-GAAP) financial measures
allow for a better understanding of Ahold
Delhaize’s operating and financial performance.
These alternative performance measures should
be considered in addition to, but not as substitutes
for, the most directly comparable IFRS measures.

Comparable sales
Comparable sales are net sales, in local currency,
from exactly the same stores and online sales
in existing market areas for the most recent
comparable period plus net sales from stores
that are replaced within the same market area.
For markets that sell gasoline, Ahold Delhaize
also calculates the comparable sales, excluding
gasoline sales, to eliminate gasoline price volatility
in the comparison. Ahold Delhaize measures a
store for comparable sales after being open for
a full 56 weeks.
Comparable sales and comparable sales
excluding gasoline sales are not reflected in
Ahold Delhaize’s financial statements. However,
the Company believes that disclosing comparable
sales and comparable sales excluding gasoline
sales provides additional useful analytical
information to investors regarding the operating
performance of Ahold Delhaize as it neutralizes
the impact of, for example, newly acquired stores
in the calculation of sales growth.

Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization, or EBITDA
Ahold Delhaize defines EBITDA as operating
income / (loss) plus depreciation and amortization.
EBITDA is considered to be a useful measure for
investors to analyze profitability by eliminating
the effects of financing (i.e., net financial
expense), capital investments and the impact of
the purchase price allocation (i.e., depreciation
and amortization).
Free cash flow
Ahold Delhaize defines free cash flow as operating
cash flows from continuing operations minus net
capital expenditures and net interest paid plus
dividends received. Ahold Delhaize has included
free cash flow as the Company believes it is a
useful measure for investors, because it provides
insight into the cash flows available to, among
other things, reduce debt and pay dividends.
Free cash flow is derived from the financial
statements; however, this is not a measure
calculated in accordance with IFRS and may not
be comparable to similar measures presented
by other companies. Accordingly, free cash flow
should not be considered as an alternative to
operating cash flow.

Global Support Office costs
Global Support Office (GSO) costs relate
to the responsibilities of the Global Support
Office, including Finance, Strategy, Mergers
& Acquisitions, Internal Audit, Legal & Compliance,
Human Resources, Information Technology,
Insurance, Tax, Treasury, Communications,
Investor Relations, Sustainable Retailing,
and the majority of the Executive Committee.
Global Support Office costs also include results
from other activities coordinated centrally but not
allocated to any subsidiary. Underlying Global
Support Office costs exclude impairments of
non-current assets, gains and losses on the sale
of assets, and restructuring and related charges
and other items, including business acquisition
transaction costs.
Gross rent
Gross rent comprises all of the rent that Ahold
Delhaize is required to pay to third parties and is
not corrected for rental income Ahold Delhaize
receives from other third parties.
Net consumer online sales
Total online sales to customers, excluding sales
taxes and value-added taxes, but including
sales of third parties via bol.com’s Plaza.
Ahold Delhaize’s management believes that this
measure provides more insight into the growth
of our online businesses.

Definitions – performance measures

Net debt
Net debt is the difference between (i) the sum of
loans, finance lease liabilities, cumulative preferred
financing shares and short-term debt (i.e., gross
debt) and (ii) cash, cash equivalents, current
portion of available-for-sale financial assets,
and short-term deposits and similar instruments.
In management’s view, because cash, cash
equivalents, current portion of available-for-sale
financial assets, and short-term deposits and
similar instruments can be used, among other
things, to repay indebtedness, netting this against
gross debt is a useful measure for investors to
judge Ahold Delhaize’s leverage. Net debt may
include certain cash items that are not readily
available for repaying debt.
Net sales at constant exchange rates
Net sales at constant exchange rates exclude
the impact of using different currency exchange
rates to translate the financial information of
Ahold Delhaize subsidiaries or joint ventures to
euros. Ahold Delhaize’s management believes
this measure provides a better insight into the
operating performance of Ahold Delhaize’s

Pro forma
Ahold Delhaize defines the pro forma information
as the combined results of Ahold and Delhaize
in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the
International Accounting Standards Board (IASB)
and as adopted by the European Union (EU).
These combined results are adjusted for:
• Exclusion of the performance of remedy stores

(PPA) effects
• Alignment of Global Support Office functions
and related costs
• Alignment of foreign exchange rates used

Return on capital
Return on Capital (RoC) is calculated as
Underlying Operating Income before Depreciation,
Amortization and Rent Expense divided by the
annual rolling average of the sum of Property,
Plant and Equipment at purchase price, Intangible
assets at purchase price, Operating Working
Capital components and Rent Expense, divided
by 8%.
Total shareholder return
Total shareholder return (TSR) is the sum of the
change in share price and dividends paid to show
the total return to the shareholder expressed as an
annualized percentage.
Underlying operating income
and margin
Total operating income, adjusted for impairments
of non-current assets, gains and losses on the
sale of assets, restructuring and related charges,
and other items considered not to be directly
related to the underlying operating performance.
Ahold Delhaize’s management believes this

is calculated as underlying operating income as
a percentage of net sales.

Underlying income from
continuing operations

continuing operations as income from continuing
operations adjusted for impairments of non-current
assets, gains and losses on the sale of assets,
restructuring and related charges, and other
items considered not to be directly related to the
underlying operating performance, as well as
material non-recurring finance costs and income
tax expense, and the potential effect of income tax
on all these items.
Underlying income per share
from continuing operations
Underlying income per share from continuing
operations is calculated as underlying income
from continuing operations, divided by the
weighted average number of shares outstanding.
Underlying earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization,
or underlying EBITDA and margin
Ahold Delhaize defines underlying EBITDA as
underlying operating income plus depreciation
and amortization. Underlying EBITDA is
considered to be a useful measure for investors
to analyze profitability by eliminating the effects
of financing (i.e., net financial expense), capital
investments and the impact of the purchase price
allocation (i.e., depreciation and amortization).
Underlying EBITDA margin is calculated as
underlying EBITDA as a percentage of net sales.

Composition of the Management Board
and Executive Committee
According to our Articles of Association, the
Management Board must consist of at least three
members. The current members are: Dick Boer,
President and Chief Executive Officer; Frans
Muller, Deputy Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Integration Officer; Jeff Carr, Chief Financial
Officer; and Kevin Holt, Chief Executive Officer
Ahold Delhaize USA1. The current members of
the Executive Committee are the members of the
Management Board along with Wouter Kolk, Chief
Operating Officer the Netherlands and Belgium;
Abbe Luersman, Chief Human Resources Officer;
Jan Ernst de Groot, Chief Legal Officer; Marc
Croonen, Chief Sustainability, Transformation
and Communications Officer; and Ben Wishart1,
Global Chief Information Officer.
On January 1, 2018, Pierre Bouchut stepped
down from the Management Board and Executive
Committee. He will remain available as an adviser
and for specific initiatives until July 1, 2018. As of
January 1, 2018, Ben Wishart became a member
of the Executive Committee. On April 11, 2018,
at the annual General Meeting of Shareholders,
Wouter Kolk will be nominated for appointment to
the Management Board.
At Ahold Delhaize, we believe that a diverse and
fully representative Management Board and
Executive Committee contributes to well-balanced
decision-making processes and the optimal
functioning of both the Management Board and
the Executive Committee. In accordance with
provision 2.1.5 of the Dutch Corporate Governance
Code, Ahold Delhaize’s diversity policy states
that the composition of the Executive Committee
1 Effective January 1, 2018.

and the Management Board and the combined
experience and expertise of their members
should reflect the profile of the Company as it
relates to nationality, age, education, gender and
professional background. This aim for the best
fit, in combination with the availability of qualified
candidates, has resulted in Ahold Delhaize, as of
February 27, 2018, having a Management Board in
which all four members are male and an Executive
Committee in which one member is female and
eight members are male. We seek to identify
potential Board members who would enhance the
diversity of the Boards in the above-mentioned
areas. In order to meet our diversity ambitions
and comply with statutory guidelines for gender
diversity in the coming years, we continue to
work to ensure we build robust development and
succession plans; generate diverse, balanced
slates; and take the necessary actions to retain
our current diverse talents so we can build our
talent pipeline and drive greater diversity at all
levels in our organization.
Appointment, suspension and dismissal
The General Meeting of Shareholders can appoint,
suspend or dismiss a Management Board
member by an absolute majority of votes cast,
upon a proposal made by the Supervisory Board.
If another party makes the proposal, an absolute
majority of votes cast, representing at least onethird of the issued share capital, is required. If this
qualified majority is not achieved, but an absolute
majority of the votes exercised was in favor of the
proposal, then a second meeting may be held.
In the second meeting, only an absolute majority
of votes exercised, regardless of the number of
shares represented at the meeting, is required to
adopt the proposal.

Management Board members are appointed
for four-year terms and may be reappointed
for additional terms not exceeding four years.
The Supervisory Board may at any time suspend
a Management Board member and Executive
Committee member. The other members of the
Executive Committee are appointed, suspended
and dismissed by the Supervisory Board, at the
proposal of the CEO.
Remuneration
On April 19, 2016, Ahold Delhaize’s General
Meeting of Shareholders adopted our current
remuneration policy for Management Board
members. On April 12, 2017, Ahold Delhaize’s
General Meeting of Shareholders adopted an
individual exception to this policy. You can find

Evaluation
The Management Board and the Executive
Committee conducted a self-assessment by
means of a structured dialogue chaired by the
CEO. Items that were assessed and discussed
included the composition of the Boards, meeting
processes and procedures, discussions and
decision-making, and team dynamics.

Supervisory Board

The Supervisory Board is responsible for
supervising and advising our Management Board
and overseeing the general course of affairs,
strategy, operational performance and corporate
governance of the Company. The Supervisory
Board is guided in its duties by the interests of the
Company and the enterprise connected with the
Company, taking into consideration the overall
good of the enterprise and the relevant interests
of all its stakeholders. The Supervisory Board
is responsible for monitoring and assessing its
own performance.
Ahold Delhaize’s Articles of Association require
the approval of the Supervisory Board for certain
major resolutions proposed to be taken by the
Management Board, including:
• Issuance of shares
• Acquisitions, redemptions, repurchases
of shares, and any reduction in issued
and outstanding capital
• Allocation of duties within the Management
Board and the adoption or amendment of the
Rules of Procedure of the Management Board
and the Executive Committee
• Significant changes in the identity or the nature
of the Company or its enterprise
Presidium
Following the merger between Ahold and
Delhaize, a Presidium was introduced that meets
on a monthly basis with the Chief Executive Officer
and the Deputy Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Integration Officer. The Presidium is composed

Supervisory Board, Mats Jansson and Jan
Hommen. Its main task is to prepare the agenda of
Supervisory Board meetings, deal with the content
of Supervisory Board meetings and to stay in close
contact with the CEO and Deputy CEO.
More detailed information on the Supervisory
Board can be found in the Supervisory Board
report. The Rules of Procedure of the Supervisory
Board are available in the Governance
section of Ahold Delhaize’s public website
at www.aholddelhaize.com.
Appointment
The General Meeting of Shareholders can
appoint, suspend or dismiss a Supervisory Board
member by an absolute majority of votes cast,
upon a proposal made by the Supervisory Board.
If another party makes the proposal, an absolute
majority of votes cast, representing at least onethird of the issued share capital, is required. If this
qualified majority is not achieved but an absolute
majority of the votes exercised was in favor of the
proposal, then a second meeting may be held.
In the second meeting, only an absolute majority
of votes exercised, regardless of the number of
shares represented at the meeting, is required.
A Supervisory Board member is appointed for a
four-year term and may be reappointed for another
four-year period. The Supervisory Board member
may subsequently be reappointed again for a
period of two years, which may be extended by,
at most, two years.

Conflict of interest
Each member of the Supervisory Board is
required to immediately report any potential
conflict of interest to the Chairman of the
Supervisory Board and provide all relevant
information. In the event of a potential conflict
of interest, each member of the Management
Board is required to immediately report this to
the Chairman of the Supervisory Board and
to the other members of the Management Board
and provide them with all relevant information.
Should a conflict of interest arise, the Supervisory
Board or the relevant Management Board
member may not participate in the discussions
and decision-making process on subjects or
transactions relating to the conflict of interest.
We will record any such transactions in the
annual report for the relevant year, with reference
to the conflict of interest and a confirmation that
we have complied with best practice provisions
2.7.3 and 2.7.4 of the Dutch Corporate Governance
Code. During 2017, no member of the Supervisory
Board or the Management Board had a conflict
of interest that was of material significance to
the Company.
In addition, no transactions between the
Company and legal or natural persons who
hold at least 10% of the shares in the Company
occurred in 2017, corresponding to the best
practice provision 2.7.5 of the Code.

Shares and shareholders’ rights

General Meeting of Shareholders
Ahold Delhaize’s shareholders exercise their
rights through annual and extraordinary General
Meetings of Shareholders. We are required
to convene an annual General Meeting of
Shareholders in the Netherlands each year,
no later than six months after the end of the
Company’s financial year. Additional extraordinary
General Meetings of Shareholders may be
convened at any time by the Supervisory Board,
the Management Board, or by one or more
shareholders representing at least 10% of the
issued share capital.
The agenda for the annual General Meeting
of Shareholders must contain certain matters
as specified in Ahold Delhaize’s Articles of
Association and under Dutch law, including the
adoption of our annual financial statements.
The General Meeting of Shareholders is also
entitled to vote on important decisions regarding
Ahold Delhaize’s identity or character, including
major acquisitions and divestments.
Shareholders are entitled to propose items for
the agenda of the annual General Meeting of
Shareholders provided that they hold at least
1% of the issued share capital or the shares that
they hold represent a market value of at least
€50 million. Proposals for agenda items for the
annual General Meeting of Shareholders must
be submitted at least 60 days prior to the date
of the meeting.

Adoption of resolutions
Subject to certain exceptions provided by Dutch
law or our Articles of Association, resolutions
are passed by an absolute majority of votes cast
without a requirement for a quorum.
Proposals submitted to the agenda by
shareholders require an absolute majority
of votes cast at the annual General Meeting
of Shareholders representing at least one-third
of the issued shares. If this qualified majority
is not achieved but an absolute majority of the
votes exercised was in favor of the proposal,
then a second meeting may be held. In the
second meeting, only an absolute majority of
votes exercised is required to adopt the proposal,
regardless of the number of shares represented
at the meeting (unless the law or our Articles
of Association provide otherwise).
A resolution to amend the Articles of Association
that would change the rights vested in the holders
of a particular class of shares requires the prior
approval of a meeting of that particular class.
A resolution to dissolve the Company may
be adopted by the annual General Meeting
of Shareholders following a proposal of the
Management Board made with the approval of
the Supervisory Board. Any proposed resolution
to wind up the Company must be disclosed in
the notice calling the annual General Meeting
of Shareholders at which that proposal is to
be considered.

Voting rights
Each common share entitles its holder to cast one
vote. Dutch law prescribes a record date to be
set 28 days prior to the date of the annual General
Meeting of Shareholders to determine whether a
person may attend and exercise the rights relating
to the annual General Meeting of Shareholders.
Shareholders registered at that date are entitled to
attend and to exercise their rights as shareholders
in relation to the annual General Meeting of
Shareholders, regardless of a sale of shares after
the record date. Shareholders may be represented
by written proxy.
We encourage participation in our General
Meetings of Shareholders. We use Deutsche
Bank Trust Company Americas, the Depositary
for the Company’s American Depositary Receipt
(ADR) facility, to enable ADR holders to exercise
their voting rights, which are represented by the
common shares underlying the ADRs.
Neither Ahold Delhaize nor any of its subsidiaries
may cast a vote on any share they hold in the
Company. These shares are not taken into
account for the purpose of determining how many
shareholders are represented or how much of
the share capital is represented at the General
Meeting of Shareholders.
Holders of depositary receipts of cumulative
preferred financing shares may attend the
General Meeting of Shareholders. The voting
rights on the underlying shares may be exercised
by the Stichting Administratiekantoor Preferente
Financierings Aandelen Ahold (SAPFAA),
a foundation organized under the laws of
the Netherlands.

Cumulative preferred financing shares
All outstanding cumulative preferred financing
shares have been issued to SAPFAA. Holders
of depositary receipts can obtain proxies
from SAPFAA.
In accordance with its articles, the board of
SAPFAA consists of three members: one A
member, one B member and one C member.
The A member is appointed by the general
meeting of depositary receipt holders, the B
member is appointed by the Company and the C
member is appointed by a joint resolution of the
A member and the B member. As of February 27,
2018, the members of the board of SAPFAA are:
Member A:
Member B:
Member C:

J.L. van der Giessen
C.W. de Monchy
R. ter Haar, chairman

Ahold Delhaize pays a mandatory annual dividend
on cumulative preferred financing shares, which
is calculated in accordance with the provisions
of article 39.4 of the Company’s Articles of
Association. For further details on cumulative
preferred financing shares and the related
voting rights, see Note 22 to the consolidated
financial statements.

Cumulative preferred shares
As of February 27, 2018, no cumulative preferred
shares are outstanding. In March 1989, the
Company entered into an agreement with the
Dutch foundation Stichting Continuïteit Ahold
Delhaize (SCAD, previously named Stichting
Ahold Continuïteit), as amended and restated
in April 1994, March 1997, December 2001,
and December 2003 (the Option Agreement).
The Option Agreement was designed to, in
accordance with the purpose of SCAD under its
articles, potentially exercise influence in the event
of a public offer or a potential change of control
over the Company, to safeguard the interests
of the Company and all stakeholders in the
Company and to potentially avert, to the best of
its ability, influences that might conflict with those
interests by affecting the Company’s continuity,
independence or identity.
Pursuant to the Option Agreement, SCAD has
been granted an option for no consideration
to acquire cumulative preferred shares from
the Company from time to time until December
2018. The Option Agreement provides for the
possibility of extension by both parties’ consent.
At Ahold Delhaize, a decision to extend the Option
Agreement is at the discretion of the Management
Board, subject to the approval of the Supervisory
Board. In December 2017, the Company and
SCAD commenced discussions on a possible
extension of the Option Agreement, in accordance
with its terms which require such discussions to
start at least one year prior to the expiration date.
No conclusion has been reached at this time.

SCAD and the members of its board are
independent from the Company. As of February
27, 2018, the members of the board of SCAD are:

preferred shares, see Note 20 to the consolidated
financial statements. The related documents are
available on our website www.aholddelhaize.com.
Issuance of additional shares
and preemptive rights
Shares may be issued following a resolution by the
General Meeting of Shareholders on a proposal
of the Management Board made with the approval
of the Supervisory Board. The General Meeting
of Shareholders may resolve to delegate this
authority to the Management Board for a period
of time not exceeding five years. A resolution of the
General Meeting of Shareholders to issue shares,
or to authorize the Management Board to do so,
is also subject to the approval of each class of
shares whose rights would be adversely affected
by the proposed issuance or delegation. On April
12, 2017, the General Meeting of Shareholders
approved a delegation of this authority to the
Management Board, relating to the issuance and
/ or granting of rights to acquire common shares
up to a maximum of 10% of the issued common
shares through October 12, 2018, and subject to
the approval of the Supervisory Board.

Upon the issuance of new common shares,
holders of Ahold Delhaize’s common shares
have a preemptive right to subscribe to common
shares in proportion to the total amount of their
existing holdings of Ahold Delhaize’s common
shares. According to the Company’s Articles of
Association, this preemptive right does not apply
to any issuance of shares to Ahold Delhaize
associates. The General Meeting of Shareholders
may decide to restrict or exclude preemptive
rights. The General Meeting of Shareholders
may also resolve to designate the Management
Board as the corporate body authorized to restrict
or exclude preemptive rights for a period not
exceeding five years.
On April 12, 2017, the General Meeting of
Shareholders delegated to the Management
Board, subject to the approval of the Supervisory
Board, the authority to restrict or exclude the
preemptive rights of holders of common shares
upon the issuance of common shares and /
or upon the granting of rights to subscribe for
common shares through October 12, 2018.
Repurchase by Ahold Delhaize of its
own shares
Ahold Delhaize may only acquire fully paid shares
of any class in its capital for a consideration
following authorization by the General Meeting
of Shareholders and subject to certain provisions
of Dutch law and the Company’s Articles
of Association, if:

1. Shareholders’ equity minus the payment
required to make the acquisition is not less
than the sum of paid-in and called-up capital
and any reserves required by Dutch law or
Ahold Delhaize’s Articles of Association; and
2. Ahold Delhaize and its subsidiaries would
not, as a result, hold a number of shares
exceeding a total nominal value of 10% of
the issued share capital.
The Management Board has been authorized
to acquire a number of common shares in the
Company or depositary receipts for shares, as
permitted within the limits of the law and the
Articles of Association and subject to the approval
of the Supervisory Board. Such acquisition of
shares, at the stock exchange or otherwise, will
take place at a price between par value and 110%
of the opening price of the shares at Euronext
Amsterdam by NYSE Euronext on the date of their
acquisition. The authorization takes into account
the possibility to cancel the repurchased shares.
This authorization is valid through October 19,
2018. Ahold Delhaize may acquire shares in its
capital for no consideration or for the purpose
of transferring these shares to associates
through share plans or option plans, without such
authorization. The share buyback program of
€1 billion that started on January 9, 2017, was
successfully completed on December 29, 2017.
In total, 55,166,939 of the Company’s own shares
were repurchased at an average price of €18.13
per share. On January 2, 2018, the Company
commenced the €2 billion share buyback program
that was announced on November 8, 2017.
The program is expected to be completed before
the end of 2018.

Major shareholders
Ahold Delhaize is not directly or indirectly owned
or controlled by another corporation or by any
government. The Company does not know of any
arrangements that may, at a subsequent date,
result in a change of control, except as described
under Cumulative preferred shares.
Significant ownership of voting shares
According to the Dutch Financial Markets
Supervision Act, any person or legal entity who,
directly or indirectly, acquires or disposes of
an interest in Ahold Delhaize’s capital or voting
rights must immediately give written notice to the
Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets
(Autoriteit Financiële Markten or AFM) if the
acquisition or disposal causes the percentage of
outstanding capital interest or voting rights held by
that person or legal entity to reach, exceed or fall
below any of the following thresholds:
3%
25%
75%

5%
30%
95%

10%
40%

15%
50%

20%

referred to above changes as a result of a change
in Ahold Delhaize’s total outstanding capital or
voting rights. In addition, local rules may apply
to investors.

Supervisory Board report
Dear shareholder,
I am pleased to present our Supervisory Board

Board and oversee the activities and
performance of the Company for the benefit
of all our stakeholders.
The Board put particular focus on delivering
the synergies we committed to at the time of the

on the Better Together strategy. During 2017,
the Management Board provided us with
detailed information on the performance of the
business as well as strategic and operational

thoroughly reviewed, discussed and approved
the strategic options presented to us by the
Management Board.
We also focused on supporting the
Management Board in delivering a solid set of
full year results and are pleased to report that
Ahold Delhaize is on track with its integration
and fulfilling its synergy targets. You can find
more details on our 2017 focus areas and

On behalf of the Supervisory Board,
Mats Jansson

The Supervisory Board operates
independently and is responsible
for supervising and advising our
Management Board as well as
overseeing the general course of
affairs, long-term strategy and
operational performance of the
Company. The Supervisory Board is
guided in its duties by the interests
of the Company and the enterprise
connected with the Company, taking
into consideration the overall good
of the enterprise and the relevant
interests of all its stakeholders.

Composition of the Supervisory
Board

Ahold Delhaize’s Supervisory Board determines
the number of its members. The Supervisory
Board profile is published on Ahold Delhaize’s
public website at www.aholddelhaize.com
and is updated regularly.
In accordance with provision 2.1.5 of the Dutch
Corporate Governance Code, Ahold Delhaize’s
diversity policy states that the composition of the
Supervisory Board and the combined experience
and expertise of its members should reflect the
profile of the Company as it relates to nationality,
age, education, gender and professional
background. In addition, the composition of
the Board, including its members’ combined
experience, expertise and independence should
reflect the best fit for Ahold Delhaize’s profile and
strategy. This aim for the best fit, in combination
with the availability of qualified candidates, has
resulted in Ahold Delhaize currently having a
Supervisory Board in which two members are
female and 10 members are male. In order to
meet our diversity ambitions and comply with
statutory guidelines for gender diversity in the
coming years, we pay close attention to gender
diversity in selection process for new Supervisory
Board members.

Rules of Procedure
The Rules of Procedure of the Supervisory Board
state that if a member is concurrently a member of
another company’s supervisory board, the main
duties arising from and / or the number and nature
of any other supervisory board memberships
must not conflict or interfere with that individual’s
duties as a member of Ahold Delhaize’s
Supervisory Board.
Appointment
At the annual General Meeting of Shareholders
on April 12, 2017, Jan Hommen was reappointed
for his second four-year term and Ben Noteboom

Ongoing education
New members of our Supervisory Board attend a

Global Support Office in Zaandam. During the
onboarding program, new Supervisory Board
members are briefed on their responsibilities and

social, corporate responsibility, human resources,
governance, legal and reporting affairs of our
Company and its businesses. Throughout the year,
all members of our Supervisory Board visit several

the Company to gain greater familiarity with senior
management and to develop deeper knowledge
of local operations, opportunities and challenges
of the business. In addition, multiple in-depth
workshops are held on various topics to allow
the Supervisory Board members to gain greater
insight into key priorities of Ahold Delhaize.

Evaluation
The Supervisory Board conducted a selfassessment in early 2018. The Board assessed the
performance of its committees and its individual
members, as well as the performance of the
Management Board and its individual members,
during a private meeting. The Supervisory Board
was positive, overall, about the performance
of its committees, the Management Board and
satisfied with the performance of the Supervisory
Board. The Board determined that it has made
good progress in its continuous development as
a team, has a balanced composition that suits
the Company in its current stage and works well
together in an open atmosphere. As part of the
outcome of the assessment, the Supervisory
Board will keep a continuous focus on its own size
and structure in order to comply with the highest
standards of excellence and governance.

Remuneration
Dear shareholder,

Bill McEwan

Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
of the Supervisory Board

I am pleased to present our 2017 Remuneration
report. As one of the world’s leading food retail
groups, Ahold Delhaize employs 369,000
associates in nine countries. In determining the
employment conditions of our associates, we
set compensation and benefits levels in line with
associates’ job level and local market practices.
The remuneration practices in each of our local
markets are regularly reviewed to take into
account the market dynamics and economic
conditions. We are committed to the key principle
of fair and equitable treatment of all associates
as we determine remuneration policies. We apply
the same principles in the determination of the
Remuneration Policy for the Management Board.
As outlined in our Remuneration Policy,
Management Board remuneration is targeted
at or near the median of the labor market peer
group, consisting of six AEX, six European,
and six U.S. peer companies. During the past
year, the Management Board’s remuneration
was implemented in accordance with our
Remuneration Policy. This policy is in compliance
with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code
and was adopted at the annual General Meeting
of Shareholders on April 19, 2016. It became
effective on July 24, 2016, the first calendar
day after the merger of Ahold and Delhaize
was finalized. An individual exception to the
remuneration policy for the CEO Ahold Delhaize
USA (former Chief Operating Officer Ahold USA)
was adopted at the annual General Meeting of
Shareholders on April 12, 2017.

For the majority of our associates, remuneration
is based on collective bargaining agreements
structured primarily as fixed annual salaries or
hourly wages. In addition, store managers and
general management associates are eligible to
receive an annual performance-based bonus.
Associates in senior management positions are
eligible for performance-based annual bonuses
as well as Ahold Delhaize performance share
grants that are linked to the long-term goals of
the Company.
The Supervisory Board’s Remuneration
Committee closely monitors developments in
the global, regional and local labor markets and
takes these developments into account when
making recommendations on the Management
Board compensation to the Supervisory Board
for consideration and approval.
The following table shows the pay ratio of the
Chief Executive Officer, Deputy Chief Executive
Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief
Executive Officer Ahold Delhaize USA compared
to the average remuneration of all Ahold
Delhaize associates.

1 Since the Deputy CEO and the CEO Ahold Delhaize USA
joined the Company on July 24, 2016, full year numbers
for 2016 are not available.

We have calculated the pay ratio between
the Total Remuneration of the respective
Management Board members and the average
remuneration of all Ahold Delhaize associates
over 2016 and 2017 to convey the year-overyear changes. The average remuneration
of all associates in 2016 is calculated on the
basis of pro forma (full year 2016) labor costs.
The average remuneration of all associates is
calculated as the total labor costs (see Note 8 to
the consolidated financial statements) divided by
the number of associates on an FTE basis (see
Five-year overview). The average remuneration
of all associates amounted to €39,572 for 2016
and €40,225 for 2017. The total compensation
of the CEO, Deputy CEO, CFO and CEO Ahold
Delhaize USA can be found in Note 31 to the
consolidated financial statements.

Therefore, to put Ahold Delhaize’s pay ratios into
perspective, the graph illustrates Ahold Delhaize’s
position compared to its peers in the European
and U.S. markets as well as the AEX companies
in the peer group. The ratios mentioned in the
table and the graph are derived from the publicly
disclosed 2016 annual reports of the respective
companies. For comparison purposes the
ratios have been calculated using the same
methodology as used for Ahold Delhaize’s
pay ratio.

In 2017, the Company announced the
upcoming retirement of Pierre Bouchut from
the Management Board as well as the intended
appointment of Wouter Kolk to the Management
Board. The latter appointment will be brought
forward for shareholder approval at the annual
General Meeting of Shareholders on April 11,
2018. The implementation of these Management
Board changes will be in accordance with our
Remuneration Policy.

As set forth in the Remuneration Policy, the
total compensation of our Management
Board members is positioned at the median
level of the peer group we’ve selected for
benchmarking (see page 103). The following
table illustrates the pay ratio of our CEO
compared to the pay ratios of other CEOs in
the peer group. It is important to note that pay
ratios across industries are impacted by the
different mix of functions from one industry
to another. Even within the same industry,
comparing pay ratios is challenging due to
different market conditions (a mix of high- and
low-paying countries).

Our remuneration policy remains unchanged
for 2018. At the Supervisory Board’s discretion,
effective in 2018, two replacements have been
made in the labor market and Total Shareholder
Return (TSR) peer groups due to corporate
actions at Metro and Staples. Metro demerged into
Ceconomy and Metro Cash & Carry. The former
Metro has been replaced in each of the two peer
groups by Metro Cash & Carry. Staples was
delisted as a consequence of its purchase by
Sycamore and has been replaced by Lowe’s
Companies in each of the two peer groups.

The Remuneration Committee also conducted
interviews on Management Board remuneration
and its link to the Company’s overall strategy
with each of the members of the Management
Board. The Remuneration Committee will
continue to monitor and review Ahold Delhaize’s
Remuneration Policy to ensure that it continues to
be aligned to support the strategy and long-term
growth of the Company, the needs of all internal
and external stakeholders, and our commitment
to making a sustainable contribution to society
at large. If the Supervisory Board determines
that changes to the existing Remuneration Policy
are appropriate and required, we will seek
shareholder approval at future General Meetings.
I look forward to presenting this Remuneration
report for discussion with all our shareholders
at our upcoming annual General Meeting
of Shareholders on April 11, 2018.

Remuneration philosophy

Ahold Delhaize’s remuneration policy is aligned
with the Company’s strategy and supports a
strong and aligned performance culture. Our
remuneration policy aims at attracting, motivating
and retaining the best-qualified talent.
Management Board remuneration policy
The Supervisory Board designed the Management
Board’s remuneration policy to align with the
Company’s strategy and to support its pay-forperformance culture, while aiming to be effective,
transparent and simple. While developing the
remuneration policy, we conducted scenario
analyses to determine the risks to which variable
remuneration may expose the Company.
The basic elements of the Total Direct
Compensation provided to Management
Board members are (1) a base salary, (2) an
annual cash incentive and (3) a long-term
equity-based program. In line with our overall
remuneration philosophy, the Management
Board’s Total Direct Compensation is structured
and more heavily weighted on variable annual
and long-term incentives tied to the realization
of financial and societal performance criteria.
These performance criteria are a cornerstone
of the Company’s strategy.

The annual cash incentive is focused on the key
financial metrics of a retail organization: sales
growth, operating margin and operating cash
flow. Our focus and goal is to expand market
share, while at the same time grow margins to
increase profitability and manage capital spending
and expenses prudently to secure strong and
sustainable cash flow.
The long-term incentive is measured against (i)
our internal measure on Return on Capital (RoC),
(ii) our external measure of the Company’s share
performance relative to that of its peers: Total
Shareholder Return (TSR) and (iii) the Company’s
contribution to society through sustainability
objectives. Performance for our long-term
incentives is measured over a revolving threeyear period.
The structure of our remuneration policy aligns
the focus of the Management Board with the
interests of the Company’s shareholders,
our local communities and society at large.
Compensation and awards are tied to and
dependent on the delivery of our strategy in a
responsible and sustainable way.
Market competitive pay
The competitiveness of the Management Board
remuneration is benchmarked annually against
a labor market peer group that reflects the
Company’s geographic operating areas and the
markets most relevant in relation to the recruitment
and retention of top management. Since Ahold
Delhaize is a Dutch-headquartered company, the
AEX market practice in the Netherlands is included.
The peer group consists of 18 companies,
including peer companies in Europe and the
United States as well as AEX-listed companies.

Walgreen
Boots Alliance
Best Buy
Staples

Unilever
Philips
Heineken
Randstad
Akzo Nobel
Relx

In anticipation of potential changes to the
labor market peer group due to delisting, mergers
or other extraordinary circumstances, the
Supervisory Board has the discretion to substitute
comparable companies. In general, geographical
composition leads in the determination of a
replacement company: for example, if a U.S.based company drops out, it is replaced
by another U.S.-based company.
The composition (risk profile) of the Total Direct
Compensation levels is also taken into account
when benchmarking base salary levels. The target
Total Direct Compensation level is typically around
the median, with base salary levels slightly below
the median and long-term incentives at the
higher end of the market to support the pay-forperformance culture and long-term focus.
An individual exception to the remuneration policy
of the Management Board applies for the CEO
Ahold Delhaize USA (Kevin Holt). The Supervisory
Board determines the remuneration for the CEO
Ahold Delhaize USA on the basis of a local
reference market, the U.S. retail labor market
reference group comprising 14 companies.

Base salary
The level of the Management Board members’
base salary is derived from the benchmarking of
Total Direct Compensation. Adjustment of the base
salary is at the discretion of the Supervisory Board.
Annual cash incentive plan:
Executive Committee Incentive Plan
The Management Board members participate
in the Executive Committee Incentive Plan
(EIP). The EIP is an annual cash incentive plan
that employs three equally weighted financial
measures: sales growth (30%), underlying
operating margin (30%) and operating cash
flow (30%), as well as personal objectives (10%).
The at-target payout as a percentage of base
salary is 100%, contingent on full achievement
of the objectives, with a cap at 150% of the base
salary in the event of above-target performance.

Long-term equity-based program:
Global Reward Opportunity
The Management Board members participate
in the Company’s long-term incentive program:
Global Reward Opportunity (GRO). Under the
GRO program, shares are granted through
a three-year program. The vesting of these
performance shares is subject to performance
over a three-year period. The GRO program
employs two financial measures: RoC (40%)
and TSR (40%). In addition, a non-financial
performance measure (20%) related to Sustainable
Retailing targets is included.
In line with market practice, the target value of the
long-term incentives granted under the program
differs by role. For the CEO, the target value is
235% of base salary; for the Deputy CEO and
CEO Ahold Delhaize USA, the target value is
200% of base salary; for the CFO, the target value
is 175% of base salary; and for the COO Europe
the target value is 150% of base salary.
The total GRO award is comprised of three
portions of shares, linked to RoC, TSR and
sustainability targets, respectively.
Linked to RoC
Of the total GRO award, the first 40% is linked
to a three-year RoC target. Dependent on
performance, the number of shares that eventually
vest may range between zero and a maximum
of 150% of the number of shares granted.

Linked to TSR
Another 40% of the total GRO award is linked
to TSR (share price growth and dividends paid
over the performance period), with performance
at vesting benchmarked against the TSR
performance of a peer group. The number
of shares that vest depends on the Company’s
relative ranking in the peer group. An independent
external adviser determines the ranking
based on TSR performance. No shares will
vest to Management Board members if the
Company ranks below the seventh position in
the performance peer group. The table below
indicates the percentage of performance shares
that vests based on the Company’s ranking.

In anticipation of potential changes to the
performance peer group due to delisting,
mergers or other extraordinary circumstances,
the Supervisory Board has the discretion to

Linked to Sustainable Retailing
For the remaining 20% of the total GRO award,
the performance at vesting is measured against
sustainable retailing targets. This measure relates
to the Company’s Sustainable Retailing strategic
ambitions. The targets set under this non-financial
performance measure are both qualitative
and quantitative. Dependent on performance,
the number of shares that may vest may range
between zero and a maximum of 150% of the
number of shares granted.
Shareholding requirements and
ownership guidelines
Management Board members must retain
the shares awarded under the GRO program
for a period of at least five years from the grant
date. The sale of a portion of the shares is
permissible to finance taxes due at the date of
vesting. All members of the Management Board
are required to hold shares in the Company with
a value equal to at least 150% of their base salary.
The holding may accumulate by retaining all
after-tax shares from the GRO program and does
not require personal share purchases.

Claw-back
A claw-back provision is applicable to the
Management Board members’ annual cash
incentive plan (EIP) as well as the long-term equity
incentive program (GRO).

Loans
Ahold Delhaize does not provide loans or
advances to members of the Management Board.
Nor does the Company issue guarantees to the
benefit of members of the Management Board.

Pensions and other contract terms
Pension
All existing pension arrangements in the
Netherlands have been brought in line with the
applicable fiscal pension regulations. The pension
plan for Management Board members is
calculated similarly to that of all other associates
of the Company in the Netherlands and is referred
to as a defined benefit plan, based on career
average salary. The retirement age (in 2017) is
67. The pensionable salary is capped at around
€100,000 (2017: € 98,995). Each Management
Board member working on a Dutch contract
pays a pension premium contribution identical
to that of all other Ahold Delhaize associates in
the Netherlands. In addition, Management Board
members receive a gross (age-dependent)
pension allowance and can choose to participate
in a Net Pension Arrangement by investing the net
(after tax) amount. The Net Pension Arrangement
is identical to that of all other associates of the
Company in the Netherlands whose pensionable
salary exceeds the cap. Participation in this Net
Pension Arrangement is voluntarily.

Additional arrangements
In addition to the remuneration of the Management
Board members, a number of additional
arrangements apply. These include expense and
relocation allowances, medical insurance and
accident insurance, use of company cars and,
if applicable, expatriate allowances, which apply
to other senior associates and are in line with
local market practice. In addition, third-party tax
services will be provided to ensure compliance
with the relevant legislative requirements.

Members of the Management Board working on
a non-Dutch contract are offered pension plans
in line with local practices.

(Service) Agreements
The term of appointment for all Management Board
members is four years. If the Company terminates
the (service) agreement of any member of the
Management Board, the severance payment is
limited to one year’s base salary. The same applies
if an initial (service) agreement for four years is not
continued in the event the Management Board
member is not reappointed. The agreement may
be terminated by the Company with a notice
period of 12 months and by the Management
Board member with a notice period of six months.

Future outlook
In light of changes to the labor market reference
group and TSR peer group due to the demerger
of Metro Group and delisting of Staples, the
Supervisory Board will include substitute
comparable companies. For benchmarking
purposes, from 2018 onwards, Metro Cash &
Carry will replace Metro Group, and Lowe’s
Companies will replace Staples in the labor market
peer group. For relative TSR measurement, this
substitution comes into effect for the 2016 and
2017 GRO awards and to-be-granted GRO
share awards.

2017 Long-term equity-based program: GRO
The Management Board members participate in Ahold Delhaize’s long-term equity-based incentive
program, GRO. The 2017 GRO award was made the day after the 2017 annual General Meeting
of Shareholders.
The vesting of the GRO performance shares is subject to performance over a period of three years
and the GRO program employs two financial measures: Return on Capital (40%) and Total Shareholder
Return (40%). In addition, a non-financial performance measure (20%) is included related to Sustainable
Retailing targets. For this purpose, performance is measured on the basis of both an external and an
internal target. The Dow Jones Sustainability Index (the external target) measures how the Company
performs on sustainability against peers in the sector. The percentage of healthy own-brand food sales
of total own-brand food sales (the internal target) is the measure we use to drive performance in pursuit
of our company objective to facilitate healthier eating.
2017 GRO grant
To calculate the number of shares to be granted, the at-target value of the award is divided by the sixmonth average share price preceding the annual award date, calculated over the fourth quarter of 2016
and the first quarter of 2017. Scenario analyses are prepared regularly to estimate the possible future
payout levels.

How we manage risk
Taking risks in a responsible way
is key to being able to fulfill our
stakeholders’ expectations

In order to meet our Better Together objectives, we
must be agile and entrepreneurial so that we can
respond quickly and effectively to rapid changes
in the retail landscape and take advantage of
business opportunities whenever and wherever
they exist. Meeting these challenges requires us to
take risks in a responsible way. Having a proactive
approach to risk management that is embedded
in our business processes benefits our decisionmaking and helps us create and preserve value.
Managing risks and unpredictable conditions in
a timely way increases the likelihood that we will
achieve our business objectives, while ensuring
compliance with internal and external requirements.
We strive for a culture of openness and
transparency in which risks are identified and
addressed proactively. Risk management is an
integral part of responsible leadership.
At Ahold Delhaize, we have created a Governance,
Risk Management and Compliance (GRC)
Framework that allows us to effectively identify,
assess and manage our risks. This GRC Framework
consists of global policies and controls as well as
a GRC committee structure that functions as a
platform to address relevant risks across functional
areas of our Company. In 2017, we implemented
the GRC committee structure at the local brand
level and continued to integrate and harmonize
our policy and control framework across the Ahold
Delhaize businesses. We are constantly reviewing
and updating our global policies, procedures
and controls to ensure consistency in our overall
compliance and to support the successful
execution of our strategy.

Risk appetite
Our risk appetite is defined by our Supervisory
Board and Management Board and is integrated
into the businesses through our strategy, global
policies, procedures, controls, and budgets.
Our appetite for each risk is determined by
considering our business objectives as well as
potential threats to achieving those objectives and
can be categorized as follows:

Governance, Risk Management & Compliance Framework

Values, strategy
& objectives

Monitor & Assurance

Leadership &
risk culture

Identify & manage risk

Policies & Procedures

Risk management
and internal control

Enterprise risk management
Ahold Delhaize’s enterprise risk management
(ERM) program is designed to provide executive
management with an understanding of the
Company’s key business risks and associated risk
management practices. Within each business,
management identifies the principal risks to
the achievement of the business objectives
and the actions needed to mitigate these risks.
Senior brand and global executives periodically
review these risks and the related mitigation
practices. The observations are aggregated
into an enterprise risk management report that
is presented to the Management Board and
Supervisory Board, as required by the Dutch
Corporate Governance Code. Our local brand
management is required to review their principal

risks and risk management practices with the
Management Board as a regular part of the
business planning and performance cycle.
Additionally, the Management Board considers
the risks impacting the Company from a strategic
perspective and provides complementary
insights into existing and emerging risks, which
are subsequently included in the consolidated
ERM process. Ahold Delhaize’s enterprise risk
management program influences the formation
of policies, procedures and controls; the
scope of internal audit activities; and the focus
of the business planning and performance
process. During 2017, we fully integrated our
risk management program into one consistent
approach for both the former Ahold and former
Delhaize group companies.

Strategic
In pursuing our Better Together strategy, Ahold
Delhaize is prepared to take risks in a responsible
way that takes our stakeholders’ interests into
account. Through our annual strategic cycle,
we follow a logical and systematic process of
analysis, dialogue and planning to optimize our
decision-making. We use a fact-based analysis
of our different markets and brands to support
our strategic decision-making process in a way
that considers financial, economic, social and
political developments that may impact our
ability to achieve our objectives. Generally, the
Company’s risk appetite is between average and
above average.
Operational
Operational risks include unforeseen incidents
that could result from failures in internal processes
or systems, human error, or adverse external
events that could negatively impact the day-today operation of our business. Our risk appetite
related to the management and execution of
our day-to-day business is generally low, as
we seek to minimize the downside impact of
operational failures.

How we manage risk
continued

Financial
With respect to financial risks, Ahold Delhaize
has a prudent financial strategy, the principles of
which are governed by the treasury policy. We are
committed to maintaining an investment-grade
credit rating and are averse to any risks that could
jeopardize the integrity of our financial reporting.
Our financial risk management, risk appetite and
sensitivities are further detailed in Note 30 of the
consolidated financial statements.
Compliance
At Ahold Delhaize, an essential part of our
strategic framework is behaving according to
our values. One of Ahold Delhaize’s values is
“Integrity,” which means that the Company and all
its associates do the right thing to earn customers’
trust. We strive for full compliance with laws and
regulations and with our policies and procedures
everywhere we do business. Consequently, our
risk appetite in this area is very low.
Sensitivity analysis
At Ahold Delhaize, we follow closely the impact of
different internal and external risk factors on our
operations. The purpose of our sensitivity analysis
is to assess these risks on the Company’s current
strategy to determine their impact on our business
and the viability of our business model, as well as
our ability to meet our financial liabilities and other
obligations. Our strategy is based on assumptions
relating to: the global economic climate, changes
in consumer behaviors, competitor actions, market
dynamics and our current and planned structure,
among other factors.

These scenarios are hypothetical and purposefully
severe for the purpose of illustrating outcomes that
could have the ability to threaten the viability of the
Company. In the case of these scenarios arising,
mitigation plans at global and brand level have
been defined, and if applicable, various options
are available to the Company to maintain liquidity
and support ongoing operations. These options
include: accessing new external funding early,
more radical short-term cost-reduction actions
and adjustments to capital allocation.
Control framework
The Ahold Delhaize control framework
incorporates risk assessment, control activities
and monitoring into our business practices at
entity-wide and functional levels. A three lines
of defense model has been adopted to provide
reasonable assurance that risks to achieving
important objectives are identified and mitigated.
Three lines of defense model
In a time of significant transition and change,
Ahold Delhaize has carried forward the
unwavering commitment to integrity that was
at the core of Ahold and Delhaize Groups prior

How we manage risk
continued

In early 2017, we launched the Ahold Delhaize
Code of Ethics, which is based on four
ethical principles:
• We respect each other
• We follow the law
• We act ethically in all our relationships
• We have the courage to speak up
The Code of Ethics is intended to help each
associate understand and follow relevant
compliance and ethical principles, and to know
when and where to ask for advice or report a
compliance or ethics breach, which includes
the use of whistleblower lines, available to our
associates in each of our locations.
In 2017, our brands’ whistleblower lines received
6,817 reports. Approximately 34% of the reports
were made anonymously. On average, 94%
of the reports were investigated and resolved
within the quarter in which they were received.
In 2017, there were no substantiated reports of
significant financial reporting, accounting, fraud
or ethical violations.
The principles in the Code apply to all
associates of Ahold Delhaize and its businesses.
Associates of certain defined grade levels are
trained in compliance with the Code on an annual
basis. The full Code is available in the corporate
governance section of Ahold Delhaize’s public
website at www.aholddelhaize.com.

Monitoring and assurance
We use a comprehensive business planning
and performance review process to monitor the
Company’s performance. This process covers
the adoption of strategy, budgeting and the
reporting of current and projected results.
We assess business performance according to
both financial and non-financial targets. In order
to meet business needs and the requirements
of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, we
have a Group-wide management certification
process in place, which requires that the executive
management team members at each of our
reporting entities send letters of representation
to the Financial Disclosure Committee on
a quarterly basis.

While the Company will no longer be subject
to the Sarbanes Oxley Act regulations related
to control over financial reporting, we are still
subject to the Dutch Corporate Governance Code,
which is consistent with Sarbanes Oxley in spirit
and substance. Consequently, we have decided
to keep our current internal control environment
in place. All of our businesses are required
to continue to maintain a sound internal control
environment with robust policies, procedures,
controls and a strong financial discipline, and
to comply with our current internal controls
framework so that we can continue to provide
a high level of assurance to our senior leadership,
Audit, Finance and Risk Committee, investors and
external regulators.

These letters confirm whether the reporting
entities are in compliance with Ahold Delhaize’s
Code of Ethics, policies on fraud prevention
and detection, accounting and internal control
standards, and disclosure requirements.

At the direction of the global Governance, Risk
& Compliance Committee, the GSO Compliance
team along with the GSO Risks and Controls team
are finalizing their review of the current global
policies, procedures and related internal control
framework with the respective operational and
executive owners. Their aim is to ensure that the
revised global standards address all relevant risks
to the Company and that the control objectives are
consistent, are applicable to all our business units
and provide a robust level of assurance. Both our
Risk & Controls and Internal Audit functions
help to ensure that we maintain and improve the
integrity and effectiveness of our system of risk
management and internal control. Internal Audit
undertakes regular risk-based, objective and
critical audits. These functions also monitor the
effectiveness of corrective actions undertaken
by management.

On July 31, 2017, Ahold Delhaize filed
a certification with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) in connection
with the deregistration of its ordinary shares,
which has terminated the Company’s U.S.
corresponding reporting obligations with
the SEC.

Governance, Risk management and
Compliance Committee
The global Governance, Risk and Compliance
(GRC) Committee is responsible for reviewing the
Company’s governance, risk management and
compliance processes. The GRC Committee is
chaired by the Chief Legal Officer and (i) advises
the Management Board and Executive Committee
on matters concerning the GRC Framework,
including an overall GRC vision and strategy,
(ii) oversees activities to develop and maintain
a fit-for-purpose GRC Framework and (iii) engages
with Ahold Delhaize’s senior management on
important developments in the context of GRC.
To support local management and provide visibility
regarding local risks to the global GRC Committee,
each of our brands has a local GRC committee
that operates in parallel to the global GRC
committee process.
During 2017, the global GRC Committee met on
a quarterly basis. In addition to Ahold Delhaize’s
Chief Legal Officer (Chairman), the Chief Executive
Officer and the Chief Financial Officer sit on the
GRC Committee, along with other members of
local and global management responsible for our
governance, risk management, accounting and
reporting, compliance and assurance functions.

How we manage risk

Declaration

Annual declaration on risk management
and control systems regarding financial
reporting risks
Ahold Delhaize supports the Dutch Corporate
Governance Code and makes the following
declaration in accordance with provision I.4.3:
The Management Board is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal risk
management and control systems. Such systems
are designed to manage rather than eliminate
the risk of failure to achieve important business
objectives, and can only provide reasonable
and not absolute assurance against material
misstatement or loss. Management is not
aware of any critical failings of these systems
during 2017.
This report includes those material risks and
uncertainties that are relevant to the expectation
of the Company’s continuity for the period of
twelve months after the preparation of the report.

With respect to financial reporting based on
the current state of affairs, it is justified that
the financial reporting is prepared on a going
concern basis and management has assessed
whether the risk management and control
systems provide reasonable assurance that the
2017 financial statements do not contain any
material misstatements. This assessment was
based on the criteria set out in COSO: Internal
Control – Integrated Framework 2013 and our
internal control framework. It included tests of the
design and operating effectiveness of entity-level
controls, transactional controls at significant
locations, and relevant general computer controls.
Any control weaknesses not fully remediated
at year-end were evaluated. Based on this
assessment, the Management Board determined
that the Company’s financial reporting systems
are adequately designed and operated
effectively in 2017 and provide reasonable
assurance that the financial statements are free
of material misstatement.

Risk factors

The principal risk factors that may impede the
achievement of Ahold Delhaize’s objectives
with respect to strategy, operations, financial
and compliance matters are described in the
following section. The enterprise risk management
system, the governance and control standards
incorporated within our GRC Framework, and
the monitoring systems described above are the
principal means by which we identify and manage
these risks. Management is not aware of any
critical failings in these systems during 2017.
The following overview of risks relating to Ahold
Delhaize should be read carefully when evaluating
the Company’s business, its prospects and the
forward-looking statements contained in this
Annual Report. The following risks, which may or
may not materialize, could have a material adverse
effect on Ahold Delhaize’s financial position,
results of operations and liquidity or could cause
actual results to differ materially from the results
contemplated in the forward-looking statements
contained in this Annual Report.

Our principal risks remain substantially unchanged
from 2016. The risk related to the Ahold Delhaize
merger has been updated to reflect the completion
of the merger and current focus on the integration.
The aggregation of risks to the Ahold Delhaize
enterprise risk management report did not result in
new principal risks, although nuances have been
identified and processed.
The risks described below are not the only risks
the Company faces. There may be additional risks
of which we are currently unaware or risks that
management believes are immaterial or otherwise
common to most companies, but which may in
the future have a material adverse effect on Ahold
Delhaize’s financial position, results of operations,
liquidity and the actual outcome of matters referred
to in the forward-looking statements contained
in this Annual Report. For additional information
regarding forward-looking statements, see the
Cautionary notice.

• Process and structural changes

• Governance structure with direct
Management Board involvement
and Supervisory Board oversight

If Ahold Delhaize is unable to realize the organizational
and growth opportunities as well as other benefits after
implementing the new U.S. structure and organization,
this could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
reputation or have a material adverse effect on Ahold
Delhaize’s financial position.

• Key staff leaving the Company

the United States

Pension plan funding (F)
Ahold Delhaize is exposed
to the financial consequences
of a number of defined benefit
pension plans covering a large
number of its associates in
the Netherlands and in the
United States

Our sustainable
business model

• Low interest rates
• Stock market performance
• Changing pension laws
• Longevity
• Increasing U.S. healthcare costs

• Governance structure with a Companywide pension committee responsible
for monitoring pension plan funding
for Company-sponsored and multiemployer plans

A decrease in equity returns or interest rates may negatively
affect the funding ratios of Ahold Delhaize’s pension
funds, which could lead to higher pension charges and
contributions payable. According to Dutch law and / or
contractually agreed funding arrangements, Ahold Delhaize
may be required to make additional contributions to its
pension plans if minimum funding requirements are not met.
In addition, a significant number of union associates in the
United States are covered by multi-employer plans (MEPs).
Significant increases in healthcare and pension funding
requirements could have a material adverse effect on
the Company’s financial position, results of operations
and liquidity.

Other risks and uncertainties

In addition to the principal risks and uncertainties
linked to our strategy above, the Company has
risks in the following areas:
Sustainable retailing (S, O)
Increased regulatory demands, stakeholder
awareness and the growing sentiment that large
retailers must address sustainability issues across
the entire supply chain mean that Ahold Delhaize’s
brands and reputation may suffer if it does
not adequately address relevant sustainability
issues affecting the food retail industry. We have
integrated Sustainable Retailing into our Better
Together strategy to ensure that it is part of our
daily business, and that we continue to improve
our performance, with a focus on three strategic
areas: promoting healthier eating, reducing
food waste and creating healthy and inclusive
workplaces. Through the implementation of our
strategy, we aim to strengthen the communities
where we operate.
In addition to addressing risks to our brand and
reputation, our Better Together and Sustainable
Retailing strategies will position us well against
the following other risks: an inability to meet our
customers’ changing needs or expectations for
healthy and sustainable products; increasing
costs due to waste or negative externalities in our
supply chain; negative impact to our associate
engagement if we do not support associates’
changing expectations of employers; lack of
suppliers able to meet improved food safety and
sustainability standards; and insufficient action
to address climate change and its impact.
For more information see Our Better Together
strategy.

Insurance programs (F)
Ahold Delhaize manages its insurable risks
through a combination of self-insurance and
commercial insurance coverage. A large part
of our operations is self-insured for workers’
compensation, general liability, property, vehicle
accident and certain healthcare-related claims.
Self-insurance liabilities are estimated based
on actuarial valuations. While we believe that
the actuarial estimates are reasonable, they are
subject to changes caused by claim reporting
patterns, claim settlement patterns, regulatory
economic conditions and adverse litigation results.
It is possible that the final resolution of some claims
may require us to make significant expenditures
in excess of our existing reserves. In addition,
third-party insurance companies that provide the
fronting insurance that is part of our self-insurance
programs require us to provide certain collateral.
We take measures to assess and monitor the
financial strength and credit-worthiness of the
commercial insurers from which we purchase
insurance. However, we remain exposed to a
degree of counterparty credit risk with respect to
such insurers. If conditions of economic distress
were to cause the liquidity or solvency of our
counterparties to deteriorate, we may not be
able to recover collateral funds or be indemnified
from the insurer in accordance with the terms
and conditions of our policies.

Pension funds and multi-employer plans (F)
A significant number of union employees in the
United States are covered by multi-employer
plans based on obligations arising from collective
bargaining agreements. The risks to the Company
involved with participating in MEPs include
the following:
• The Company’s contributions to a multiemployer plan in which it participates may be
used to fund benefits to employees of other
participating employers.
• If the Company seeks to withdraw from some
of its MEPs, it must obtain the agreement of the
applicable unions and, in connection with this,
the Company may be required to pay those
plans an amount based on its allocable share
of the unfunded vested benefits of the plan,
referred to as a withdrawal liability.
• If another participating employer stops
contributing to an MEP in which the Company
participates (e.g., due to bankruptcy), the
Company and other remaining participating
employers may have to increase their
contributions to fund the unfunded obligations of
the plan allocable to the withdrawing employer.
• An MEP in which the Company participates may
become insolvent and the Company may be
required, in certain circumstances, to increase
its contributions to fund the payment of benefits
by the MEP.
In addition, Ahold Delhaize may be required
to pay significantly higher amounts to fund U.S.
associate healthcare plans in the future.
For additional information, see Note 23 to the
consolidated financial statements.

Other financial risks (F)
Other financial risks include foreign currency
translation risk, credit risk, interest rate risk,
liquidity risk and contingent liabilities to third
parties relating to lease guarantees.
For information relating to these financial risks,
see Note 30 and Note 34 to the consolidated
financial statements.
Unforeseen tax liabilities (C)
Because Ahold Delhaize operates in a number
of countries, its income is subject to taxation in
differing jurisdictions and at differing tax rates.
Significant judgment is required in determining
the consolidated income tax position. We seek
to organize our affairs in a sustainable manner,
taking into account the applicable regulations of
the jurisdictions in which we operate. As a result
of Ahold Delhaize’s multi-jurisdictional operations,
it is exposed to a number of different tax risks
including, but not limited to, changes in tax laws
or interpretations of such tax laws. The authorities
in the jurisdictions where Ahold Delhaize operates
may review the Company’s tax returns and may
disagree with the positions taken in those returns.
An adverse outcome resulting from any settlement
or future examination of the Company’s tax returns
may result in additional tax liabilities and may
adversely affect its effective tax rate, which could
have a material adverse effect on Ahold Delhaize’s
financial position, results of operations and
liquidity. In addition, any review by the authorities
could cause Ahold Delhaize to incur significant
legal expenses and divert management’s attention
from the operation of our businesses.

Risks related to the legislative and regulatory
environment and litigation (C)
Ahold Delhaize and its businesses are subject
to various federal, regional, state and local laws
and regulations in each country in which they
operate, relating to, among other areas: zoning;
land use; antitrust restrictions; workplace safety;
public health including food and non-food
safety; environmental protection; alcoholic
beverage, tobacco and pharmaceutical sales;
and information security. Ahold Delhaize and
its businesses are also subject to a variety of
laws governing the relationship with associates,
including but not limited to minimum wage,
overtime, working conditions, healthcare, disabled
access and work permit requirements. The cost
of compliance, or the failure to comply with,
any of these laws could impact the operations
and reduce the profitability of Ahold Delhaize
or its businesses and thus could affect Ahold
Delhaize’s financial condition, reputation or results
of operations. Ahold Delhaize and its businesses
are also subject to a variety of antitrust and similar
laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which
they operate, which may impact or limit Ahold
Delhaize’s ability to realize certain acquisitions,
divestments, partnerships or mergers.

From time to time, Ahold Delhaize and its
businesses are parties to legal and regulatory
proceedings in a number of countries, including
the United States, and may be subject to
investigations or inquiries, including but not
limited to investigations or inquiries by the
competition authorities related to alleged violations
of competition laws in jurisdictions where they
conduct business. Based on the prevailing
regulatory environment or economic conditions in
the markets in which Ahold Delhaize businesses
operate, litigation, investigations or inquiries may
increase in frequency and materiality. These legal
and regulatory proceedings may include matters
involving personnel and employment issues,
personal injury, antitrust claims, data privacy
and data protection claims, franchise claims and
other contract claims and matters, among others.
We estimate our exposure to these legal and
regulatory proceedings and establish provisions
for the estimated liabilities where it is reasonably
possible to estimate and where the potential
realization of a loss contingency is more likely
than not.
The assessment of exposures and ultimate
outcomes of legal and regulatory proceedings
involves uncertainties. Adverse outcomes of these
legal proceedings, or changes in our assessments
of proceedings, could potentially result in material
adverse effects on our financial results. For further
information, see Note 34 to the consolidated
financial statements.

Non-financial information and diversity
The EU Directive on the disclosure of
non-financial and diversity-related
information was published at the
end of 2014. It was transposed into
Dutch legislation before the end
of 2016, resulting in two separate
decrees: Disclosure of non-financial
information (“Bekendmaking
niet-financiële informatie”) and
Disclosure of diversity policy
(“Bekendmaking diversiteitsbeleid”).
These decrees make it mandatory
for companies to include nonfinancial and diversity-related

to be addressed and where they can be found.

1 The Company and its operations

The principal activity of Koninklijke Ahold Delhaize N.V. (“Ahold Delhaize” or the “Company” or “Group” or “Ahold Delhaize Group”), a public limited liability
company with its registered seat and head office in Zaandam, the Netherlands, is the operation of retail food stores and e-commerce primarily in the
United States and Europe. The Company is registered with the Dutch Trade Register under number 35000363.
As of July 24, 2016, Koninklijke Ahold Delhaize N.V. is the new name of Koninklijke Ahold N.V. following the completion of the merger between Koninklijke
Ahold N.V. (“Ahold”) and Delhaize Group NV/SA (“Delhaize”).
As a result of the legal structure of the merger, Delhaize merged into Ahold. Since Ahold is the surviving entity, the historical IFRS information prior to the
merger is that of Ahold.
Ahold Delhaize’s significant subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are listed in Note 36.

2 Basis of preparation

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union
(EU) and also comply with the financial reporting requirements included in Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.
Historical cost is used as the measurement basis unless otherwise indicated.
Ahold Delhaize’s financial year is a 52- or 53-week period ending on the Sunday nearest to December 31. Financial year 2017 consisted of 52 weeks and ended
on December 31, 2017. The comparative financial year 2016 consisted of 52 weeks and ended on January 1, 2017.
These consolidated financial statements are presented in euros (€) and rounded to the nearest million euro. The following exchange rates of the euro against the
U.S. dollar ($), the Czech crown (CZK), the Romanian leu (RON), and the Serbian dinar (RSD) have been used in the preparation of these financial statements:

2 Basis of preparation continued

The preparation of financial statements requires management to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. All assumptions, expectations and forecasts used as a basis
for certain estimates within these financial statements represent good faith assessments of Ahold Delhaize’s current and future performance for which
management believes there is a reasonable basis. They involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause the Company’s actual future results,
performance and achievements to differ materially from those forecasted. The estimates, assumptions and judgments that management considers most
critical relate to:
Vendor allowances (Notes 3 and 17)
The Company must estimate the allowances that are earned based on the fulfillment of its related obligations, many of which require management to estimate
the volume of purchases that will be made during a period of time. The Company must also estimate the amount of related product that has been sold and the
amount that remains in ending inventories and allocate the allowance to cost of sales or inventories accordingly.
Income taxes (Notes 3, 10 and 34)
The ultimate tax effects of transactions may be uncertain for a considerable period of time, requiring management to estimate the related current and deferred
tax positions. The Company recognizes liabilities for uncertain tax positions when it is probable that additional tax will be due. Judgment is required in
determining whether deferred tax assets are realizable and therefore recognized in the balance sheet.
Intangible assets (Notes 3, 4 and 13)
Intangible assets acquired in a business acquisition are stated at fair value, as determined at the date of the acquisition. To determine the fair value at the
acquisition date, judgments and estimates are required.
Leases and sale and leaseback transactions (Notes 3, 22 and 33)
The classification of leases as finance leases or operating leases requires judgments about the fair value of the leased asset, the split of the fair value between
land and buildings, the economic life of the asset, whether or not to include renewal options in the lease term and the appropriate discount rate to calculate the
present value of the minimum lease payments.
Revenue recognition with respect to sale and leaseback transactions is dependent on management’s judgment of whether the Company transfers all risks
and rewards to the buyer, does not maintain (or maintains only minor) continuing involvement in the property other than the lease payments and whether the
transaction is established at fair value.
Impairments (Notes 3, 6, 8, 11, 12 and 13)
Judgments and estimates are required, not only to determine whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired, but also whether indications
exist that impairment losses previously recognized may no longer exist or may have decreased (impairment reversal). After indications of impairment have
been identified, judgments and estimates are also involved in the determination of the recoverable amount of a non-current asset. These involve estimates
of expected future cash flows (based on future growth rates and remaining useful life) and residual value assumptions, as well as discount rates to calculate
the present value of the future cash flows.
Company and multi-employer pension obligations (Notes 3 and 23)
The present value of the pension obligations depends on a number of assumptions that are determined on an actuarial basis. The assumptions used
in determining the net cost (income) for pensions include the discount rate that should be used to determine the present value of estimated future cash
outflows expected to be required to settle the pension obligations. Other key assumptions comprise longevity and future salary and pension increases.
Additional information is disclosed in Note 23.

2 Basis of preparation continued

Provisions and contingencies (Notes 3, 24 and 34)
The recognition of provisions requires estimates and judgment regarding the timing and the amount of outflow of resources. The main estimates are as follows:
• Self-insurance program: estimates and assumptions include an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported, historical loss experience, projected loss
development factors, estimated changes in claim reporting patterns, claim settlement patterns, judicial decisions and legislation.
• Loyalty programs: estimated cost of benefits to which customers participating in the loyalty program are entitled, which includes assumptions on redemption
rates. These estimates and assumptions apply to all loyalty programs, irrespective of whether they are accounted for as sales deferrals or provisions for future
payments made at redemption.
• Claims and legal disputes: management, supported by internal and external legal counsel, where appropriate, determines whether it is probable that an
outflow of resources will be required to settle an obligation. If this is the case, the best estimate of the outflow of resources is recognized.
• Severance and termination benefits: the provisions relate to separation plans and agreements and use the best estimate based on information available
to management of the cash flows that will likely occur. The amounts that are ultimately incurred may change as the plans are executed.
• Onerous contracts: mainly relate to unfavorable lease contracts and include the excess of the unavoidable costs of meeting the contractual obligations
over the benefits expected to be received under such contracts.
Fair value measurements
For financial reporting purposes, fair value measurements are categorized into Level 1, 2 or 3 based on the degree to which the inputs to the fair value
measurements are observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair value measurement in its entirety, which are described as follows:
• Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company can access at the measurement date.
• Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e., as prices) or
indirectly (i.e., derived from prices).
• Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

3 Significant accounting policies

Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial figures of the Company and its subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are entities over which the Company
has control. The Company controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to
affect those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated upon consolidation. Unrealized losses on intra-group transactions are eliminated,
unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the assets transferred.
Non-controlling interests are recorded, as appropriate, on the consolidated balance sheet, in the consolidated income statement, and in the consolidated
statement of comprehensive income for the non-controlling shareholders’ share in the net assets and the income or loss of subsidiaries. Non-controlling
shareholders’ interest in an acquired subsidiary is initially measured at the non-controlling interest’s proportion of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities
and contingent liabilities recognized. Ahold Delhaize does not have subsidiaries with non-controlling interests that are material to the Group.
Business combinations
The Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method when control is transferred to the Group. The consideration transferred in
the acquisition is generally measured at fair value, as are the identifiable net assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Transaction costs are expensed
as incurred. Any contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the acquisition date. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, then it is not
remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognized in
profit or loss.
Foreign currency translation
The financial statements of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are prepared in their functional currencies, which are determined based on the primary
economic environment in which they operate. Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on
the transaction dates. At each balance sheet date, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the entity’s functional currency at the
then prevailing rates. Exchange differences arising on the settlement and translation of monetary items are included in net income for the period. Goodwill and
fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are considered as assets and liabilities denominated in the functional currency of the
foreign entity.
Upon consolidation, the assets and liabilities of subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the euro are translated into euros using the exchange rates
prevailing at the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the respective periods. Exchange rate
differences arising during consolidation and on the translation of investments in subsidiaries are included in other comprehensive income and in equity, in the
currency translation reserve. Intercompany loans to and from foreign entities for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future
are considered to increase or decrease the net investment in that foreign entity; therefore the exchange rate differences relating to these loans are also included
in other comprehensive income and in equity, in the currency translation reserve.
On the disposal of a foreign operation resulting in loss of control, loss of joint control or loss of significant influence, the related cumulative exchange rate
difference that was included in equity is transferred to the consolidated income statement.

3 Significant accounting policies continued

Statement of cash flows
The Company has chosen to prepare the statement of cash flows using the indirect method, which presents cash flows from operating activities as the
income from continuing operations adjusted for non-cash transactions, deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or payments, and
items of income or expense associated with investing or financing cash flows. Cash flows in foreign currencies have been translated using weighted
average periodic exchange rates. Interest paid on loans is presented as a financing activity, while interest received is presented as an investing activity.
Acquisitions and divestments of businesses are presented net of cash and cash equivalents acquired or disposed of, respectively. The Company has
chosen to present dividends paid to its shareholders as a financing activity cash flow.

Ahold Delhaize’s operating segments are its retail operating companies that engage in business activities from which they earn revenues and incur
expenses and whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the Executive Committee to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the
segments and to assess their performance. In establishing the reportable segments, certain operating segments with similar economic characteristics
have been aggregated. As Ahold Delhaize’s operating segments offer similar products using complementary business models, and there is no discernible
difference in customer bases, Ahold Delhaize’s policy on aggregating its operating segments into reportable segments is based on geography, functional
currency and management oversight.
The segments’ performance is evaluated against several measures, of which operating income is the most important. Intersegment sales are executed under
normal commercial terms and conditions that would also be available to unrelated third parties.
Net sales
Ahold Delhaize generates and recognizes net sales to retail customers at the point of sale in its stores and upon delivery of goods through its online channel.
The Company also generates revenues from the sale of products to retail franchisees and affiliates that are recognized upon delivery. Ahold Delhaize
recognizes fees to franchisees and affiliates as revenue as services are performed or the granted rights are used. Revenue from the sale of gift cards and gift
certificates is recognized when the gift card or gift certificate is redeemed by the retail customer. Future discounts earned by customers in connection with
bonus or loyalty cards and other Company-sponsored programs are deferred on the balance sheet at the time of the sale and subsequently recognized in the
income statement when redeemed.
Generally, net sales and cost of sales are recorded based on the gross amount received from the customer for products sold and the amount paid to the
vendor for products purchased, excluding sales taxes and value-added taxes. However, for certain products or services, such as sales through bol.com’s
seller platform, the sale of lottery tickets, third-party prepaid phone cards, stamps and public transportation tickets, Ahold Delhaize acts as an agent and
consequently records the amount of commission income in its net sales. Net sales also reflects the value of products sold to customers for which the Company
anticipates returns from customers, when such returns are considered to be material. Currently, customer returns are only considered material with regards to
Ahold Delhaize’s online general merchandise sales. Past customer return practices provide the basis for determining the anticipated returns that the Company
is exposed to at the balance sheet date.
Cost of sales
Cost of sales includes the purchase price of the products sold and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to the location and condition ready for sale.
These costs include costs of purchasing; storing; rent; depreciation of property, plant and equipment; salaries; and transporting products to the extent that it
relates to bringing the inventories to the location and condition ready for sale.

Vendor allowances
Ahold Delhaize receives various types of vendor allowances. The most common allowances vendors offer are (i) volume allowances, which are off-invoice
or amounts billed back to vendors based on the quantity of products sold to customers or purchased from the vendor and (ii) promotional allowances, which
relate to cooperative advertising and market development efforts. Volume allowances are recognized as a reduction of the cost of the related products as they
are sold. Promotional allowances are recognized as a reduction of the cost of the related products when the Company has performed the activities specified
in the contract with the vendor.
If the contract does not specify any performance criteria, the allowance is recognized over the term of the contract. Vendor allowances are generally deducted
from cost of sales, unless there is clear evidence that they should be classified as revenue or a reimbursement of costs. Ahold Delhaize recognizes vendor
allowances only where there is evidence of a binding arrangement with the vendor, the amount can be estimated reliably and receipt is probable.
The accounting for vendor allowances requires management to apply judgments and assumptions, mainly surrounding the timing of when performance
obligations have been met, the volume of purchases that will be made during a period of time, the product remaining in ending inventory, and the probability
that funds can be collected from vendors. Using these judgments and assumptions, management’s practice is to allocate earned vendor allowances between
cost of sales and inventory based upon the amount of related product that was sold and the amount that remains in ending inventories. This practice is based
upon the turnover of the inventories.
Selling expenses
Selling expenses relate to our store and online operations and consist of employees’ salaries and wages, store expenses, rent income and rent expense
or depreciation related to stores, advertising costs and other selling expenses.
General and administrative expenses
General and administrative expenses consist of support office employees’ salaries and wages, rent and depreciation of support offices, impairment
losses and reversals, gains and losses on the sale of non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale, restructuring costs, and other general and
administrative expenses.
Share-based compensation
The grant date fair value of equity-settled share-based compensation plans is expensed, with a corresponding increase in equity, on a straight-line basis over
the vesting periods of the grants. The cumulative expense recognized at each balance sheet date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired
and the Company’s best estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest. No expense is recognized for awards that do not ultimately vest, except
for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition (e.g., total shareholder return). Those are treated as vested irrespective of whether or not the
market condition is ultimately satisfied, provided that all non-market conditions (e.g., continued employment) are satisfied.

Income taxes
Income tax expense represents the sum of current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognized in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to
items recognized directly in equity or other comprehensive income. Current tax expense is based on the best estimate of taxable income for the year, using
tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and adjustments for current taxes payable (receivable) for prior years.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and the corresponding tax
basis used in the computation of taxable income. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are generally recognized for all temporary differences. However, deferred
tax liabilities are not recognized if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition
of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realized.
Deferred tax assets, including deferred tax assets for tax loss carryforward positions and tax credit carryforward positions, are recognized to the extent
that it is probable that future taxable income will be available against which temporary differences, unused tax losses or unused tax credits can be utilized.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable
income will be available to allow all or part of the assets to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset on the balance sheet when there is a legally
enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes relate to income taxes levied by the same fiscal
authority. Current income tax assets and liabilities are offset on the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset and when the Company
intends either to settle on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
The ultimate tax effects of some transactions can be uncertain for a considerable period of time, requiring management to estimate the related current and
deferred tax positions. The Company recognizes liabilities for uncertain tax positions when it is probable that additional taxes will be due. These liabilities are
presented as current income taxes payable, except in jurisdictions where prior tax losses are being carried forward to be used to offset future taxes that will
be due; in these instances the liabilities are presented as a reduction to deferred tax assets. Interest accrued on uncertain tax positions is considered to be
a financial expense of the Company. Any other adjustments to uncertain tax position liabilities are recognized within income tax expense.
Earnings per share
Basic net income per share is calculated by dividing net income attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the year. Basic income from continuing operations per share is calculated by dividing income from continuing operations attributable to
common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted income per share is calculated by dividing the diluted net income / diluted income from continuing operations attributable to shareholders by the diluted
weighted average number of common shares outstanding. To determine the diluted income, net income and income from continuing operations are adjusted by
the expense for preferred dividends on the cumulative preferred financing shares. This preferred dividend is reversed when the cumulative preferred financing
shares have a dilutive effect on the earnings per share calculation. To determine the diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding, the
weighted average number of shares outstanding is adjusted for (i) the effect of the cumulative preferred financing shares and (ii) the conditional shares from
the share-based compensation programs. The effect of the cumulative preferred financing shares is determined by calculating the number of common shares
that would be issued upon conversion. However, the effect is only adjusted for if it has a dilutive effect on the income per share. Ahold Delhaize’s cumulative
preferred financing shares are dilutive whenever their interest per common share obtainable on conversion is lower than basic income per share.

Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through
continuing use. For this to be the case, the asset (or disposal group) must be available for immediate sale in its present condition and its sale must be highly
probable. Non-current assets (or disposal groups) classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of the asset’s carrying amount or the fair value less
costs of disposal. Depreciation or amortization of an asset ceases when it is classified as held for sale. Equity accounting ceases for an investment in a joint
venture or associate when it is classified as held for sale; instead, dividends received are recognized in the consolidated income statement.
A discontinued operation is a component of the Company that either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale, and represents a separate major line
of business or geographical area of operations or is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of
operations. Results from discontinued operations that are clearly identifiable as part of the component disposed of and that will not be recognized subsequent
to the disposal are presented separately as a single amount in the consolidated income statement. Results and cash flows from discontinued operations are
reclassified for prior periods and presented in the financial statements so that the results and cash flows from discontinued operations relate to all operations
that have been discontinued as of the balance sheet date for the latest period presented.
Property, plant and equipment
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Cost includes expenditures that are directly
attributable to the acquisition or construction of an asset and borrowing costs incurred during construction. Where applicable, estimated asset retirement costs
are added to the cost of an asset. Subsequent expenditures are capitalized only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item
will flow to the Company and the costs can be measured reliably. All other subsequent expenditures represent repairs and maintenance and are expensed
as incurred.
Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the items of property, plant and equipment, taking into account
the estimated residual value. Where an item of property, plant and equipment comprises major components having different useful lives, each such part is
depreciated separately. The assets’ useful lives are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted if appropriate.
The ranges of estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment are:

Land
Buildings
Certain structural components of buildings
Finish components of buildings
Machinery and equipment
Other

indefinite
30-40 years
10-20 years
5-10 years
3-15 years
5-10 years

The useful lives, depreciation method and residual value are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted, if appropriate.
Depreciation of assets subject to finance leases and leasehold improvements is calculated on a straight-line basis over either the lease term (including renewal
periods when renewal is reasonably assured) or the estimated useful life of the asset, whichever is shorter.
Investment property
Investment property consists of land and buildings held by Ahold Delhaize to earn rental income or for capital appreciation, or both. These properties are
not used by the Company in the ordinary course of business. The Company often owns (or leases under a finance lease) shopping centers containing both
an Ahold Delhaize and third-party retail units. In these cases, the third-party retail units generate rental income, but are primarily of strategic importance for
operating purposes to Ahold Delhaize in its retail operations. The Company recognizes the part of an owned (or leased under a finance lease) shopping
center that is leased to third-party retailers as investment property, unless it represents an insignificant portion of the property. Land and buildings leased
to franchisees are not considered to be investment property as they contribute directly to Ahold Delhaize’s retail operations. Investment property is measured
on the same basis as property, plant and equipment.

Leases and sale and leaseback transactions
Leases
Ahold Delhaize is a lessee of land, buildings and equipment under operating and finance lease arrangements. The Company classifies its leases as finance
leases when the lease agreement transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership to Ahold Delhaize. For leases determined to be finance
leases, the asset and liability are recognized based on their values at the inception of the lease at an amount equal either to the fair value of the leased asset
or the present value of the minimum lease payments during the lease term, whichever is lower. Lease payments are apportioned between interest charges
and a reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining liability balance. Contingent rentals are expensed as incurred.
Leases that do not qualify as finance leases are classified as operating leases, and the related lease payments are expensed on a straight-line basis over
the lease term, including, as applicable, any rent-free period during which Ahold Delhaize has the right to use the asset. Payments made to Ahold Delhaize
representing incentives to sign a new lease or representing reimbursements for leasehold improvements are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis
over the term of the lease as reductions to rental expense.
For leases with renewal options where the renewal is reasonably assured, the lease term used to (i) determine the appropriate lease classification, (ii) compute
periodic rental expense and (iii) depreciate leasehold improvements (unless their economic lives are shorter) includes the periods of expected renewals.
Determining whether a lease agreement is a finance or an operating lease requires judgment on various aspects. These include the fair value of the leased
asset, the split of the fair value between land and buildings, the economic life of the leased asset, whether or not to include renewal options in the lease term
and the determination of an appropriate discount rate to calculate the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Sale and leaseback
The gain or loss on sale and operating leaseback transactions is recognized in the income statement immediately if (i) Ahold Delhaize does not maintain
or maintains only minor continuing involvement in these properties, other than the required lease payments, and (ii) these transactions occur at fair value.
Any gain or loss on sale and finance leaseback transactions is deferred and amortized over the term of the lease. In classifying the leaseback in a sale and
leaseback transaction, similar judgments have to be made as described above under Leases.
In some sale and leaseback arrangements, Ahold Delhaize sells a property and only leases back a portion of that property. These properties generally involve
shopping centers that contain an Ahold Delhaize store as well as other stores leased to third-party retailers. In such situations, the Company recognizes a sale
and the resulting profit on the portion of the shopping center that is not leased back to the extent that (i) the property is sold for fair value and (ii) the risks and
rewards of owning stores that are not leased back to Ahold Delhaize have been fully transferred to the buyer. The leaseback of the Ahold Delhaize store and
any gain on the sale of the Ahold Delhaize store is accounted for under the sale and leaseback criteria described above.
In some sale and leaseback arrangements, Ahold Delhaize subleases the property to third parties (including franchisees) or maintains a form of continuing
involvement in the property sold, such as earn-out provisions or obligations or options to repurchase the property. In such situations, the transaction generally
does not qualify for sale and leaseback accounting, but rather is accounted for as a financing transaction (financing). The carrying amount of the asset remains
on the balance sheet and the sale proceeds are recorded as a financing obligation. The financing obligation is amortized over the lease term. Once Ahold
Delhaize’s continuing involvement ends, the sale is accounted for under the sale and leaseback criteria described above.

Intangible assets
Goodwill and impairment of goodwill
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the Company’s interest in the net fair value
of the identifiable assets, liabilities and assumed contingent liabilities at the date of acquisition, and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill on acquisitions of joint ventures and associates is included in the carrying amount of the investment.
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the cash-generating units (or groups of cash-generating units) that is expected to
benefit from the synergies of a business combination. Goodwill is allocated to a cash-generating unit (or group of cash-generating units) representing the
lowest level within the Company at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and is never larger than an operating segment before
aggregation. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication
that the cash-generating unit may be impaired. Goodwill on acquisitions of joint ventures and associates is assessed for impairment as part of the investment
whenever there is an indication that the investment may be impaired. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the cash-generating unit’s
carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of a cash-generating unit’s fair value less costs of disposal or its value
in use. An impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of the goodwill and then to the other assets of the cash-generating unit pro rata on
the basis of the carrying amount of each asset. An impairment loss recognized for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods.
On the partial or complete disposal of an operation, the goodwill attributable to that operation is included in the determination of the gain or loss on disposal.
Other intangible assets
Separately acquired intangible assets and internally developed software are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment losses.
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recognized at fair value at the date of acquisition (which is regarded as their cost).
Brand names and customer, franchise, and affiliate relationships acquired in business acquisitions are stated at fair value determined using an income
approach. Direct costs related to the development of software for internal use are capitalized only if the costs can be measured reliably, technological
feasibility has been established, future economic benefits are probable, and the Company intends to complete development and to use the software. All other
costs, including all overhead, general and administrative, and training costs, are expensed as incurred. Lease-related intangible assets, consisting primarily
of favorable operating lease contracts acquired in business acquisitions, are measured at the present value of the amount by which the contract terms are
favorable relative to market prices at the date of acquisition.
Amortization is computed using the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives, which are as follows:

Lease-related intangibles
Software
Customer relationships
Brand names
Franchise and affiliate relationships
Other

Remaining expected duration of the lease
3-10 years
7-25 years
indefinite
14-40 years
5-indefinite

The useful lives, amortization method and residual value are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted, if appropriate. Brand names and other
intangible assets with indefinite lives are assessed for impairment annually, or whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.

Investments in joint arrangements and associates
Investments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures depending on the contractual rights and obligations each investor has
rather than the legal structure of the joint arrangement. Joint operations arise where Ahold Delhaize has both rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities
relating to the arrangement and, therefore, the Company accounts for its share of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. Joint ventures arise where Ahold
Delhaize has rights to the net assets of the arrangement and therefore the Company equity accounts for its interest.
Associates are entities over which Ahold Delhaize has significant influence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding of between 20% and 50%
of the voting rights. Significant influence is defined as the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the entity but not control or joint
control over those policies. Associates are accounted for using the equity method.
Under the equity method, investments in joint ventures and associates are measured initially at cost and subsequently adjusted for post-acquisition changes
in Ahold Delhaize’s share of the net assets of the investment (net of any accumulated impairment in the value of individual investments). Where necessary,
adjustments are made to the financial figures of joint ventures and associates to ensure consistency with the accounting policies of the Company.
Unrealized gains on transactions between Ahold Delhaize and its joint ventures and associates are eliminated to the extent of the Company’s stake in these
investments. Unrealized losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the assets transferred.
Impairment of non-current assets other than goodwill
Ahold Delhaize assesses on a quarterly basis whether there is any indication that non-current assets may be impaired. If indicators of impairment exist, the
Company estimates the recoverable amount of the asset. If it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Company estimates
the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which it belongs. Individual stores are considered separate cash-generating units for impairment
testing purposes.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs of disposal or the asset’s value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future
cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and
the risks specific to the asset. An impairment loss is recognized in the income statement for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its
recoverable amount.
In subsequent years, Ahold Delhaize assesses whether indications exist that impairment losses previously recognized for non-current assets other than
goodwill may no longer exist or may have decreased. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of that asset is recalculated and, if required, its
carrying amount is increased to the revised recoverable amount. The increase is recognized in operating income as an impairment reversal. An impairment
reversal is recognized only if it arises from a change in the assumptions that were used to calculate the recoverable amount. The increase in an asset’s carrying
amount due to an impairment reversal is limited to the depreciated amount that would have been recognized had the original impairment not occurred.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost consists of all costs of purchase, cost of conversion, and other costs incurred in bringing
the inventories to their location and condition ready for sale, net of vendor allowances attributable to inventories. For certain inventories, cost is approximated
using the retail method, in which the sales value of the inventories is reduced by the appropriate percentage of gross margin. The cost of inventories is
determined using either the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method or the weighted average cost method, depending on their nature or use. Net realizable value is the
estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated marketing, distribution and selling expenses.

Financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities
Financial assets and liabilities are recognized when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of a financial instrument. Financial assets
are derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets expire, or if the Company transfers the financial asset to another party and
does not retain control or substantially all risks and rewards of the asset. Financial liabilities are derecognized when the Company’s obligations specified in the
contract expire or are discharged or cancelled. Purchases and sales of financial assets in the normal course of business are accounted for at settlement date
(i.e., the date that the asset is delivered to or by the Company).
At initial recognition, management classifies its financial assets as either (i) at fair value through profit or loss, (ii) loans and receivables, (iii) held to maturity
or (iv) available-for-sale, depending on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired. Financial assets are initially recognized at fair value.
For instruments not classified as at fair value through profit or loss, any directly attributable transaction costs are initially recognized as part of the asset value.
Directly attributable transaction costs related to financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are expensed when incurred.
The fair value of quoted investments is based on current bid prices. If the market for a financial asset is not active, or if the financial asset represents an
unlisted security, the Company establishes fair value using valuation techniques. These include the use of recent arm’s-length transactions, reference to other
instruments that are substantially the same, and discounted cash flow analysis, making maximum use of market inputs. Subsequent to initial recognition,
financial assets are measured as described below. At each balance sheet date, the Company assesses whether there is objective evidence that a financial
asset or a group of financial assets is impaired.
Investments at fair value through profit or loss
Investments at fair value through profit or loss are those investments that are either held for trading or designated as such by the Company. A financial asset
is classified as held for trading if it is acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term. Derivatives are classified as held for trading unless they
are designated as hedges. Financial instruments held for trading are measured at fair value and changes therein are recognized in the income statement.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They are carried at
amortized cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses. They are included in current assets, except for loans and receivables with
maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Held to maturity financial assets
Held to maturity financial assets are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and a fixed maturity that the Company has the positive
intention and ability to hold to maturity. They are carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses. They are included in
current assets, except for held to maturity financial assets with maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are either designated in this category of financial assets or not classified in any of
the other categories. They are measured at fair value based on quoted market prices with changes therein recognized directly in equity until the investment
is derecognized or determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recorded in equity is transferred to the income statement.
Investments in equity instruments that do not have a quoted market price and whose fair value cannot be reliably measured are carried at cost.
At each balance sheet date, the Company assesses whether there is objective evidence that an investment or a group of investments is impaired.
Available-for-sale financial assets are included in non-current financial assets unless they are expected to be realized or are intended for sale or consumption
within 12 months after the balance sheet date.

Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include all cash on hand balances, checks, debit and credit card receivables, short-term highly liquid cash investments, and time
deposits with original maturities of three months or less. Time deposits and similar instruments with original maturities of more than three months but less than
12 months are classified as other current financial assets. Bank overdrafts are included in short-term borrowings.
Loans and short-term borrowings
Loans and short-term borrowings are recognized initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Loans and short-term borrowings are subsequently
stated at amortized cost, unless they are designated as fair value hedges. Any difference between the proceeds and redemption value is recognized in the
income statement over the period of the loans and short-term borrowings using the effective interest method. Loans are classified as current liabilities unless
the Company has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Derivative financial instruments
All derivative financial instruments are initially recognized at fair value at the date the derivative contracts are entered into and are subsequently remeasured
to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. Gains and losses resulting from the fair value remeasurement are recognized in the income statement
as fair value gains (losses) on financial instruments, unless the derivative qualifies and is effective as a hedging instrument in a designated hedging relationship.
In order for a derivative financial instrument to qualify as a hedging instrument for accounting purposes, the Company must document (i) at the inception of
the transaction, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking
various hedging transactions and (ii) its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivative that is used in the hedging
transaction is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. Derivatives that are designated as hedges are accounted for
as either cash flow hedges or fair value hedges.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognized initially in the cash flow
hedging reserve, a separate component of equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognized immediately in the income statement.
Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified into the income statement in the same period in which the related exposure impacts the income statement.
When a cash flow hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and
is recognized when the forecasted transaction is ultimately recognized in the income statement. When a forecasted transaction is no longer expected to
occur, the cumulative gain or loss existing in equity is immediately recognized in the income statement.
Fair value changes of derivative instruments that qualify for fair value hedge accounting treatment are recognized in the income statement in the periods
in which they arise, together with any changes in fair value of the hedged asset or liability. If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge
accounting, the adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item is amortized in the income statement over the remaining period to maturity of the
hedged item.
Reinsurance assets and liabilities
Under Ahold Delhaize’s self-insurance program, part of the insurance risk is ceded under a reinsurance treaty, which is a pooling arrangement between
unrelated companies. In accordance with the pooling arrangement, the Company assumes a share of the reinsurance treaty risks that is measured in
relation to the percentage of Ahold Delhaize’s participation in the treaty. Reinsurance assets include estimated receivable balances related to reinsurance
contracts purchased by the Company. Reinsurance liabilities represent the expected insurance risks related to reinsurance contracts sold by the Company.
Reinsurance assets and liabilities are measured on a discounted basis using accepted actuarial methods.

Financial guarantees
Financial guarantees made by Ahold Delhaize to third parties that may require the Company to incur future cash outflows if called upon to satisfy are
recognized at inception as liabilities at fair value. Fair value is measured as the premium received, if any, or calculated using a scenario analysis. Subsequently,
the liability is measured at the higher of the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation or the amount initially recognized less cumulative
amortization corresponding to the expiration or repayment of the underlying amount guaranteed.
Equity
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the value of proceeds received. Own equity instruments that are bought back (treasury shares)
are deducted from equity and recognized on a first-in, first-out basis. Incremental costs that are directly attributable to issuing or buying back own equity
instruments are recognized directly in equity, net of the related tax. No gain or loss is recognized in the income statement on the purchase, sale, issuance
or cancellation of the Company’s own equity instruments.
Cumulative preferred financing shares
Cumulative preferred financing shares, for which dividend payments are not at the discretion of the Company, are classified as non-current financial liabilities
and are stated at amortized cost. The dividends on these cumulative preferred financing shares are recognized as interest expense in the income statement,
using the effective interest method. From the date on which Ahold Delhaize receives irrevocable notification from a holder of cumulative preferred financing
shares to convert these shares into common shares, the cumulative preferred financing shares are classified as a separate class of equity.
Pension and other post-employment benefits
The net assets and net liabilities recognized on the consolidated balance sheet for defined benefit plans represent the actual surplus or deficit in Ahold
Delhaize’s defined benefit plans measured as the present value of the defined benefit obligations less the fair value of plan assets. Any surplus resulting from
this calculation is limited to the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.
Defined benefit obligations are actuarially calculated on the balance sheet date using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined
benefit obligations is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using market yields on high-quality corporate bonds (i.e., bonds rated
AA or higher), denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have an average duration similar to the expected duration of the related
pension liabilities.
Defined benefit costs are split into three categories:
• Service cost, past service cost, gains and losses on curtailment and settlements
• Net interest expense or income
• Remeasurement
The first category is presented as labor costs within operating earnings. Past-service costs are recognized in the income statement in the period of plan
amendment. Results from curtailments or settlements are recognized immediately.
Past service years within the Dutch pension fund are calculated based upon a methodology that uses the maximum past service years based on accrued
benefits or a participant’s actual date of hire.

3 Significant accounting policies continued

Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset and is presented within net financial expenses.
Remeasurements, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling (if applicable) and the return on plan assets (excluding
interest) are recognized immediately in the balance sheet with a charge or credit to other comprehensive income in the period in which it occurs.
Remeasurements recorded in other comprehensive income are not recycled to the income statement.
Contributions to defined contribution plans are recognized as an expense when employees have rendered service entitling them to the contributions.
Post-employment benefits provided through industry multi-employer plans, managed by third parties, are generally accounted for under defined
contribution criteria.
For other long-term employee benefits, such as long-service awards, provisions are recognized on the basis of estimates that are consistent with the estimates
used for the defined benefit obligations, but discounted using Ahold Delhaize’s cost of debt rate. For these, all actuarial gains and losses are recognized in the
income statement immediately.
Provisions
Provisions are recognized when (i) the Company has a present (legal or constructive) obligation as a result of past events, (ii) it is probable that an outflow of
resources will be required to settle the obligation, and (iii) the amount can be reliably estimated. The amount recognized is the best estimate of the expenditure
required to settle the obligation. Provisions are discounted whenever the effect of the time value of money is significant.
The provision for the Company’s self-insurance program is recorded based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported.
The provision includes expenses incurred in the claim settlement process that can be directly associated with specific claims. Other expenses incurred in
the claim settlement process are expensed when incurred. The Company’s estimate of the required liability of such claims is recorded on a discounted basis,
utilizing an actuarial method based upon various assumptions that include, but are not limited to, historical loss experience, projected loss development factors
and actual payroll costs.
Restructuring-related provisions for severance and termination benefits are recognized when the Company has approved a detailed formal restructuring plan
and the restructuring has either commenced or has been announced to those affected by it. Onerous contract provisions are measured at the amount by which
the unavoidable costs to fulfill agreements exceeds the expected benefits from such agreements.
New accounting policies effective for 2017
Amendments to IAS 12, “Income taxes”
The amendments address the recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealized losses on debt instruments measured at fair value, as well as how deductible
temporary differences should be measured in situations when tax law limits the offsetting of certain types of losses against specific sources of taxable profits.
The application of these amendments does not have a significant effect on the results of the consolidated financial statements.
Amendments to IAS 7, “Disclosure Initiative”
The amendments require additional cash flow disclosures surrounding changes in liabilities arising from financing activities, including changes arising from
both cash flows and non-cash changes. The application of these amendments does not have a significant effect on the results of the consolidated financial
statements, but they have resulted in additional disclosures in Note 28 on the changes in liabilities arising from financing activities.
Annual improvements to IFRSs 2014-2016
A number of amendments were made to various IFRSs that do not have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements.

3 Significant accounting policies continued

New accounting policies not yet effective for 2017
The IASB issued several standards, or revisions to standards, that are not yet effective for 2017, but will become effective in coming years.
IFRS 9, “Financial Instruments”
IFRS 9 addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. The Company has reviewed its financial assets
and liabilities and is expecting the following effects from the adoption of the new standard on January 1, 2018.
The majority of the Company’s debt instruments that are currently measured at amortized cost will satisfy the conditions to be classified at amortized costs
under IFRS 9, so there will be no change to how we account for these assets. However, certain investments in U.S. Treasury bond funds that are currently
classified as available-for-sale financial assets do not meet the criteria to be classified as either at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)
or at amortized cost and €157 million will be reclassified to financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL). Related fair value gains of €4 million
will be transferred from the available-for-sale financial assets reserve to retained earnings on January 1, 2018. There are no other changes expected to the
classification and measurement of other financial assets.
There will be no effect on the Group’s accounting for financial liabilities. The new requirements only affect the accounting for financial liabilities that are
designated at fair value through profit or loss. For the Group, only derivatives and reinsurance liabilities are designated at fair value through profit or loss and
there are no changes in the accounting for these liabilities as a result of IFRS 9. The derecognition rules have not changed from IAS 39, “Financial Instruments:
Recognition and Measurement.”
The new hedge accounting rules will align the accounting for hedging instruments more closely with the Group’s risk management practices. As a general rule,
more hedge relationships could be eligible for hedge accounting, as the standard introduces a more principles-based approach. The Company has assessed
that its current hedge relationships will qualify as continuing hedges upon the adoption of IFRS 9.
The new impairment model requires the recognition of impairment provisions based on expected credit losses rather than only incurred credit losses as is the
case under IAS 39. It applies to financial assets measured at amortized cost, debt instruments measured at FVOCI, contract assets under IFRS 15, “Revenue
from Contracts with Customers,” lease receivables, loan commitments and certain financial guarantee contracts. Based on the assessments undertaken to
date, the Company expects an increase of less than €5 million in the loss allowance for its financial receivables.
The new standard also introduces expanded disclosure requirements and changes in presentation. These are expected to change the nature and extent of the
Company’s disclosures about its financial instruments, particularly in the year of the adoption of the new standard.
IFRS 9 must be applied for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018. The Company will apply the new rules retrospectively from January 1, 2018,
applying the practical expedients permitted under the standard. Comparatives for 2017 will not be restated.
IFRS 15, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”
IFRS 15 establishes a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue from contracts with customers. IFRS 15 will supersede
the current revenue recognition guidance, including IAS 18, “Revenue,” IAS 11, “Construction Contracts,” and the related interpretations when it becomes
effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018. Under IFRS 15, an entity recognizes revenue when (or as) a performance obligation is
satisfied, i.e., when “control” of the goods or services underlying the particular performance obligation is transferred to the customer.
The majority of the Company’s revenue is derived from sales of retail products whereby control is transferred to the customer as purchases occur at the
register. For goods shipped to customers, control transfers to the customer when the product is delivered and accepted. The Company currently recognizes
revenue as control passes and the adoption of IFRS 15 will have no effect on when revenue is recognized.

3 Significant accounting policies continued

The Company’s policy is to allow customers to return product for replacement or refund. Revenue is currently recognized with an allowance for a reasonable
estimate of the returns that can be made for a refund and this will remain unchanged after adoption of IFRS 15. However, under IFRS 15, the Company will
now be required to recognize an asset that represents the right to receive returned product. The value of this asset should represent the purchase cost of only
the goods that will be of value to Ahold Delhaize. A returned product will have value to Ahold Delhaize if it can be restocked for future resale or returned to the
vendor for a refund. Based on the limited amount of sales that result in refunds to customers, the Company has concluded that the recognition of this new asset
will have an effect of less than €5 million on the Group’s financial statements.
IFRS 15 will require the Company to add additional disclosures surrounding its contracts with customers, the sources of revenues that it generates, and the
judgments that it uses when recognizing revenue.
IFRS 15 must be applied for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018. The Company will apply the new rules retrospectively from January 1, 2018,
with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard recognized as of that date. Comparatives for 2017 will not be restated.
IFRS 16, “Leases”
16 replaces existing lease guidance, including IAS 17, “Leases,” IFRIC 4, “Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease,” SIC-15, “Operating
Leases – Incentives,” and SIC-27, “Evaluating the Substance of Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease.” The standard is effective for annual periods
beginning on or after January 1, 2019.
IFRS 16 introduces a single, on-balance sheet lease accounting model for lessees. A lessee recognizes a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the
underlying asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments. There are recognition exemptions for short-term leases and leases
of low-value items. Lessor accounting remains similar to the current standard, i.e., lessors continue to classify leases as finance or operating leases. However,
subleases under IFRS 16 are classified with reference to the right-of-use asset, not with reference to the underlying asset, as per IAS 17. As a result, in the
future, subleases are more likely to be classified as finance leases. In addition, the nature of expenses related to leases will change as IFRS 16 replaces the
operating lease expense with a depreciation charge for right-of-use assets and interest expense on lease liabilities.
The Company has completed an initial assessment of the potential effect on its consolidated financial statements but has not yet completed its detailed
assessment. The data enrichment process is currently in progress and detailed calculations on the full lease portfolio will be performed thereafter. The actual
effect of applying IFRS 16 on the financial statements in the period of initial application will depend on the composition of the Company’s lease portfolio at the
transition date, the Company’s latest assessment of whether it will exercise any lease renewal or termination options, and the extent to which the Group chooses
to use recognition exemptions.
While no significant effect is expected for the Company’s current finance leases, it is expected that more subleases will be classified as finance leases under
IFRS 16, resulting in new net investments in leases (lease receivables).
On transition to IFRS 16, the Company must determine whether an arrangement contains a lease. When performing this assessment, the Company can choose
whether to apply the IFRS 16 definition of a lease to all its contracts or apply the practical expedient allowed under IFRS 16 and not reassess whether a contract
is, or contains, a lease. The Company plans to apply the practical expedient to grandfather the definition of a lease upon transition. This means that it will apply
IFRS 16 to all contracts entered into before January 1, 2019, and identified as leases in accordance with IAS 17 and IFRIC 4.
The transition provisions of IFRS 16 allow the Company to apply the standard using a full retrospective approach or a modified retrospective approach, with
optional practical expedients. Whichever approach is chosen, the Company must apply the election consistently to all of its leases. The Company will adopt
IFRS 16 on January 1, 2019. The Company has not yet made a final decision on the transition approach, pending the finalization of the data enrichment
process. The Company is not required to make any adjustments for leases in which it is a lessor except where it is an intermediate lessor in a sub-lease.
As of December 31, 2017, the Company’s future contractual minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases to third parties amounted to
€7,590 million, on an undiscounted basis (see Note 33). When including the renewal options that are reasonably certain to be exercised, but not yet committed
to, the future minimum lease payments amount to €9,631 million (within one year: €1,153 million, between one and five years: €3,693 million, after five years:
€4,785 million), on a undiscounted basis.

3 Significant accounting policies continued

IFRS 17, “Insurance Contracts”
IFRS 17 replaces IFRS 4, “Insurance Contracts.” It requires a current measurement model where estimates are re-measured each reporting period.
The standard allows a choice between recognizing changes in discount rates either in the income statement or directly in other comprehensive income.
IFRS 17 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2021. The Company has yet to assess the standard’s full impact.
Amendments to IFRS 2, “Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions”
The amendments to IFRS 2 were made to provide requirements on the accounting for the effects of vesting and non-vesting conditions on the measurement
of cash-settled share-based payments; share-based payment transactions with a net settlement feature for withholding tax obligations; and a modification to
the terms and conditions of a share-based payment that changes the classification of the transaction from cash-settled to equity-settled. The amendments
to IFRS 2 apply prospectively for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018. The Company does not anticipate that the application of these
amendments to IFRS 2 will have a significant effect on the future consolidated financial statements.
Amendments to IFRS 4, “Applying IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts”
The amendments to IFRS 4 were made to give all companies that issue insurance contracts the option to recognize in other comprehensive income, rather
than profit or loss, the volatility that could arise when IFRS 9 is applied before the new insurance contracts standard is issued; and to give companies whose
activities are predominantly connected with insurance an optional temporary exemption from applying IFRS 9 until 2021. The amendments to IFRS 4 apply
prospectively for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018. Based on Ahold Delhaize’s current business model, the Company does not anticipate
that the application of these amendments to IFRS 4 will have a significant effect on the future consolidated financial statements.
Amendments to IAS 28, “Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures”
The amendments to IAS 28 were made to clarify that IFRS 9, “Financial Instruments,” applies to long-term interests in an associate or joint venture that form part
of the net investment in the associate or joint venture but to which the equity method is not applied. The amendments to IAS 28 apply prospectively for annual
periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019. The Company does not anticipate that the application of these amendments to IAS 28 will have a significant
effect on the future consolidated financial statements.
Amendments to IAS 40, “Transfers of Investment Property”
The amendments to IAS 40 were made to clarify that transfers to, or from, investment property can only be made if there has been a change in use that is
supported by evidence. The amendments to IAS 40 apply prospectively for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018. The Company does not
anticipate that the application of these amendments to IAS 40 will have a significant effect on the future consolidated financial statements.
IFRIC 22, “Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration”
IFRIC 22 clarifies how to determine the date of transaction for the exchange rate to be used on initial recognition of a related asset, expense or income
when an entity pays or receives consideration in advance for foreign currency-denominated contracts. IFRIC 22 applies prospectively for annual periods
beginning on or after January 1, 2018. The Company does not anticipate that the application of IFRIC 22 will have a significant effect on the future consolidated
financial statements.
IFRIC 23, “Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments”
IFRIC 23 clarifies guidance on considering uncertain tax treatments separately or together, assumptions about examinations by tax authorities, and the
appropriate method to reflect uncertainty and accounting for changes in facts and circumstances. IFRIC 23 applies prospectively for annual reporting
periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019. The Company has not yet performed a detailed assessment of its known uncertain tax positions, but,
based upon preliminary assessments of its more significant uncertain positions, the application of IFRIC 23 is not anticipated to have a significant effect
on the future consolidated financial statements.
There are no other IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that have been issued but are not yet effective that are expected to have a material effect on the future
consolidated financial statements.

4 Acquisitions

Ahold Delhaize merger
On July 23, 2016, Ahold and Delhaize announced the completion of their merger, which became effective on July 24, 2016. The merger has been accounted
for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting under IFRS 3, with Ahold being identified as acquirer.
The purchase consideration was €10,765 million, consisting of the following:
Purchase consideration

€ million

Ordinary shares issued (i)
Amount attributable to purchase consideration in respect of replacement awards issued (ii)
Total purchase consideration

10,761

10,765

(i) Under the terms of the merger, Delhaize shareholders were offered 4.75 ordinary shares in the Company for each share held in Delhaize. On completion
of the merger, 496,000,577 ordinary shares were issued. The fair value of the shares issued as part of the consideration paid was based on the published
share price on July 23, 2016, of €21.695 per share.
(ii) In accordance with the terms of the merger agreement, the Company exchanged certain equity-settled share-based payment awards held by employees
of Delhaize (the acquiree’s awards) for equity-settled share-based payment awards of the Company (the replacement awards).
The total value of the replacement awards is €9 million. The consideration for the business combination includes €4 million transferred to employees of
Delhaize when the acquiree’s awards were substituted by the replacement awards, which relates to past service. The balance of €5 million will be recognized
as post-acquisition compensation cost over the relevant service period.
Since the merger date, Delhaize contributed net sales of €11,001 million and a net income of €239 million (representing the results of the Delhaize operating
entities plus any remaining head office and other charges from the Delhaize entities) to the 2016 results.
Assuming that the acquisition occurred on January 4, 2016, management reported on a pro forma basis consolidated net sales of €62,331 million through
January 1, 2017, and consolidated pro forma net income of €1,078 million. The pro forma information is based on the historical Ahold and Delhaize quarters.
The following main adjustments to the combined historical data were made to arrive at the pro forma information: (i) exclusion of the performance of remedy
stores and other divestments; (ii) exclusion of merger transaction costs; (iii) inclusion of purchase price allocation effects; (iv) alignment of Global Support Office
functions and related costs; and (v) alignment of foreign exchange rates used in the translation of foreign group entities.
Ahold and Delhaize incurred transaction costs of €135 million for banking fees, legal fees and other professional fees, of which €62 million was booked by
Ahold and Delhaize in 2015, €73 million in 2016 and nil in 2017. Transaction costs of €38 million (2016) and of nil (2017) have been included in General and
administrative expenses as Restructuring and related charges and other.
In the second half of 2016 and the first half of 2017, there were measurement period adjustments recognized subsequent to the amounts initially recognized
and reported in 2016. These measurement period adjustments were made to reflect facts and circumstances that existed as of the 2016 merger date and
not as a result of events occurring subsequent to the merger date. As a result of all measurement period adjustments, the amount of goodwill on the merger
reported in 2016 has been increased by €36 million to an amount of €5,962 million, with the related adjustments to other assets and liabilities. The goodwill
represents expected synergies from the combination of the operations, which at the date of this report is treated as non-deductible for tax purposes.
All known measurement period adjustments have been made and the allocation of the purchase price to the estimated fair values of the identifiable assets
acquired and the liabilities assumed was finalized in 2017. The following is a summary of the initially reported and final allocation of the purchase consideration.

Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale
Total assets held for sale
Liabilities related to assets held for sale

Assets held for sale at December 31, 2017, is comprised primarily of non-current assets of retail locations (The Netherlands: €10 million, Central
and Southeastern Europe: €4 million). The balances at January 1, 2017, consisted of non-current assets and associated liabilities of retail locations
(Ahold USA: €27 million with associated liabilities of €9 million, The Netherlands: €19 million), including in part the remedy stores. In 2016, as part of the
approval of the merger between Ahold and Delhaize Group by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, Ahold and Delhaize subsidiaries entered into agreements
to sell 86 stores in the United States. The approval of the Belgian Competition Authority was conditional upon the divestment of 13 stores and a limited number
of projects in Belgium. During 2016, of the 86 stores in the United States, Ahold USA divested eight out of 15 stores and Delhaize America divested all of the
71 stores. In 2016, the divestment of remedy stores resulted in an €18 million gain at Ahold USA. As part of the purchase price allocation, the property, plant
and equipment and associated liabilities of Delhaize America’s remedy stores were recognized at fair value. Therefore, the divestments resulted in an
insignificant loss at Delhaize America. None of the 13 stores in Belgium (eight Albert Heijn stores and five Delhaize franchisee stores) were divested in 2016.
During 2017, Ahold Delhaize’s U.S. and Belgian subsidiaries completed the divestment process of the remedy stores, realizing a gain of €31 million at Ahold
USA, a loss of €8 million in Belgium and an insignificant loss in the Netherlands.
In addition, during 2016 Ahold Delhaize completed the sale of pet specialist shop chain Tom & Co with an insignificant divestment loss.
The remedy stores and Tom & Co do not represent discontinued operations.

Interest income primarily relates to interest earned on cash and cash equivalents and short-term cash deposits and similar instruments.
Interest expense primarily relates to financial liabilities measured at amortized cost (which include notes, finance lease liabilities, financing obligations and
cumulative preferred financing shares), interest accretions to provisions, and amortization of the fair value allocation of the debt brought in through acquisitions
(refer to Note 4).
Net interest expense on defined benefit pension plans is caused by the Company’s pensions plans being in a liability position over 2017 and 2016.
Gains (losses) on foreign exchange on financial assets and liabilities are presented as part of net financial expenses. The losses on foreign exchange in 2017
resulted from the translation of foreign currency denominated loans as a result of the strengthening of the euro versus the U.S. dollar. The losses on foreign
exchange are offset by fair value gains on financial instruments from derivatives, which do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.
Foreign exchange results arising from the purchase of goods for sale or goods and services consumed in Ahold Delhaize’s operations are included in cost of
sales or in the appropriate element of operating expenses, respectively. In 2017, the Company recorded a net exchange gain (including the impact of foreign
exchange hedging instruments) of €1 million in operating income (2016: gain of €1 million).
In 2016, the line item Other consists mainly of the one-off finance cost of €243 million relating to the buyback and cancellation of the outstanding principal
amount of its JPY33 billion floating rate notes, due May 2031, and the unwinding of the associated yen / euro cross-currency interest rate swap.

10 Income taxes continued

On December 22, 2017, new U.S. tax legislation was enacted. The new law includes the reduction of the statutory federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%
effective January 1, 2018, which affected Ahold Delhaize’s U.S. deferred tax position at the end of 2017. In addition, on December 25, 2017, new Belgian tax
legislation was enacted. The new Belgian tax law includes the reduction of the statutory corporate income tax rate from 33% to 29% in 2018 and to 25% starting
in 2020, which affected Ahold Delhaize’s Belgian deferred tax position at the end of 2017. The tax rate changes as a result of local tax reforms show the impact
of recalculating the deferred tax positions of Ahold USA, Delhaize America and Delhaize Belgium, applying the reduced U.S. and Belgian corporate income tax
rates. The effects of tax reforms have been included in the reported tax balances based on the information per reporting date. The Company keeps following
any development and further clarifications of changes in tax laws and will make adjustments to the tax balances accordingly.
Income taxes on discontinued operations
Current and deferred income tax related to discontinued operations amounted to nil in 2017 and in 2016.

Operating and capital loss carryforwards related to one jurisdiction may not be used to offset income taxes in other jurisdictions. Of the loss carryforwards,
€2,265 million relates to U.S. state taxes, for which a weighted average tax rate of 7.25% applies.
The majority of the above-mentioned deferred tax assets relate to tax jurisdictions in which Ahold Delhaize has suffered a tax loss in the current or a preceding
period. Significant judgment is required in determining whether deferred tax assets are realizable. Ahold Delhaize determines this on the basis of expected
taxable profits arising from the reversal of recognized deferred tax liabilities and on the basis of budgets, cash flow forecasts and impairment models.
Where utilization is not considered probable, deferred tax assets are not recognized.
No deferred income taxes are recognized on undistributed earnings of Ahold Delhaize’s subsidiaries and joint ventures, as the undistributed earnings will not
be distributed in the foreseeable future. The cumulative amount of undistributed earnings on which the Group has not recognized deferred income taxes was
approximately €28 million at December 31, 2017 (January 1, 2017: €4,713 million). The decrease for 2017 is predominantly caused by a change in Belgian tax
legislation effective January 1, 2018.

11 Property, plant and equipment continued

Buildings and land includes stores, distribution centers, warehouses and improvements to these assets. “Other” property, plant and equipment mainly
consists of furnishings, machinery and equipment, trucks, trailers and other vehicles. Assets under construction mainly consists of stores.
The higher of the value in use or fair value less cost of disposal represents an asset’s recoverable amount. The value-in-use method involves estimating
future cash flows. The present value of estimated future cash flows has been calculated using pre-tax discount rates ranging between 6.0% and 16.9%
(2016: 5.8% – 17.3%). Fair value represents the price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants and is
generally measured by using an income approach or a market approach. The income approach is generally applied by using discounted cash flow
projections based on the assets’ highest and best use from a market participants’ perspective. The market approach requires the comparison of the subject
assets to transactions involving comparable assets by using inputs such as bid or ask prices or market multiples.
In 2017, Ahold Delhaize recognized net impairment losses of €56 million for property, plant and equipment (2016: €71 million). These were mainly related to
Ahold USA (2017: €50 million, 2016: €60 million) and The Netherlands (2017: €1 million reversal, 2016: €6 million) and were recognized for various operating
and closed stores. In 2017, the fair value less cost of disposal was the recoverable amount in the determination of €24 million of the net impairment losses
(2016: €40 million). In 2017, this included a €12 million charge related to closure of bfresh locations and a €7 million net impairment for other divestment stores.
In 2016, as part of approval of the merger between Ahold and Delhaize Group by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, Ahold USA entered into agreements
to sell 15 stores (“remedy stores,” see Note 5). In addition to remedy stores, Ahold USA intended to divest another 10 stores in the Richmond area (“other
divestment stores’’). In 2016, Ahold USA incurred net impairment charges of €17 million in total for the property, plant and equipment of the remedy stores
before they were classified as held for sale and a €3 million impairment for the stores’ associated fixed assets to be abandoned. In 2016, impairments for the
property, plant and equipment of the other divestment stores of Ahold USA amounted to €20 million. The impairments related to the bfresh locations, remedy
and other divestment stores were mainly based on the bid prices received or exit assumptions other than sale.
The additions to property, plant and equipment include capitalized borrowing costs of €2 million (2016: €1 million). Generally, the capitalization rate used to
determine the amount of capitalized borrowing costs is a weighted average of the interest rate applicable to the respective operating companies. This rate
ranged between 2.0% and 10.3% (2016: 1.8% – 10.6%).
Other movements mainly include transfers between asset classes and transfers to investment property.
The carrying amount of land and buildings includes amounts related to assets held under finance leases and financings of €1,093 million and €177 million,
respectively (January 1, 2017: €1,323 million and €210 million). In addition, the carrying amount of other property, plant and equipment includes an amount
of €36 million (January 1, 2017: €37 million) relating to assets held under finance leases. Ahold Delhaize does not have legal title to these assets.
Company-owned property, plant and equipment with a carrying amount of €43 million (January 1, 2017: €51 million) has been pledged as security for liabilities,

1 2016 included €171 million for the fair value of the investment property recognized in connection with the merger between Ahold and Delhaize (see Note 4).

A significant portion of the Company’s investment property comprises shopping centers containing both an Ahold Delhaize store and third-party retail units.
The third-party retail units generate rental income, but are primarily of strategic importance to Ahold Delhaize in its retail operations. Ahold Delhaize recognizes
the part of a shopping center leased to a third-party retailer as investment property, unless it represents an insignificant portion of the property.
In 2017, Ahold Delhaize recognized net impairment losses of €4 million (2016: €10 million). These were mainly related to Ahold USA (2017: €3 million,
2016: €10 million).
The carrying amount of investment property includes an amount related to assets held under finance leases and financings of €25 million and €37 million
(January 1, 2017: €35 million and €42 million), respectively. Ahold Delhaize does not have legal title to these assets. Company-owned investment property with
a carrying amount of €80 million (January 1, 2017: €93 million) has been pledged as security for liabilities, mainly for loans.
The fair value of investment property as of December 31, 2017, amounted to approximately €808 million (January 1, 2017: €937 million). Fair value represents the
price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants and has generally been measured by using an income or
market approach. Approximately 70% of Ahold Delhaize’s fair value measurements are categorized within Level 2. The most significant inputs into this valuation
approach are observable market retail yields and tenant rents to calculate the fair value. The remaining fair value measurements that are categorized within
Level 3 primarily include the fair value measurements based on the Company’s own valuation methods and the fair value for certain mixed-use properties and
properties held for strategic purposes. For certain mixed-use properties and properties held for strategic purposes, Ahold Delhaize cannot determine the fair
value of the investment property reliably. In such cases, the fair value is assumed to be equal to the carrying amount.
Rental income from investment property included in the income statement in 2017 amounted to €70 million (2016: €76 million). Direct operating expenses
(including repairs and maintenance but excluding depreciation expense) arising from rental-income-generating and non-rent-generating investment property
in 2017 amounted to €34 million (2016: €35 million).

Goodwill recognized on acquisitions in 2017 includes measurement period adjustments of €36 million to the amount recognized in 2016 (€5,926 million) in
connection with the merger of Ahold and Delhaize Group (see Note 4 for more details). Goodwill acquired in business combinations is allocated, at acquisition,
to the cash-generating units (CGUs) or groups of CGUs expected to benefit from that business combination.
Brand names include retail brands as well as certain own brands referring to ranges of products. Retail brands are strong and well-established brands of
supermarkets, convenience stores and online stores protected by trademarks that are renewable indefinitely in their relevant markets. There are not believed
to be any legal, regulatory or contractual provisions that limit the useful lives. Ahold Delhaize brands play an important role in the Company’s business strategy.
Ahold Delhaize believes that there is currently no foreseeable limit to the period over which the retail brands are expected to generate net cash inflows, and
therefore they are assessed to have an indefinite useful life.
The carrying amounts of goodwill allocated to CGUs within Ahold Delhaize’s reportable segments and brands recognized from business acquisitions are

January 1, 2017: €2 million).

CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if there are indications that a particular CGU might be
impaired. Except for Delhaize Belgium (including Belgium and Luxembourg), Food Lion and Hannaford, the recoverable amounts for the CGUs have been
determined based on value in use.

Value in use
Value in use is determined using discounted cash flow projections that generally cover a period of five years and are based on the financial plans approved
by the Company’s management. Due to the expected continuation of high growth in the relevant online retail markets, we project cash flow for bol.com and
Peapod over 10-year periods to better reflect the growth expectations in sales, profitability and cash generation as these businesses have not yet reached
a steady stage. The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations relate to the weighted average cost of capital (hereafter: discount rate), sales growth
and operating margin. The pre-tax discount rates are 10.0% for Ahold USA brands, 8.7% for Peapod, 7.0% for The Netherlands brands, 12.2% for bol.com,
7.4% for the Czech Republic, 17.1% for Greece, 10.3% for Romania and 12.0% for Serbia. The sales growth rates and operating margins used to estimate
future performance are based on past performance and our experience of growth rates and operating margins achievable in Ahold Delhaize’s main markets.
The average annual compound sales growth rates applied in the projected periods ranged between 12.5% and 13.2% for the CGUs of our online business
and between 1.4% and 10.8% for the other CGUs. The average operating margins applied in the projected periods ranged between (0.4)% and 2.3% for the
CGUs of our online business and between 3.1% and 6.0% for the other CGUs. The terminal value to extrapolate cash flows beyond the explicit forecast period
included one year of additional growth based on the long-term inflation expectations that ranged between 1.5% and 2.8% for the CGUs, no additional growth
was assumed thereafter.
Fair value less costs of disposal
Fair value represents the price that would be received for selling an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants and is generally measured by
using an income approach or a market approach. We have used discounted cash flow projections based on the assets’ highest and best use from a market
participants’ perspective; taking financial plans as approved by management as a base (level 3 valuation). The discounted cash flow projections cover a period
of five years. Fair value less costs of disposal is based on a post-tax calculation model and included the deferred tax position in the carrying amount and a
corresponding tax-related cash flow in the recoverable amount. The key assumptions for the discounted cash flow projections relate to discount rate, sales
growth and operating margin. The post-tax rates used to discount the projected cash flows reflect specific risks relating to relevant CGUs and are 6.0% for
Food Lion and Hannaford and 5.5% for Delhaize Belgium. The average annual compound sales growth rates applied in the projected periods ranged between
2.9% and 3.0% for the CGUs. The average operating margins applied in the projected periods ranged between 2.7% and 6.4% for the CGUs. The terminal
value to extrapolate cash flows beyond the explicit forecast period included one year of additional growth based on the long-term inflation expectations that
ranged between 1.8% and 2.4% for the CGUs, no additional growth was assumed thereafter.
Key assumptions and sensitivity analyses relating to cash-generating units to which a significant amount of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite useful
lives is allocated are as follows:

1 In 2016, the CGUs Hannaford, Food Lion and Delhaize Belgium were acquired by Ahold Delhaize. During the purchase price allocation, the fair value of these CGUs was determined based
on their respective business enterprise values by discounting the projected cash flows of these CGUs. There was no significant change to these projected cash flows after the merger date.
2 During the 2016 goodwill impairment test, a terminal value growth rate of 1.5% and a pre-tax discount rate of 6.8% was applied.

13 Intangible assets continued

Due to the recent acquisition in 2016, the headroom for Food Lion, Hannaford and Delhaize Belgium is limited. A sensitivity analysis indicates that the
recoverable amount of Food Lion, Hannaford and Delhaize Belgium would be equal to their carrying amount:
• if the operating margins of the CGUs in the projection period were reduced by 0.2%, 1.3% and 0.3%, respectively
• if the WACC rates used to discount cash flow projections of the CGUs were higher by 0.4%, 1.3% and 0.5%, respectively.
The recoverable amount of these CGUs would be sufficiently in excess of the carrying values if the growth rate (terminal value) for them was assumed to be 0%.
Lease-related intangible assets consist primarily of favorable operating lease contracts acquired in business acquisitions. Customer relationships consist
primarily of pharmacy scripts and customer lists recognized through the acquisition of bol.com in 2012. “Other” mainly includes intangible assets related to
relationships with franchisees and affiliates recognized in connection with the Ahold Delhaize merger, location development rights, deed restrictions and
similar assets. Included in “Other” is an intangible asset allocated to Stop & Shop New England with an indefinite useful life and a carrying value of €29 million
(2016: €33 million). The useful life of this asset is assessed to be indefinite since it relates to the land portion of an owned location. Intangible assets under
development relate mainly to software development.

14 Investments in joint ventures and associates

In 1992, Ahold Delhaize partnered with Jerónimo Martins, SGPS, S.A. in the joint venture JMR – Gestão de Empresas de Retalho, SGPS, S.A. (“JMR”).
Ahold Delhaize holds 49% of the shares in JMR and shares equal voting power on JMR’s board of directors with Jerónimo Martins, SGPS, S.A. JMR
operates food retail stores in Portugal under the brand name Pingo Doce.
Ahold Delhaize holds 51% of the shares in P.T. Lion Super Indo (“Super Indo”). Super Indo operates supermarkets in Indonesia. Although Ahold Delhaize
has a 51% investment in Super Indo, the Company cannot exercise its majority voting rights mainly due to (i) a quorum requirement for the Board of Directors
to decide on critical operating and financing activities and (ii) a requirement of unanimous affirmative decisions in the Board of Directors, on significant and
strategic investing and financing matters, such as budgets and business plans and any resolution on the allocation of profits and distribution of dividends.
Therefore, JMR and Super Indo are joint ventures and are accounted for using the equity method. There are no quoted market prices available.
Ahold Delhaize is also a partner in various smaller joint arrangements and associates that are individually not material to the Group.
Changes in the carrying amount of Ahold Delhaize’s interest in joint ventures and associates are as follows:

Commitments and contingent liabilities in respect of joint ventures and associates
Our JMR joint venture is involved in several tax proceedings initiated by the Portuguese tax authorities. These tax claims are contested by our JMR joint venture.
For these tax claims JMR issued several bank guarantees for an total amount of €63 million (Ahold Delhaize’s share: €31 million, based on ownership interest).
There are no other significant contingent liabilities or restrictions relating to the Company’s interest in the joint ventures and associates. The commitments are

Part of the self-insured risk is ceded under a reinsurance treaty, which is a pooling arrangement between unrelated companies. At the same time, Ahold
Delhaize assumes a share of the reinsurance treaty risks that is measured by Ahold Delhaize’s participation percentage in the treaty. The participation
percentage is the ratio of premium paid by Ahold Delhaize to the total premium paid by all treaty members. In connection with this pooling arrangement,
the Company recognizes reinsurance assets and reinsurance liabilities (see also Notes 18, 22 and 26) on its balance sheet. There were no significant gains
or losses related to this pooling arrangement during 2017 or 2016.
Of the non-current loans receivable, €32 million matures between one and five years and €23 million after five years (January 1, 2017: €25 million between one
and five years and €28 million after five years). The current portion of loans receivable of €3 million is included in Other receivables (January 1, 2017: €12 million)
(see Note 17).

In 2017, €1,352 million has been recognized as a write-off of inventories in the income statement (2016: €1,071 million). A portion of the value of inventories
written off is Ahold Delhaize’s best estimate based on significant assumptions applied to certain products measured using the retail method.

Receivables that were past due but not impaired relate to a number of independent customers for whom there is no recent history of default.
The concentration of credit risk with respect to receivables is limited, as the Company’s customer base and vendor base are large and unrelated.
The Company does not hold any significant collateral on its receivables. Management believes there is no further credit risk provision required in excess
of the normal individual and collective impairment assessment, based on the aging analysis performed as of December 31, 2017. For more information about
credit risk, see Note 30.

In 2016 the derivative financial instruments – current portion includes the interest and the cross-currency swaps related to GBP 250 notes. The remaining
notional redemption amount of GBP 250 million was due in March 2017 and the related swaps were settled on the same date (see Note 21).
The Available-for-sale financial assets relate primarily to investments in U.S. Treasury bond funds which are held by one of the Company’s captive insurance
companies (see Note 24).
As of December 31, 2017, short-term deposits and similar instruments included short-term investments with a maturity at acquisition of between three and
12 months. Of the short-term deposits and similar instruments as of December 31, 2017, €9 million was restricted (January 1, 2017: €10 million). The restricted
investments are held for insurance purposes for U.S. workers’ compensation and general liability programs.
In 2016 the line item “Other” includes cash collateral posted on net liability positions of derivative financial instruments.
At each reporting date, the Company assesses whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired. In both 2017
and 2016, none of the financial assets were either past due or impaired.

Of the cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2017, €39 million was restricted (January 1, 2017: €42 million) and consisted of collateral in connection
with third-party money transfer services provided at our stores of €26 million (January 1, 2017: €29 million) as well as cash held in escrow accounts mainly
related to pending litigation, obligations related to business disposals and construction activities.
Cash and cash equivalents include €1,367 million (January 1, 2017: €1,184 million) held under a notional cash pooling arrangement. This cash amount was
fully offset by an identical amount included under Other current financial liabilities. From an operational perspective, the balances in the cash pool are netted.
However, in accordance with the guidance of IAS 32 regarding the offsetting of debit and credit balances for financial reporting purposes, these balances
have to be presented on a gross basis on the balance sheet (see Notes 26 and 30).
Ahold Delhaize’s banking arrangements allow the Company to fund outstanding checks when presented to the bank for payment. This cash management
practice may result in a net cash book overdraft position, which occurs when the total issued checks exceed available cash balances within the Company’s
cash concentration structure. Such book overdrafts are classified in accounts payable and amounted to €172 million and €217 million as of December 31, 2017,
and January 1, 2017, respectively. No right to offset with other bank balances exists for these book overdraft positions.

In addition, Ahold Delhaize has cumulative preferred financing shares outstanding. These cumulative preferred financing shares are considered debt under
IFRS until the date that Ahold Delhaize receives irrevocable notification from a holder of the shares to convert them into common shares. Upon this notification,
the cumulative preferred financing shares are classified as a separate class of equity since they no longer meet the definition of a liability. For disclosures

Dividends on common shares
On April 12, 2017, the General Meeting of Shareholders approved the dividend over 2016 of €0.57 per common share (€720 million in the aggregate).
This dividend was paid on April 26, 2017. The Management Board, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, proposes that a dividend of €0.63 per common
share be paid in 2018 with respect to 2017. This dividend is subject to approval by the General Meeting of Shareholders and has not been included as a liability
on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017. The payment of this dividend will not have income tax consequences for the Company.
Capital repayment and reverse stock split
On March 14, 2016, the merger between Ahold and Delhaize, including a capital repayment and reverse stock split, was approved at an Extraordinary
General Meeting of Shareholders. The reverse stock split was recorded on July 18, 2016, by way of a consolidation of 17 issued common shares into
16 common shares, which reduced the total number of common shares outstanding by 48,507,004 shares. The capital repayment of €1.29 per remaining
share, €1,001 million in the aggregate (excluding transaction costs), was paid on July 21, 2016.
As consideration, Delhaize shareholders received 4.75 Ahold common shares for each issued and outstanding Delhaize common share, which increased
the number of common shares outstanding by 496,000,577 shares.

Share buyback
The share buyback program of €1 billion that started on January 9, 2017, was successfully completed on December 29, 2017. In total 55,166,939 of the
Company's own shares were repurchased at an average price of €18.13 per share. The trades executed on December 28 and December 29, 2017,
totaling 328,631 shares, were settled on January 2 and January 3, 2018, respectively. On January 2, 2018, the Company commenced the €2 billion
share buyback program that was announced on November 8, 2017. The program is expected to be completed before the end of 2018.
Conversion of cumulative preferred financing shares
On August 9, 2017, Ahold Delhaize converted 45,000,000 cumulative preferred financing shares into 2,515,827 common shares. The 45,000,000 cumulative
preferred financing shares had a par value of €42,541,895.
Share-based payments
Share-based payments recognized in equity in the amount of €83 million (2016: €74 million) relate to the 2017 Global Reward Opportunity (GRO) share-based
compensation expenses (see Note 32) and the associated current and deferred income taxes.
Cumulative preferred shares
The Company’s Articles of Association provide for the possible issuance of cumulative preferred shares. The Company believes that its ability to issue this class
of shares could prevent, or at least delay, an attempt by a potential bidder to make a hostile takeover bid. According to Dutch law, a response device is limited
in time and therefore cannot permanently block a take-over of the Company concerned. Instead, it aims to facilitate an orderly process in which the interests of
the continuity of the Company, its shareholders and other stakeholders are safeguarded in the best way possible.
Moreover, outside the scope of a public offer, but also under other circumstances, the ability to issue this class of shares may safeguard the interests of
the Company and all stakeholders in the Company and resist influences that might conflict with those interests by affecting the Company’s continuity,
independence or identity. No cumulative preferred shares were outstanding as of December 31, 2017 or during 2017 and 2016.
In March 1989, the Company entered into an agreement with Stichting Continuïteit Ahold Delhaize (SCAD, previously named Stichting Ahold Continuïteit)
as amended and restated in April 1994, March 1997, December 2001, and December 2003 (the Option Agreement). Pursuant to the Option Agreement,
SCAD has been granted an option for no consideration to acquire cumulative preferred shares from the Company from time to time until December 2018.
At Ahold Delhaize, a decision to extend the Option Agreement is at the discretion of the Management Board, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board.
In December 2017, the Company and SCAD commenced discussions on a possible extension of the Option Agreement, in accordance with its terms which
require such discussions to start at least one year prior to the expiration date. No conclusion has been reached at this time.
The Option Agreement entitles SCAD, under certain circumstances, to acquire cumulative preferred shares from the Company up to a total par value that
is equal to the total par value of all issued and outstanding shares of Ahold Delhaize’s share capital, excluding cumulative preferred shares, at the time
of exercising the option. If the authorized share capital of the Company is amended during the term of the option, the Option Agreement provides for a
corresponding change of the total par value of cumulative preferred shares under option. The holders of the cumulative preferred shares are entitled to one
vote per share and a cumulative dividend expressed as a percentage of the amount called-up and paid-in to purchase the cumulative preferred shares.
The percentage to be applied is the sum of (1) the average basic refinancing transaction interest rate as set by the European Central Bank – measured by the
number of days during which that rate was in force in the fiscal year over which the dividend is paid – plus 2.1%, and (2) the average interest surcharge rate –
measured by the number of days during which that rate was in force in the fiscal year over which the dividend is paid – that would be charged by the largest
credit institution in the Netherlands (based on the balance sheet total as of the close of the fiscal year immediately preceding the fiscal year over which the
dividend is paid). The minimum percentage to be applied is 5.75%. Subject to limited exceptions, any potential transfer of cumulative preferred shares requires
the approval of the Management Board. Cumulative preferred shares can only be issued in a registered form. The Company may stipulate that only 25% of the
par value will be paid upon subscription to cumulative preferred shares until payment in full is later required by the Company. SCAD would then only be entitled
to a market-based interest return on its investment.

SCAD is a foundation organized under the laws of the Netherlands. Its purpose under its articles is to safeguard the interests of the Company and all
stakeholders in the Company and to resist, to the best of its ability, influences that might conflict with those interests by affecting the Company’s continuity,
independence or identity. SCAD seeks to realize its objectives by acquiring and holding cumulative preferred shares and by exercising the rights attached
to these shares, including the voting rights. The SCAD board has four members, who are appointed by the board of SCAD itself.
If the board of SCAD considers acquiring cumulative preferred shares or exercising voting rights on cumulative preferred shares, it will make an independent
assessment and, pursuant to Dutch law, it must ensure that its actions are proportional and reasonable. If SCAD acquires cumulative preferred shares, it will
only hold them for a limited period of time. These principles are in line with Dutch law, which only allows response measures that are proportionate, reasonable
and limited in time. In the case of liquidation, the SCAD board will decide on the use of any remaining residual assets.
Legal reserves
In accordance with the Dutch Civil Code and statutory requirements in other countries, legal reserves have to be established in certain circumstances.
Legal reserves are not available for distribution to the Company’s shareholders. The currency translation reserve, cash flow hedging reserve and other
reserves include non-distributable amounts. Of the total equity as per December 31, 2017, of €15,170 million, an amount of €346 million is non-distributable
(January 1, 2017: €1,130 million out of total equity of €16,276 million). See Note 10 to the parent company financial statements for more detail on the
legal reserves.

1 During 2005, the Company bought back GBP 250 million of the notes. The remaining notional amount of the GBP 250 million was swapped to U.S. dollars (see Note 30 for additional information), which
were due in March 2017.
2 Acquired through business combinations (refer to Note 4).
3 The weighted average interest rate for the financing obligations amounted to 7.5% as of the end of 2017 (2016: 7.6%).
4 Mortgages payable are collateralized by buildings and land. The weighted average interest rate for these mortgages payable amounted to 5.6% as of the end of 2017 (2016: 5.4%).

On September 12, 2017, Ahold Delhaize issued a new €750 million seven-year Eurobond. The bonds were sold at an issue price of 99.474% and carry an
annual coupon of 0.875%. The senior unsecured bonds will mature on September 19, 2024. The net proceeds of the offering will be used to refinance existing
debt and for general corporate purposes. The bonds are listed on Euronext Amsterdam.

On July 4, 2017, Ahold Delhaize successfully established a multi-currency euro-commercial paper program, in order to diversify its sources of financing.
Under this program, Ahold Delhaize may issue, from time to time, euro-commercial paper notes at blended rates. The outstanding principal amount of the
notes will not exceed €1 billion (or its equivalent in other currencies) at any time. No borrowings were outstanding as per December 31, 2017.
On March 14, 2017, Ahold Delhaize repaid the remaining notional redemption amount of GBP 250 million relating to the GBP 500 million notes. The related
swaps were settled on the same date. Since Ahold Delhaize was required under these swap contracts to redeem the notional amount through semi-annual
installments that commenced in September 2004, the net cash impact of the debt repayment and the swap settlement at maturity was limited to only the last
semiannual installment amounting to $14 million. With the repayment of its GBP 500 million notes, Ahold Delhaize no longer had any notes outstanding under
its Euro Medium Term Note Program and decided not to extend the program. Accordingly, the related Base Prospectus of April 21, 2016, which was valid for
a period of 12 months, has not been renewed.
The fair values of financial instruments, corresponding derivatives, and the foreign exchange and interest rate risk management policies applied by Ahold
Delhaize are disclosed in Note 30.
Credit facilities
Ahold Delhaize has access to a €1.0 billion committed, unsecured, multi-currency and syndicated credit facility that was amended and extended in February
2015, whereby the Company reduced the size of the credit facility from €1.2 billion to €1.0 billion (providing for the issuance of $275 million in letters of
credit). At the same time, the facility was extended to 2020 with two potential extensions after 12 and 24 months that would take the facility to 2021 and
2022 respectively. The Company successfully agreed on both extensions with the lenders. The credit facility contains customary covenants and is subject
to a financial covenant that requires Ahold Delhaize, in the event that its corporate rating from Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s is lower than BBB / Baa2,
respectively, not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio of 4.0:1. During 2017 and 2016, the Company was in compliance with these covenants. As of December
31, 2017, there were no outstanding borrowings under the facility other than letters of credit to an aggregate amount of $156 million (€130 million).
Ahold Delhaize also has access to a total of €395 million in uncommitted credit facilities to cover working capital requirements, issuance of guarantees and
letters of credit, of which €67 million was utilized as of December 31, 2017.

Finance lease liabilities are principally for buildings. Terms range primarily from 10 to 25 years and include renewal options if it is reasonably certain, at the
inception of the leases, that they will be exercised. At the time of entering into a finance lease agreement, the commitment is recorded at its present value using
the interest rate implicit in the lease, if this is practicable to determine; if not, the local brand-specific interest rate applicable for long-term borrowings is used.
As of December 31, 2017, the finance lease liabilities are recorded at their present value at a weighted average interest rate of 6.3% (January 1, 2017: 7.1%).
Certain store leases provide for contingent additional rentals based on a percentage of sales and consumer price indices. Substantially all of the store leases
have renewal options for additional terms. None of Ahold Delhaize’s leases impose restrictions on Ahold Delhaize’s ability to pay dividends, incur additional
debt or enter into additional leasing arrangements.
During 2017, interest expense on finance lease liabilities was €111 million (2016: €111 million). Total future minimum sublease income expected to be received
under non-cancellable subleases as of December 31, 2017, is €106 million (January 1, 2017: €111 million). The total contingent rent expense recognized during
the year on finance leases was €1 million expense (2016: €1 million expense).

The cumulative preferred financing shares were issued in four tranches. Dividends are paid on each preferred financing share at a percentage (financing
dividend percentage) that differs per tranche. When a period of 10 years has lapsed after the issue date of a tranche, and every 10 years thereafter (reset date),
the financing dividend percentage is reset. The current financing dividend percentage is 1.527% per year for the shares issued in June 1996, 6.08% per year
for the shares issued in August 1998, 3.85% per year for the shares issued in October 2000, and 3.35% per year for the shares issued in December 2003.
On August 9, 2017, at the request of the holder of these shares, Ahold Delhaize converted 45,000,000 cumulative preferred financing shares into 2,515,827
common shares. The remaining 42,484,173 cumulative preferred financing shares were delivered to Ahold Delhaize by SAPFAA. The 45,000,000 cumulative
preferred financing shares had a par value of €42,541,895. The nominal value plus additional paid-in capital per tranche is €29 million (June 1996 tranche),
€46 million (August 1998 tranche), €320 million (October 2000 tranche) and €60 million (December 2003 tranche); in the aggregate €455 million. This amount
is presented under “Other non-current financial liabilities” in the consolidated balance sheet as these cumulative preferred financing shares are considered
debt under IFRS.
The total number of votes that can be exercised by the cumulative preferred financing shares is approximately 68 million. This represents approximately 5% of
the total number of votes that can be cast (this total being calculated as the sum of the outstanding cumulative preferred financing shares and the outstanding
common shares).
The cumulative preferred financing shares are convertible into common shares. The conversion conditions have been set so as to avoid any transfer of value
from the common shares to the cumulative preferred financing shares. The maximum number of common shares to be received upon conversion of all
outstanding cumulative preferred financing shares is approximately 90 million. The conversion features are similar for all tranches. Conversion is allowed for
all shares in one tranche held by one investor but not for fractions of tranches held by one investor. Upon conversion, the holders of (depositary receipts of)
cumulative preferred financing shares will receive a number of common shares that is calculated by dividing the value of the cumulative preferred financing
shares on the day before the conversion date by the average share price of Ahold Delhaize common shares on the five trading days preceding the notification
date, on the notification date, and on the four trading days following the notification date. The value of the cumulative preferred financing shares will be
considered, for this purpose, to be equal to the lower of the nominal value plus the additional paid-in capital of the cumulative preferred financing shares
(par value) or to the present value of the remaining preferred dividends until the first reset date plus the present value of the par value at the first reset date.
Subject to the approval of the General Meeting of Shareholders, the Company can redeem the cumulative preferred financing shares of a certain tranche,
but not fractions of a tranche. Redemption of a tranche is subject to the approval of the holders of depositary receipts of that tranche, unless all (remaining)
cumulative preferred financing shares are redeemed. Redemption takes place at the higher of the par value or the present value of the remaining preferred
dividends plus the present value of the par value at the reset date.

23 Pensions and other post-employment benefits

Defined benefit plans
Ahold Delhaize has a number of defined benefit pension plans covering a substantial number of employees, former employees and retirees in the Netherlands,
the United States, Belgium, Greece and Serbia.
In the Netherlands, the Company has a career average plan covering all employees over the age of 21. The plan provides benefits to participants or
beneficiaries upon retirement, death or disability. The assets of the plan, which are made up of contributions from Ahold Delhaize and the employees, are
managed by Ahold Pensioenfonds, an independent foundation. The contributions are established in a funding agreement between Ahold Delhaize, employee
representatives, and Ahold Pensioenfonds every five years based on the funding levels of the plan. The contributions are determined as a percentage of an
employee’s pensionable salary.
In the United States, the Company maintains a funded plan covering employees at Ahold USA. This plan is closed to new participants. The plan provides
a life annuity benefit based upon final pay to participants or beneficiaries upon retirement, death or disability. The assets of the plan, which are made up of
contributions from Ahold Delhaize, are maintained with various trustees. Contributions to the plan are required under the current funding policy if the prior
year-end funding ratio falls below 100% as measured using regulatory interest rates without funding relief in order to avoid variable Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation (PBGC) premiums. In addition, the Company provides additional pension benefits for certain Company executives and life insurance and
medical care benefits for certain retired employees meeting age and service requirements at its U.S. subsidiaries, all of which the Company funds as claims
are incurred.
In Belgium, the Company sponsors plans for substantially all of its employees. The plans are funded by fixed monthly contributions from both the Company
and employees. The contributions are adjusted annually according to the Belgian consumer price index; however, certain employees who were employed
before 2005 were able to choose not to participate in the employee contribution part of the plan. The plans assure the employees a lump-sum payment at
retirement based on the contributions made, and provide employees with death-in-service benefits. Belgian law prescribes a variable minimum guaranteed
rate of return with Belgian 10-year government bonds as the underlying benchmark, and a collar of 1.75% and 3.75%. The Company substantially insures these
returns with external insurance companies that receive and manage the contributions to the plans. According to the relevant legislation, a short-fall only needs
to be compensated by the employer at the point in time when the employee either retires or leaves the Company. As these plans have defined benefit features
(when the return provided by the insurance company can be below the legally required minimum return, in which case the employer has to cover the gap with
additional contributions), the Company treats these plans as defined benefit plans.
Additionally in Belgium, the Company maintains a plan covering Company executives that provides lump-sum benefits to participants upon death or retirement
based on a formula applied to the last annual salary of the participant before his or her retirement or death. The plan is subject to the legal requirement
to guarantee a minimum return on the contributions. The assets of the plan, which are made up of the contributions, are managed through a fund that is
administered by an independent insurance company, providing a minimum guaranteed return. The plan participant’s contributions are defined in the terms of
the plan, while the annual contributions to be paid by the Company are determined based on the funding level of the plan and are calculated based on current
salaries, taking into account the legal minimum funding requirement, which is based on the vested reserves to which employees are entitled upon retirement or
death. The plan mainly invests in debt securities in order to achieve the required minimum return. The Company bears any risk above the minimum guarantee
given by the insurance company. There are no asset ceiling restrictions.
In Greece, the Company operates an unfunded defined benefit post-employment plan. This plan relates to retirement benefits prescribed by Greek law,
consisting of lump-sum compensation payable in case of normal retirement or termination of employment. The amount of the indemnity is based on an
employee’s monthly earnings and a multiple depending on the length of service and the status of the employee. There is no legal requirement to fund these
plans with contributions or other plan assets. Employees participate in the plan once they have completed a minimum service period, which is generally
one year.

23 Pensions and other post-employment benefits continued

In Serbia, the Company has an unfunded defined benefit plan that provides a lump-sum benefit upon retirement of the employee, as prescribed by
Serbian law. The benefit is based on a fixed multiple of the higher of the (i) average gross salary of the employee, (ii) average gross salary in the Company
or (iii) average gross salary in the country, each determined at the time the employee retires. There is no legal requirement to fund these plans with contributions
or other plan assets.
The pension plans expose the Company to actuarial risks such as: longevity risk, interest rate risk, currency risk, salary risk and investment risk. Longevity risk
relates to the mortality assumptions used to value the defined benefit obligation, where an increase in participants’ life expectancies will increase a plan’s
liability. Interest rate risk relates to the discount rate used to value the defined benefit obligation, where a decrease in the discount rate will increase a plan’s
liability; however this will be partially offset by an increase in the return on a plan’s investments in debt instruments. The pension plans may mitigate interest
rate risk by entering into interest rate swap contracts. Currency risk relates to the fact that a plan holds investments that may not be denominated in the same
currency as the plan’s obligations. The pension plans may mitigate currency risk by purchasing forward currency instruments. Salary risk relates to salary
increase assumptions used to value the defined benefit obligation, where an increase will result in a higher plan liability. See below for more details on the
Company’s asset-liability matching strategy employed to manage its investment risk.
Net defined benefit cost is comprised of the following components. The net interest (income) expense is presented within net financial expenses in the income
statement and plan remeasurements are presented as other comprehensive income. All other components of net defined benefit cost are presented in the
income statement as cost of sales, selling expenses, and general and administrative expenses, depending on the functional areas of the employees earning
the benefits.

During 2017, Ahold Delhaize decided to transition a select population of employees participating in its defined benefit pension plan in the United States to
a defined contribution plan, effective January 1, 2020. Accrued benefits under the defined benefit plan for these employees will be frozen as of December
31, 2019. The resulting curtailment gain recognized in 2017 of €28 million has been partially offset by accrued transition contributions of €3 million that the
Company will make in 2020 to compensate affected employees for the benefit freeze.
During 2017, Ahold Delhaize purchased annuity contracts to settle benefits in the defined benefit pension plan in the United States for participants that are
currently receiving monthly payments of less than $500. This has resulted in a settlement of €123 million of the defined benefit obligation. The settlement of
this obligation was funded with €124 million of plan assets and resulted in a €1 million gain on settlement being recognized within pension expense in the
income statement.
During 2017, Ahold Delhaize amended its defined benefit plan in the Netherlands. The amendments involved raising the retirement age from 67 to 68, in
accordance with Dutch fiscal regulations, and converting the remaining conditional service requirement for early retirement benefits to become unconditional.
The effect of these amendments was a net past service cost in the income statement of €12 million.
During 2016, Ahold Delhaize changed its policy of accounting for employee contributions to its defined benefit plan in the Netherlands. Previously, employee
contributions were attributed to the periods of future service when measuring the defined benefit obligation; now they are considered to be a reduction of
service costs in the period in which the related service is rendered. This change in policy increased the funded status of the plan by €28 million, which has
been recognized in Other comprehensive income.
Cash contributions
From 2017 to 2018, Company contributions are expected to decrease from €137 million to €101 million in the Netherlands, decrease from $58 million
(€51 million) to $31 million (€26 million) for all defined benefit plans in the United States, and decrease from €17 million to €15 million for all plans in the rest
of the world.
As of year-end 2017, the funding ratio, calculated in accordance with regulatory requirements, of the Dutch plan was 110%. Under the financing agreement
with the Dutch pension fund, contributions are made as a percentage of employees’ salaries and shared between Ahold Delhaize and the employees.
The agreement also allows for a reduction in premiums if certain funding conditions are met. In addition, Ahold Delhaize can be required to contribute a
maximum amount of €150 million over a five-year period if the funding ratio is below 105%. At year-end 2016, the funding ratio was 104% and the Company and
Ahold Pensioenfonds agreed to an additional funding of €28 million under the financing agreement, which has been included in the 2017 cash contributions.
The Ahold USA pension plan’s funding ratio at year-end 2017 was 119%, measured using regulatory interest rates allowed by the U.S. government as part of
funding relief, which are higher than otherwise would be allowed. Under the current funding policy, an $8 million (€7 million) contribution is expected to be made
to the Ahold USA pension plan in 2018.

The calculations of the defined benefit obligation and net defined benefit cost are sensitive to the assumptions set out below. These assumptions require
a large degree of judgment. Actual experience may differ from the assumptions made. The assumptions required to calculate the actuarial present value

The above sensitivity analyses have been based on a change in each respective assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In reality, one
might expect interrelationships between the assumptions, especially between discount rate and future salary increases as both depend to a certain extent on
expected inflation rates. The methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analyses did not change compared to the previous period.

Virtually all equity and debt instruments have quoted prices in active markets. Derivatives can be classified as level 2 instruments, and real estate and some
investment funds as level 3 instruments based on the definitions in IFRS 13, “Fair Value Measurement.” It is the policy of the Dutch pension plan to use interest
rate swaps to partially hedge its exposure to interest rate risk on the pension liability. Foreign currency exposures are hedged by the use of forward foreign
exchange contracts.
In the Netherlands, the plan assets are managed by outside investment managers following investment strategies based on the composition of the plan
liabilities. With the aid of asset liability management modeling, analyses are made of possible future economic scenarios and investment portfolios. Based on
these analyses, investment strategies are determined to produce optimal investment returns at acceptable funding ratio risk levels. Less favorable years can
be part of these scenarios. Currently, the strategic targets for asset allocation of the Dutch pension plan are: 40% variable yield and 60% fixed income.

In the United States, the plan assets are managed by outside investment managers and rebalanced periodically. The committees for the various U.S.
plans establish investment policies and strategies and regularly monitor the performance of the assets, including the selection of investment managers, setting
long-term strategic targets and monitoring asset allocations. Target allocation ranges are guidelines, not limitations, subject to variation from time to time or
as circumstances warrant. Occasionally, the committees may approve allocations above or below a target range. Pension plan assets are invested in a trust
intended to comply with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), as amended, and applicable fiduciary standards. The long-term
investment objective for the plan’s assets is to maintain an acceptable funding ratio of the plan’s assets and liabilities without undue exposure to risk. Currently,
the strategic targets are: 35% equity securities, 45% debt securities and 20% other investments.
In 2017, the Dutch plan had €1.3 million of plan assets invested in Ahold Delhaize’s financial instruments (2016: €1.2 million). In 2017 or 2016, the U.S. plans did
not have any plan assets invested in Ahold Delhaize financial instruments.
The actual return on plan assets in 2017 was 3.0% for the Dutch plan (2016: 10.7%) and 15.5% for the Ahold USA pension plan (2016: 6.1%).
Benefit maturities
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligations of the plans in the Netherlands, U.S., and the rest of world are 25.6, 14.9, and 11.4 years,
respectively.
The expected schedule of benefit payments for the plans are as follows.

Defined contribution plans
The Company operates defined contribution plans in the Netherlands, United States, Belgium, Greece and the Czech Republic. As mentioned above, the
defined contribution plans in Belgium are accounted for as defined benefit plans due to the guaranteed return elements of the plans. The largest defined
contribution plans exist in the United States, where the Company sponsors profit-sharing retirement plans that include a 401(k) feature that permits participating
employees to make elective deferrals of their compensation and requires the Company to make matching contributions.
During 2017 and 2016, the Company contributed €85 million and €63 million, respectively, to its defined contribution plans. These contributions were
recognized as an expense in the income statement and related entirely to continuing operations in 2017 and 2016.

Multi-employer plans
A significant number of union employees in the United States are covered by multi-employer plans based on obligations arising from collective bargaining
agreements. These plans provide retirement and other benefits to participants generally based on their service to contributing employers. The benefits are
paid from assets held in trust for that purpose. Trustees are appointed in equal number by employers and unions and they are typically responsible for
oversight of the investment of the assets and administration of the plan. Contribution rates and, in some instances, benefit levels are generally determined
through the collective bargaining process between the participating employers and unions. None of the Company’s collective bargaining agreements require
that a minimum funding requirement exists for these plans.
Most of these plans are defined contribution plans. All plans that are defined benefit plans, on the basis of the terms of the benefits provided, are accounted
for as defined contribution plans because, among other things, there is insufficient information available to account for these plans as defined benefit plans.
These plans are generally flat dollar benefit plans. Ahold Delhaize is only one of several employers participating in most of these plans and in the event that
Ahold Delhaize withdraws from a plan, its allocable share of the plan’s obligations (with certain exceptions) is based upon unfunded vested benefits in the
plan at the time of such withdrawal. Ahold Delhaize’s obligation to pay for its allocable share of a plan’s unfunded vested benefits is called a withdrawal liability.
The withdrawal liability payable by Ahold Delhaize at such time as it experiences a withdrawal from a plan, is based upon the applicable statutory formula,
plan computation methods and actuarial assumptions, and the amount of the plan’s unfunded benefits as of the date of the withdrawal. Ahold Delhaize does
not have sufficient information to accurately determine its ratable share of plan obligations and assets following defined benefit accounting principles and the
financial statements of the multi-employer plans are drawn up on the basis of other accounting policies than those applied by Ahold Delhaize. Consequently,
these multi-employer plans are not included in the Company’s balance sheet.
The risks of participating in multi-employer plans are different from the risks of single employer plans. Ahold Delhaize’s contributions are pooled with the
contributions of other contributing employers, and are therefore used to provide benefits to employees of such other participating employers. If other
participating employers cease to participate in the plan without paying their allocable portion of the plan’s unfunded obligations, this could result in increases
in the amount of the plan’s unfunded benefits and, thus, Ahold Delhaize’s future contributions. Similarly, if a number of employers cease to have employees
participating in the plan, Ahold Delhaize could be responsible for an increased share of the plan’s deficit. If Ahold Delhaize seeks to withdraw from a multiemployer plan, it must obtain the agreement of the applicable unions and, in connection therewith, it will likely be required to pay a withdrawal liability. In the
event a multi-employer plan in which Ahold Delhaize participates becomes insolvent, Ahold Delhaize may be required to increase its contributions, in certain
circumstances, to fund the payment of benefits by such multi-employer plan.

Defined benefit plans
Ahold Delhaize participates in 11 multi-employer pension plans that are defined benefit plans on the basis of the terms of the benefits provided. The estimate
of the Company’s net proportionate share of the plans’ deficits is based on the latest available information received from these plans, such as the plans’
measurement of plan assets and the use of discount rates between 6.5% and 8.0%. The Company’s participation in these multi-employer plans is outlined
in the following tables. The EIN / Pension Plan Number column provides the Employer Identification Number (EIN) and the three-digit pension plan number.
Multi-employer pension plans, similar to all pension plans, in the U.S. are regulated by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), as
amended, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA), and the Multi-employer Pension Reform Act of 2014 (MPRA) among other legislation. Under the PPA,
plans are categorized as “endangered” (Yellow Zone), “seriously endangered” (Orange Zone), “critical” (Red Zone), or neither endangered nor critical
(Green Zone), primarily based on three measures: the plan’s funded percentage, the number of years before the plan is projected to have a minimum funding
deficiency under ERISA and the number of years before the plan is projected to become insolvent. A plan is in the “Yellow Zone” if the funded percentage
is less than 80% or a minimum funding deficiency is projected within seven years. If both of these triggers are reached, the plan is in the “Orange Zone.”
Generally, a plan is in the “Red Zone” if a funding deficiency is projected at any time in the next four years (or five years if the funded percentage is less than
65%). Plans with a funding ratio above 80% are designated as being in the “Green Zone.” Multi-employer plans in endangered or critical status are required
by U.S. law to develop either a funding improvement plan (FIP) or a rehabilitation plan (RP) to enhance funding through reductions in benefits, increases in
contributions, or both. The FIP / RP Status Pending / Implemented column in the table below indicates plans for which an FIP or an RP is pending or has been
implemented. Additional information regarding the multi-employer plans listed in the following tables can be found on the website of the U.S. Department of
Labor (www.efast.dol.gov).

If the underfunded liabilities of the multi-employer pension plans are not reduced, either by improved market conditions, reduction in benefits, or collective
bargaining changes, increased future payments by the Company and the other participating employers may result. However, all future increases will be
subject to the collective bargaining process. In 2018, the Company expects its contributions to decrease to €80 million. Ahold Delhaize has a risk of increased
contributions and withdrawal liability if any of the participating employers in an underfunded multi-employer plan withdraw from the plan or become insolvent
and are no longer able to meet their contribution requirements or if the multi-employer plan itself no longer has sufficient assets available to fund its short-term
obligations to the participants in the plan. Any adjustment for a withdrawal liability will be recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and the amount
can be reasonably estimated. Except for the UFCW Local #338 withdrawal liability payment mentioned below, no other withdrawal payments were incurred
or included in the 2017 and 2016 contributions disclosed above.
During 2015, Stop & Shop reached an agreement with UFCW Local #338 whereby Stop & Shop was allowed to withdraw from the pension plan. The withdrawal
occurred in September 2015 and resulted in a $12 million (€11 million) withdrawal liability. The settlement of the liability was made in installments, with $6 million
paid at the time of withdrawal and the second and third installments, of $3 million each, paid in May and October of 2016.
Defined contribution plans
Ahold Delhaize also participates in 39 multi-employer plans that are defined contribution plans on the basis of the terms of the benefits provided. The majority
of these plans provide health and welfare benefits. The Company contributed €264 million and €276 million to multi-employer defined contribution plans
during 2017 and 2016, respectively. These contributions are recognized as an expense in the consolidated income statement and related entirely to continuing
operations in 2017 and 2016. These plans vary significantly in size, with contributions to the three largest plans representing 52% of total contributions.

Self-insurance program
Ahold Delhaize is self-insured for certain potential losses, mainly relating to general liability, vehicle liability, workers’ compensation and property losses incurred
by its subsidiaries. The maximum self-insurance retention per occurrence, including defense costs, is $2 million (€2 million) for general liability, $5 million
(€4 million) for commercial vehicle liability, $5 million (€4 million) for workers’ compensation, and $10 million (€8 million) and $5 million (€4 million) for property
losses in the U.S. and Europe, respectively. Part of the self-insured risk is ceded under a reinsurance treaty, which is a pooling arrangement between unrelated
companies; see Note 15.
The measurement of the self-insurance provisions involves the following estimates and judgments to be made regarding future claim patterns, which include
estimates on the number of future claims, timing and amount of payment of damages, and costs associated with the settlement of future claims.

24 Provisions continued

Loyalty programs
This provision relates to a third-party customer loyalty program in the Netherlands and reflects the estimated cost of benefits to which customers participating
in the loyalty program are entitled. When measuring the provision for loyalty programs, management estimates the expected timing of the redemptions by
customers and the expected breakage (benefits granted but never redeemed).
Claims and legal disputes
The Company is a party to a number of legal proceedings arising out of its business operations. Such legal proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties.
Management, supported by internal and external legal counsel, where appropriate, determines whether it is probable that an outflow of resources will be
required to settle an obligation. If this is the case, the best estimate of the outflow of resources is recognized.
Severance and termination benefits
This provision relates to payments to employees whose employment with the Company has ended, either as part of a restructuring or a voluntary separation
plan. The measurement of the provision involves estimates and judgments about the population and number of employees that will ultimately be affected by
the plans, estimates of salary ranges used to measure future cash flows, and assumptions of periods of service, if relevant. The current year additions to the
provision relate mainly to benefits offered to employees affected by the creation of the brand-centric organization and other restructurings in the U.S., as well
as a restructuring of the supply chain in Belgium.
Onerous contracts
Onerous contract provisions relate to unfavorable contracts where the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contracts exceed the benefits
expected to be received. The judgments and estimates made in the measurement of onerous contracts relate to future costs anticipated to be incurred and
any potential remedies available, for instance renegotiation with landlords, assignment of leases and subleasing possibilities. The current year Other movement
amount represents the reclassification of finance lease liability balances with their related onerous contract costs.
Other
Other provisions include long-term incentives, jubilee payments, asset retirement obligations, provisions for environmental risks, and supplemental medical
benefits. The judgments and estimates made in the measurement of these provisions relate to the estimated costs to be incurred at an unknown future date.

Step rent accruals relate to the equalization of rent payments from lease contracts with scheduled fixed rent increases throughout the life of the contract.
Unfavorable lease obligations are recognized as part of a business combination and represent the present value of the excess of contracted rent payments
over the market rents as measured on the date of the acquisition. The obligation is released to rent expense on a straight-line basis over the remaining term
of the lease.
Deferred income predominantly represents the non-current portions of deferred income on vendor allowances and deferred gains on sale and
leaseback transactions.

30 Financial risk management and financial instruments

Financial risk management
Ahold Delhaize is exposed to a variety of financial risks including currency, interest rate, funding, liquidity, and counterparty risks. The financial risk
management is centralized through the Treasury function which operates within a framework of policies and procedures that is reviewed regularly.
Ahold Delhaize’s Management Board has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Treasury risk management framework.
Ahold Delhaize’s management reviews material changes to Treasury policies and receives information related to Treasury activities. The Treasury function
does not operate as a profit center and manages the financial risks that arise in relation to underlying business needs.
In accordance with its Treasury policies, Ahold Delhaize uses derivative instruments solely for the purpose of hedging exposures. These exposures are mainly
the result of interest rate and currency risks arising from the Company’s operations and its sources of financing. Ahold Delhaize does not enter into derivative
financial instruments for speculative purposes. The transaction of derivative instruments is restricted to Treasury personnel only and Ahold Delhaize’s Internal
Control department reviews the Treasury internal control environment regularly.
Relationships with credit rating agencies and monitoring of key credit ratios are also managed by the Treasury department.
Currency risk
Ahold Delhaize operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from currency exposures, primarily with respect to the U.S. dollar.
Since Ahold Delhaize's subsidiaries primarily purchase and sell in local currencies, the Company’s exposure to exchange rate movements in its commercial
operations is naturally limited. The Company is subject to foreign currency exchange risks due to exchange rate movements in connection with the translation
of its foreign subsidiaries’ income, assets and liabilities into euros for inclusion in its consolidated financial statements. Translation risk related to Ahold
Delhaize’s foreign subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates is not actively hedged; however, the Company aims to minimize this exposure by funding its
foreign operations in their functional currency, wherever feasible.
To protect the value of future foreign currency cash flows, including loan and interest payments, lease payments, dividends and firm purchase commitments,
and the value of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency, Ahold Delhaize seeks to mitigate its foreign currency exchange exposure by borrowing
in local currency and entering into various financial instruments, including forward contracts and currency swaps. It is Ahold Delhaize’s policy to cover foreign
exchange transaction exposure in relation to existing assets, liabilities and firm purchase commitments.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
As of December 31, 2017, Ahold Delhaize carried out a sensitivity analysis with regard to changes in foreign exchange rates to revalue all monetary assets
and liabilities (including derivative financial instruments) in a currency other than the functional currency of the subsidiary in its balance sheet at year-end.
Assuming the euro had strengthened (weakened) by 10% against the U.S. dollar compared to the actual 2017 rate, with all other variables held constant, the
hypothetical result on income before income taxes would have been a decrease (increase) of €1 million (2016: nil), as a result of foreign exchange revaluation
of U.S. dollar-denominated cash and cash equivalents held by non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries.
Interest rate risk
Ahold Delhaize’s outstanding debt position is exposed to changes in interest rates. To manage interest rate risk, Ahold Delhaize has an interest rate
management policy aimed at reducing volatility in its interest expense and maintaining a target percentage of its debt in fixed-rate instruments. As of December
31, 2017, after taking into account the effect of interest rate swaps and cross-currency swaps, the entirety of Ahold Delhaize’s long-term debt was at fixed rates
of interest (2016: 100%).

Interest rate sensitivity analysis
The total interest expense recognized in the 2017 income statement related to the variable rates of long-term debt, net of swaps, amounted to nil
(2016: €2 million). An increase (decrease) in market interest rates by 25 basis points, with all other variables (including foreign exchange rates) held constant,
would have resulted in a loss (gain) of nil (2016: nil). In addition, a similar increase (decrease) in market interest rates would have resulted in a fair-value
gain of €6 million or a loss of €6 million, respectively (2016: a gain of €1 million or a loss of nil, respectively) on derivative hedges that do not qualify for
hedge accounting.
The total interest income recognized in the 2017 income statement amounted to €32 million (2016: €15 million), mainly related to variable rate money market fund
investments and deposits. The Company estimates that with a possible increase (decrease) of euro and U.S. dollar market interest rates of 25 basis points with
all other variables (including foreign exchange rates) held constant, this would have resulted in a gain of €5 million or a loss of €5 million, respectively (2016: gain
of €5 million or a loss of €5 million).
The above sensitivity analyses are for illustrative purposes only as, in practice, market rates rarely change in isolation from other factors that also affect Ahold
Delhaize’s financial position and results.
Credit risk
Ahold Delhaize has no significant concentrations of credit risk. Sales to retail customers are made in cash, checks and debit cards, or via major credit cards.
Sales to franchisees are done on credit. The concentration of credit risk with respect to receivables is limited, as the Company’s customer base and vendor
base are large and unrelated. As a result, management believes there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of the normal individual and collective
impairment, based on an aging analysis performed as of December 31, 2017. For further discussion on Ahold Delhaize’s receivables, see Notes 15 and 17.
Financial transactions are predominantly entered into with investment grade financial institutions. The Company requires a minimum short-term rating of
A1/P1 and a minimum long-term rating of A3/A- for its deposit and investment products. The Company may deviate from this requirement from time to time
for operational reasons. With respect to credit risk, derivative contracts with counterparties are entered into primarily under the standard terms and conditions
of the International Swap and Derivatives Association (ISDA). With certain counterparties, Ahold Delhaize has credit support annexes in place that materially
reduce the counterparty risk exposure as a result of contractual exchange of cash collateral. Ahold Delhaize has policies that limit the amount of counterparty
credit exposure to any single financial institution or investment vehicle and actively monitors these exposures.
Counterparty risk is measured by adding the nominal value of cash, short-term deposits and marketable securities, and the mark-to-market of derivative
instruments, netted with the collateral posted, if any. As a result, the highest exposure to a single financial counterparty, excluding AAA-rated money market
funds, on December 31, 2017, amounted to €307 million (January 1, 2017: €299 million).
Offsetting of financial instruments
Ahold Delhaize has several financial assets and financial liabilities that are subject to offsetting or enforceable master netting arrangements and
similar agreements.
Cash pool
The Company has implemented a cash pool system, allowing a more efficient management of the daily working capital needs of the participating operating
entities. The settlement mechanism of the cash pool is provided by an external financial counterparty. The cash pool system provides that the Company is
exposed to a single net amount with that financial counterparty rather than the gross amount of several current accounts and bank overdraft balances with
multiple financial counterparties. From an operational perspective the balances in the cash pool are netted. However, in accordance with the guidance of
IAS 32 regarding the offsetting of debit and credit balances for financial reporting purposes, these balances have to be presented on a gross basis on the
balance sheet (see Notes 19 and 26).

ISDA master agreements for derivatives
The Company has entered into several ISDA master agreements in connection with its derivative transactions. In general, under such agreements the amounts
owed by each counterparty to another on the same day in respect of the same transaction payable in the same currency are aggregated into a single net
amount that is payable by one party to the other.
Under certain circumstances if all transactions under the ISDA master agreement are terminated, e.g., when a credit event such as payment default occurs,
the termination value is assessed and only a single net amount is payable in the settlement of all transactions governed by the ISDA master agreement.
The ISDA agreements do not meet the criteria for offsetting in the balance sheet. This is because the Company does not currently have a legally enforceable
right to offset recognized amounts, because the right to offset is enforceable only on the occurrence of a future event such as a default. ISDAs are considered
to be master netting arrangements for IFRS 7 disclosure purposes.
The following table shows the maximum exposure of the Company’s financial assets and financial liabilities that are subject to offset or enforceable master
netting arrangements and similar agreements.

Liquidity risk
Ahold Delhaize views available cash balances and funds from operating activities as its primary sources of liquidity, complemented with access to external
sources of funds when deemed to be required. Ahold Delhaize manages short-term liquidity based on projected cash flows. As of December 31, 2017, the
Company’s liquidity position primarily consisted of €3,380 million of cash (including short-term deposits and similar instruments and the current portion of
assets available-for-sale, adjusted for cash held under a notional cash pooling arrangement), and the undrawn €1 billion revolving credit facility.
Based on the current operating performance and liquidity position, the Company believes that cash provided by operating activities and available cash
balances will be sufficient for working capital, capital expenditures, interest payments, dividends, the announced €2 billion share buyback program, and
scheduled debt repayments for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future. In addition, the Company has access to the amount available on its revolving
credit facility and to the debt capital markets based on its current credit ratings.
The following tables summarize the expected maturity profile of the Company’s financial liabilities (including derivatives) as of December 31, 2017, and
January 1, 2017, respectively, based on contractual undiscounted payments.
All financial liabilities held at the reporting date, for which payments are already contractually agreed, have been included. Amounts in foreign currency have
been translated using the reporting date closing rate. Cash flows arising from financial instruments carrying variable interest payments have been calculated
using the forward curve interest rates as of December 31, 2017, and January 1, 2017, respectively. See Note 34 for the liquidity risk related to guarantees.

(2018, 2020, 2023 and 2026). No liability redemption was assumed.

Credit ratings
Maintaining investment grade credit ratings is a cornerstone of Ahold Delhaize’s strategy because such ratings serve to lower the cost of funds and facilitate
access to a variety of lenders and markets. Ahold Delhaize’s current credit ratings from the solicited rating agencies are as follows:
• Standard & Poor’s: corporate credit rating BBB, with a stable outlook as of June 2009 (previous rating BBB- assigned in 2007).
• Moody’s: issuer credit rating Baa1, with a stable outlook as of February 2018 (previous rating Baa2 assigned in August 2015).
Capital risk management
The Company’s primary objective in terms of managing capital is the optimization of its debt and equity balances in order to sustain the future development
of the business, maintain its investment grade credit rating and maximize shareholder value.
Ahold Delhaize may balance its overall capital structure in a number of ways, including through the payment of dividends, capital repayment, new share issues
and share buybacks as well as the issuance of new debt or the redemption of existing debt.

Of Ahold Delhaize’s categories of financial instruments, only derivatives, assets available-for-sale and reinsurance assets (liabilities) are measured and
recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. These fair value measurements are categorized within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The Company uses
inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived from prices). The fair value
of derivative instruments is measured by using either a market or income approach (mainly present value techniques). Foreign currency forward contracts
are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates that match the maturity of the contracts. Interest rate
swaps are measured at the present value of expected future cash flows. Expected future cash flows are discounted by using the applicable yield curves
derived from quoted interest rates.

To the extent that no cash collateral is contractually required, the valuation of Ahold Delhaize’s derivative instruments is adjusted for the credit risk of
the counterparty, called Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA), and adjusted for Ahold Delhaize's own credit risk, called Debit Valuation Adjustment (DVA).
The valuation technique for the CVA / DVA calculation is based on relevant observable market inputs.
No CVA / DVA adjustments are made to the valuation of certain derivative instruments, for which both Ahold Delhaize and its counterparties are required to
post or redeem cash collaterals if the value of a derivative exceeds a threshold defined in the contractual provisions. Such cash collaterals materially reduce
the impact of both the counterparty and Ahold Delhaize’s own non-performance risk on the value of the instrument. The portion of outstanding derivatives that
was collateralized is specified as follows:

The carrying amount of trade and other (non-)current receivables, cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable, short-term deposits and similar instruments,
and other current financial assets and liabilities approximate their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments and, for receivables,
because any recoverability loss is reflected in an impairment loss. The fair values of quoted borrowings for which an active market exists are based on yearend quoted prices. The fair value of other non-derivative financial assets and liabilities that are not traded in an active market are estimated using discounted
cash flow analyses based on market rates prevailing at year-end. The fair value of the cumulative preferred financing shares is measured as the present value
of expected future cash flows. Such cash flows include the dividend payments and the payments of the nominal value, plus paid-in capital. Expected future
cash flows are discounted by using the yield curves derived from quoted interest rates and Credit Default Swap rates that match the maturity of the contracts.
The conditions for redemption and conversion of the cumulative preferred financing shares are disclosed in Note 22. The accrued interest is included in other
current financial liabilities (see Note 26) and not in the carrying amounts of non-derivative financial assets and liabilities.
Short-term deposits and similar instruments (€9 million) contain short-term liquid investments that are considered part of Ahold Delhaize’s cash management
financial assets.

in the amount of nil. Ahold Delhaize was required under these swap contracts to redeem the U.S. dollar notional amount through semi-annual installments that commenced in September 2004. The notes
were fully repaid on March 14, 2017 (see Note 21 for additional information).

over the previous five years (plans 2012 to 2017). For more information on the share-based compensation expenses see Note 32.

32 Share-based compensation

In 2017, Ahold Delhaize’s share-based compensation program consisted of a share grant program called Global Reward Opportunity (GRO). Total 2017 GRO
share-based compensation expenses were €79 million (2016: €61 million). Ahold Delhaize’s share-based compensation programs are equity-settled.
The fair value of the shares granted under the GRO program in 2017 at grant date was €64 million, of which €6 million related to Management Board members.
The fair value is expensed over the vesting period of the grants, adjusted for expected annual forfeitures of 5% (2016: 5%) excluding Management Board
members. For the share-based compensation expenses allocable to the individual Management Board members, see Note 31.
GRO program
Main characteristics
A revised GRO program was introduced in 2016. The performance shares granted under this program vest on the day after the annual General Meeting of
Shareholders in the third year after the grant, subject to certain performance conditions. The revised GRO program employs two financial measures: Return on
Capital (RoC) and Total Shareholder Return (TSR), as well as non-financial performance measures related to Sustainable Retailing targets. The total GRO award
is comprised of three portions of shares. The first 40% is linked to a three-year RoC target. Depending on performance, the number of shares that eventually
vest may range between zero and a maximum of 150% of the number of shares granted. Another 40% is linked to TSR (share price growth and dividends paid
over the performance period), with performance at vesting benchmarked against the TSR performance of a peer group comprised of 14 companies (refer to
the Remuneration section for the composition of the peer group). The number of shares that vest depends on the Company’s relative ranking in the peer group
and may range between zero and a maximum of 175% of the number of shares granted (refer to table below for the vesting percentages based on Ahold
Delhaize’s ranking within the peer group). For the remaining 20% of the total GRO share award, the performance at vesting is measured using Sustainable
Retailing targets. This measure relates to the Company’s Sustainable Retailing strategic ambitions. The targets set under this non-financial performance
measure are both qualitative and quantitative. Depending on performance, the number of shares that eventually vest can range between zero and a maximum
of 150% of the number of shares granted.
The table below indicates the percentage of shares that could vest based on Ahold Delhaize’s TSR ranking within the peer group:

Treatment of outstanding performance shares
Shares awarded before 2016 under the Ahold GRO program (to former Ahold Management Board members and associates) and the Delhaize European
long-term incentive plan (to former Delhaize Management Board members) have been rolled over in the (new) Ahold Delhaize's long-term equity-based
program (2016 GRO).
Outstanding (non-vested) performance share awards remaining from the Ahold GRO plan have been split into two parts. One part, which is related to the
full performance years prior to the year of the merger (2012, 2014 and 2015, where applicable), has been assessed against the performance of Ahold as
a standalone company, on the basis of the existing performance measures. Based on the performance realized in those years, this part of the award has
been assessed on the basis of the applicable share programs and converted into restricted Ahold Delhaize shares. These restricted shares are not subject
to additional performance criteria, but will be subject to the remaining vesting period and continued employment. The other part, which is related to the
performance during the year of the merger (2016) and beyond, will be assessed against the financial measures of Ahold Delhaize’s long-term equity-based
plan. The outstanding conditional shares will continue to be subject to the remaining vesting period and continued employment.
Outstanding (non-vested) performance shares awarded under the Delhaize European long-term incentive plan have similarly been converted into Ahold
Delhaize restricted shares and shares which are subject to meeting the performance measures of the Ahold Delhaize GRO plan.

Shares granted in 2014 and 2015 converted in 2016
Under the 2013-2015 GRO program, shares were granted over a three-year period. The program consisted of three components: one with a performance
hurdle at grant (conditional share grant) and two components with a performance hurdle at vesting (performance share grants). The size of the conditional
share grant was subject to the Executive Incentive Plan Multiplier of the preceding year. Half of the performance share grant was linked to a three-year RoC
target. Dependent on RoC performance, the number of shares that eventually vested could range between 0% and a maximum of 150% of the number of
shares granted. For the other half of the performance share grant, the performance at vesting was measured using the TSR ranking. The table below indicates
the percentage of shares with a TSR performance measure under the 2013-2015 GRO program that could vest based on Ahold’s ranking within the peer group:

with respect to the 2015 share grant. Based on these rankings the TSR performance shares were converted into restricted shares. The 2014 grant used a
percentage of 125% for Vice President and up and 120% for other participants, and the 2015 grant used a percentage of 150% for Vice President and up
and 135% for other participants. The remaining portion (one year for the 2014 grant and two years for the 2015 grant) has been assessed against the TSR
performance of the 2016 GRO plan.
Ahold’s RoC performance as of the end of 2015 was 93% of target with respect to the 2014 year share grant and 100% of target with respect to the 2015 share
grant. The RoC performance shares were converted into restricted shares using these vesting percentages. The remaining portion (one year for the 2014 grant
and two years for the 2015 grant) has been assessed against Ahold Delhaize’s RoC performance.
Shares granted in 2012 converted in 2016
Under the 2006-2012 GRO program, Ahold shares were granted through a mid-term (three-year) and a long-term (five-year) program. For participants other
than the Management Board members, the mid-term component of the program contained a matching share feature. For every five shares a participant held
for an additional two years after the vesting date, the participant receives one additional share.
Under the 2006-2012 GRO program, the shares granted through the long-term component were subject to a performance condition. The number of shares that
ultimately vest depends on Ahold’s performance compared to other retail companies, measured over a five-year period using TSR. The table below indicates
the percentage of shares that could vest based on Ahold’s ranking within the peer group:

As of the end of 2015, Ahold held the second position among the peer group for the performance years 2012-2015. Based on this TSR ranking, the
performance shares for the 2012 five-year share grant were converted into restricted shares using the measure of 130% for Management Board members and
135% for other participants. The remaining portion of the 2012 five-year grant, which is related to the Company’s performance in 2016, has been assessed
against the TSR performance measure of the 2016 GRO plan.
Remaining unvested shares granted under the 2006-2012 and the 2013-2015 GRO program will vest on the day after the publication of Ahold Delhaize’s
full-year results in the third year (three-year programs) or fifth year (five-year programs) after the grant, subject to performance conditions and provided the
participant is still employed by Ahold Delhaize. Remaining unvested shares granted to Management Board members will vest on the day after the annual
General Meeting of Shareholders in the third year (mid-term component) or fifth year (long-term component) after the grant, subject to performance conditions
and continued employment.

Other awards
A limited number of shares were granted to other ExCo members and other employees in 2014 and 2015 under a special purpose plan. This program consists
of unconditional and conditional shares. The unconditional shares vest immediately on the award date. The conditional shares vest in two tranches. Half of the
conditional shares vest on the day after the publication of Ahold Delhaize’s full-year results in the first year and half in the second year after the grant.
Also, a number of shares were granted to a select group of senior management (excluding the Management Board and ExCo members) in 2016 under
a one-time retention incentive award. The vesting of these individual share awards is contingent upon the realization of the merger implementation.
These performance shares will vest in two installments of 50% each of the granted shares. The first installment vested 12 months after the date of grant, on
November 23, 2017. The second installment will vest 24 months after the date of grant. To underline the retention function of this award, an additional holding
period of 12 months applies from the date of vesting.
Shares vesting in 2018
In 2018, the 2015 GRO grant will vest. The GRO shares vesting will comprise both conditional shares as well as performance shares based on the Company’s
TSR and RoC performance. Part of the TSR and RoC performance share grants were already converted into restricted shares in 2016 (see Shares granted in
2015 converted in 2016 above) and are not subject to additional performance criteria. For the remaining portion of the performance shares, 2017 TSR and RoC
performance was assessed. As of the end of 2017, Ahold Delhaize ranked fourth in the TSR peer group with respect to the 2015 grant. Based on these TSR
rankings and applying the 2016 GRO vesting table, the vesting percentage for the 2015 grant was 110%.
At the end of each reporting period, Ahold Delhaize revises its estimates of the number of shares that are expected to vest based on the non-market vesting
conditions (RoC and Sustainable Retailing performance). Ahold Delhaize recognizes the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income
statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity. The final vesting percentage for the portion of the 2015 shares dependent on Ahold Delhaize’s RoC
performance is 105%.
On April 12, 2018, a maximum of 0.2 million shares granted in 2015 to members of the Management Board under the Ahold GRO plan are expected to vest.
On May 29, 2018, a maximum of 0.1 million shares granted in 2015 to members of the Management Board under the Delhaize European long-term incentive
plan are expected to vest. Except to finance taxes and social security charges due on the vesting date, members of the Management Board cannot sell shares
for a period of at least five years following the grant date, or until the date of resignation from the Management Board, if this period is shorter.
On March 1, 2018, a maximum of 2.7 million shares granted in 2015 to Ahold Delhaize associates under the Ahold GRO plan are expected to vest. Vesting is
subject to the participant being employed by the Company on the applicable vesting date. As of the vesting date, participants are allowed to sell all or part of
the shares vested, subject to insider trading restrictions as applicable from time to time.
In addition, a maximum number of 0.7 million shares granted in 2016 to Ahold Delhaize associates under the one-time retention plan are expected to vest in
November 2018, provided the performance conditions are met.
The Company will use treasury shares for the delivery of the vested shares.

3 The vesting date of the five-year 2012 grant and the three-year 2014 grant was April 13, 2017, for the former Ahold board members. The share price was €19.28 on April 13, 2017. The vesting date of the
three-year 2014 grant was May 26, 2017, for the former Delhaize board members. The share price was €19.69 on May 26, 2017.
4 For the conditional and restricted shares, the minimum number of shares that could potentially vest equals the number of outstanding shares. For the TSR performance grants, the minimum number of
shares that could potentially vest would be nil if Ahold Delhaize’s ranking was eight or lower (as explained in the section Main characteristics above). For the RoC and sustainability performance grants,
the minimum number of shares that could potentially vest equals nil (as explained in the section Main characteristics above).
5 For the conditional and restricted shares, the maximum number of shares that could potentially vest equals the number of outstanding shares. For the TSR performance grants, the maximum number
of shares that could potentially vest equals 175% of outstanding shares if Ahold Delhaize’s ranking is one. For the RoC performance grants and for the Sustainable Retailing performance grants the
maximum number of shares that could potentially vest equals 150% of outstanding shares, (as explained in the section Main characteristics above).

2 The grant date fair value of the matching shares is expensed over the five-year vesting period. This table presents the matching shares as awarded in the year of vesting. No matching shares are
outstanding at the end of 2017.
3 Represents the adjustment to the number of shares granted resulting from the TSR ranking and RoC performance.
4 The vesting date of the five-year 2012 grant, the matching shares related to the 2012 grant and the 2014 grant was March 2, 2017. The share price was €20.44 on March 2, 2017. The vesting date
of the first installment of the 2016 retention award was November 23, 2017. The share price was €16.99 on November 23, 2017.
5 The 2015 grant includes the special purpose plan as described above. Under this program, 61,200 shares were granted in 2015, of which 20,400 vested in 2015, 24,400 vested in 2016 and 16,400
vested in 2017.

Valuation model and input variables
The weighted average fair value of the shares granted in 2017, for all eligible participants including Management Board members, amounted to €9.55, €17.04
and €17.04 per share for TSR performance shares, RoC performance shares and Sustainable Retailing performance shares, respectively (2016: €20.44,
€20.13 and €20.13). The fair values of the RoC and Sustainable Retailing performance shares are based on the Black-Scholes model. The fair values of the TSR
performance shares are determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model, which considers the likelihood of Ahold Delhaize’s TSR ending at various ranks as
well as the expected share price at each rank. The most important assumptions used in the valuations of the fair values were as follows:
2017

Closing share price at grant date2
Risk-free interest rate
Volatility
Assumed dividend yield
1 The incremental fair values of the shares converted in 2016 in Ahold Delhaize’s long-term equity-based program are based on the same assumptions.
2 Closing share price is adjusted for dividends.

Expected volatility has been determined based on historical volatilities for a period of three years.

1 Restated from last year’s disclosure of €7,489 million due to alignment of accounting policies.

The decrease in the lease commitments in 2017 compared to 2016 is mainly due to exchange rate differences.
Certain store leases provide for contingent additional rentals based on a percentage of sales and consumer price indices. Substantially all of the store leases
have renewal options for additional terms. None of Ahold Delhaize’s leases impose restrictions on Ahold Delhaize’s ability to pay dividends, incur additional
debt or enter into additional leasing arrangements. The annual costs of Ahold Delhaize’s operating leases from continuing operations, net of sublease income,
are as follows:

In addition to the operating lease commitments disclosed above, Ahold Delhaize has signed lease agreements for properties under development of which
it has not yet taken possession. The total future minimum lease payments for these agreements amount to approximately €129 million (2016: €173 million).
These lease contracts are subject to conditions precedent to the rent commencement date.
Ahold Delhaize as lessor
Ahold Delhaize rents out its investment properties (mainly retail units in shopping centers containing an Ahold Delhaize store) and also (partially) subleases
various other properties that are leased by Ahold Delhaize under operating leases. The aggregate amounts of the related future minimum lease and sublease

Capital investment commitments
As of December 31, 2017, Ahold Delhaize had outstanding capital investment commitments for property, plant and equipment and investment property,
and for intangible assets of approximately €214 million and €10 million, respectively (January 1, 2017: €264 million and €30 million, respectively).
Ahold Delhaize’s share in the capital investment commitments of its unconsolidated joint ventures JMR and Super Indo amounted to €3 million as of
December 31, 2017 (January 1, 2017: €7 million).
Purchase commitments
Ahold Delhaize enters into purchase commitments with vendors in the ordinary course of business. The Company has purchase contracts with some vendors
for varying terms that require Ahold Delhaize to buy services and predetermined volumes of goods and goods not-for-resale at fixed prices. As of December
31, 2017, the Company’s purchase commitments were approximately €1,086 million (January 1, 2017: €1,086 million). Not included in the purchase commitments
are those purchase contracts for which Ahold Delhaize has received advance vendor allowances, such as upfront signing payments in consideration of its
purchase commitments. These contracts generally may be terminated without satisfying the purchase commitments upon the repayment of the unearned
portions of the advance vendor allowances. The unearned portion of these advance vendor allowances is recorded as a liability on the balance sheet.
Contingent liabilities

The amounts included in the table above are the maximum undiscounted amounts the Group could be forced to settle under the arrangement for the full
guaranteed amount, if that amount is claimed by the counterparty to the guarantee. As part of the divestment of U.S. Foodservice in 2007, Ahold Delhaize
received an irrevocable standby letter of credit for $216 million (€163 million), which was reduced to $54 million (€45 million) as of December 31, 2017 (2016:
$64 million (€60 million)).
Ahold Delhaize is contingently liable for leases that have been assigned and / or transferred to third parties in connection with facility closings and disposals.
Ahold Delhaize could be required to assume the financial obligations under these leases, if any of the third parties are unable to fulfill their lease obligations.
The lease guarantees are based on the nominal value of future minimum lease payments of the relevant leases, which extend through 2040. The amounts
of the lease guarantees exclude the cost of common area maintenance and real estate taxes; such amounts may vary in time, per region, and per property.
Of the €705 million in the undiscounted lease guarantees, €145 million relates to the BI-LO / Bruno’s divestment, €156 million to the Sweetbay, Harveys, and
Reid's divestment, €113 million to the Bottom Dollar Food divestment and €112 million to the Tops divestment. On a discounted basis, the lease guarantees
amount to €617 million and €786 million as of December 31, 2017, and January 1, 2017, respectively.

BI-LO / Bruno’s divestment
In 2005, Ahold Delhaize divested its U.S. retail subsidiaries BI-LO and Bruno’s. On February 5, 2009, and March 23, 2009, Bruno's Supermarkets, LLC and
BI-LO, LLC, respectively, filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (the filings). As a result of the filings, Ahold Delhaize has made an
assessment of its potential obligations under the lease guarantees based upon the remaining initial term of each lease, an assessment of the possibility that
Ahold Delhaize would have to pay under a guarantee and any potential remedies that Ahold Delhaize may have to limit future lease payments. Consequently,
in 2009, Ahold Delhaize recognized provisions of €109 million and related tax benefit offsets of €47 million within results on divestments.
On May 12, 2010, the reorganized BI-LO exited bankruptcy protection and BI-LO assumed 149 operating locations that are guaranteed by Ahold Delhaize.
During the BI-LO bankruptcy, BI-LO rejected a total of 16 leases that are guaranteed by Ahold Delhaize and Ahold Delhaize also took assignment of 12 other
BI-LO leases with Ahold Delhaize guarantees. Based on the foregoing developments, Ahold Delhaize recognized a reduction of €23 million in its provision,
after tax, within results on divestments in the first half of 2010. Since the end of the second quarter of 2010, Ahold Delhaize has entered into settlements with
a number of landlords relating to leases of former BI-LO or Bruno’s stores that are guaranteed by Ahold Delhaize.
At the end of 2017, the remaining provision relating to BI-LO and Bruno’s was €11 million (2016: €15 million) with a related tax benefit offset of €3 million
(2016: €6 million). This amount represents Ahold Delhaize’s best estimate of the discounted aggregate amount of the remaining lease obligations and
associated charges, net of known mitigation offsets, which could result in cash outflows for Ahold Delhaize under the various lease guarantees. Ahold Delhaize
continues to monitor any developments and pursue its mitigation efforts with respect to these lease guarantee liabilities.
Sweetbay, Harveys and Reid's and Bottom Dollar Food divestments
As part of Ahold Delhaize’s divestment of Sweetbay, Harveys and Reid’s in 2014 and Bottom Dollar Food in 2015, Ahold Delhaize had provided guarantees for
a number of existing operating and finance lease contracts, which extend through 2037. Ahold Delhaize has made an assessment of its potential obligations
under lease guarantees considering the remaining term of each lease, re-let potential of the property if the acquirer were to default on the lease, and the credit
position of the counterparty. Ahold Delhaize recognized a liability of €20 million, which represents the estimated fair value of the lease guarantees.
Other
Ahold Delhaize has provided corporate guarantees to certain suppliers of its franchisees or non-consolidated entities. Ahold Delhaize would be required
to perform under the guarantee, if the franchisee or non-consolidated entity failed to meet its financial obligations, as described in the guarantee.
Buyback guarantees relate to Ahold Delhaize’s commitment to repurchase stores or inventory from certain franchisees at predetermined prices. The buyback
guarantees reflect the maximum committed repurchase value under the guarantees. The last of the corporate and buyback guarantees expire in 2022.
Representations and warranties as part of the divestment of Ahold Delhaize’s operations
Ahold Delhaize has provided, in the relevant sales agreements, customary representations and warranties including, but not limited to, completeness of
books and records, title to assets, schedule of material contracts and arrangements, litigation, permits, labor matters, and employee benefits and taxes.
These representations and warranties will generally terminate, depending on their specific features, a number of years after the date of the relevant transaction
completion date.
The most significant divestments of operations are described below. In addition, specific, limited representations and warranties exist for a number of Ahold
Delhaize’s smaller divestments. The aggregate impact of claims, if any, under such representations and warranties is not expected to be material.
Disco divestment
As part of the divestment of Disco S.A. (Disco) in 2004, Ahold Delhaize is required to indemnify the buyers of Disco S.A. (Disco) and Disco for certain claims
made by alleged creditors of certain Uruguayan and other banks, with a contingent liability cap of €11 million. Ahold Delhaize assesses its likelihood to be liable
up to the amount of the contingent liability cap to be remote. The cap does not include Ahold Delhaize’s indemnification obligation relating to the Uruguayan
litigation described in the Legal proceedings section of this Note. Ahold Delhaize’s indemnification obligation relating to this litigation is not capped at a certain
amount nor restricted to a certain time period.

Bradlees divestment
In 1992, Stop & Shop spun off Bradlees Stores, Inc. (Bradlees) as a public company (the Bradlees Spin-off). In connection with the Bradlees Spin-off, Stop
& Shop assigned to Bradlees certain commercial real property leases. Pursuant to a 1995 reorganization of Bradlees and a subsequent wind-down and
liquidation of Bradlees following a bankruptcy protection filing in 2000 (collectively, the Bradlees Bankruptcies), a number of such real property leases were
assumed and assigned to third parties. Pursuant to applicable law, Stop & Shop may be contingently liable to landlords under certain of the leases assigned
in connection with the Bradlees Spin-off and subsequently assumed and assigned to third parties in connection with the Bradlees Bankruptcies.
BI-LO / Bruno’s divestment
In connection with the divestment of BI-LO and Bruno’s in 2005, Ahold Delhaize may be contingently liable to landlords under guarantees of some 200 BI-LO
or Bruno’s operating or finance leases that existed at the time of the divestment, in the event of a future default by the tenant under such leases. As a result
of the bankruptcy filings by BI-LO and Bruno’s during 2009, a provision was recognized in 2009. BI-LO exited bankruptcy in May 2010 and the Company
has re-evaluated its estimate of liability. For more information, refer to the Guarantees section of this Note.
Tops Markets, LLC divestment
In connection with the divestment of Tops in 2007, Ahold Delhaize has certain post-closing indemnification obligations under the sale agreement that the
Company believes are customary for transactions of this nature. Ahold Delhaize retained liabilities as part of the divestment, including contingent liability
for 45 leases that carry Ahold Delhaize guarantees. Additionally, Ahold Delhaize retained liabilities related to stores previously divested, including guarantees
on five Tops stores in eastern New York state, as well as liabilities related to the Tops convenience stores and the stores in northeast Ohio as outlined under
Tops convenience stores.
Tops convenience stores: Wilson Farms and Sugarcreek
Pursuant to applicable law, Tops may be contingently liable to landlords under 186 leases assigned in connection with the divestment of the Tops’ Wilson
Farms and Sugarcreek convenience stores in 2005, in the event of a future default by the tenant under such leases. Ahold Delhaize may be contingently
liable to landlords under the guarantees of 77 of these leases in the same event.
Tops northeast Ohio stores
Tops closed all of its locations in northeast Ohio prior to year-end 2006. As of December 31, 2017, 33 of the total 55 closed locations in northeast Ohio have
been divested or are now subleased or partially subleased. An additional 19 leases have been terminated. Three stores continue to be marketed. In connection
with the store divestments, Tops and Ahold Delhaize have certain post-closing indemnification obligations under the sale agreements, which Ahold Delhaize
believes are customary for transactions of this nature. Pursuant to applicable law, Ahold Delhaize may be contingently liable to landlords under guarantees of
14 of such leases in the event of a future default by the tenant under such leases. If Ahold Delhaize is able to assign the leases for the remaining northeast Ohio
stores, then pursuant to applicable law, Ahold Delhaize also may be contingently liable to landlords under guarantees of certain of such remaining leases in the
event of a future default by the tenant under such leases.
Sweetbay, Harveys and Reid’s and Bottom Dollar Food divestments
As part of Ahold Delhaize’s divestment of Sweetbay, Harveys and Reid’s in 2014 and Bottom Dollar Food in 2015, Ahold Delhaize has provided guarantees for
a number of existing operating and finance lease contracts, which extend through 2037. As of December 31, 2017, Ahold Delhaize may be contingently liable
for 98 leases as part of the Sweetbay, Harveys and Reid’s divestment and 37 leases as part of the Bottom Dollar Food divestment. In the event of a future
default of the buyer, Ahold Delhaize’s obligations under the terms of the contracts to the landlords will be triggered. The leases guaranteed are in respect of two
specific buyers. The Sweetbay, Harveys and Reid's stores were sold to BI-LO and the Bottom Dollar Food stores were sold to Aldi. For more information, refer to
the Guarantees section of this Note.

Tom & Co divestment
In 2016, Ahold Delhaize divested the pet specialist shop chain Tom & Co. As part of the transaction, Ahold Delhaize granted indemnities to the purchaser
of all divested stores, which Ahold Delhaize believes are customary for transactions of this nature.
Divestment of remedy stores in Belgium
In March 2016, Ahold Delhaize received approval from the Belgian Competition Authority (BCA) for the merger between Ahold and Delhaize. The approval was
conditional upon the divestment of a limited number of stores and projects in Belgium to address competition concerns raised by BCA. In 2017, Ahold Delhaize
completed these divestments, which Ahold Delhaize believes took place subject to terms and conditions customary for transactions of this nature.
Divestment of remedy stores in the U.S.
In July 2016, as a condition of receiving regulatory clearance for their merger from the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC), Ahold and Delhaize
entered into a consent agreement (“Consent Agreement”) with the FTC that required Ahold and Delhaize to divest stores in seven states in order to prevent the
merger from being anti-competitive. In connection with the Consent Agreement, Ahold and Delhaize subsidiaries entered into agreements with seven buyers
to sell a total of 86 stores (81 of these stores are required divestitures under the Consent Agreement), including 73 leased stores and 13 owned stores. As of
July 19, 2017, Ahold Delhaize had completed all of the required divestitures. With respect to the 73 leased stores, the store sales involved the applicable Ahold
Delhaize subsidiary assigning each store lease to the buyer. Pursuant to applicable law, the Ahold Delhaize subsidiary which assigned each of the 73 leases
may be contingently liable to the landlord under such lease, in the event of a future default by the tenant under such lease. Any other Ahold Delhaize subsidiary
that previously held the tenant’s interest in such lease may also be liable in such event. In addition, Ahold Delhaize or Ahold Delhaize subsidiaries also may be
contingently liable to landlords under the guarantees of 13 of the 73 leases in the same event. See also Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.
Income tax
Because Ahold Delhaize operates in a number of countries, its income is subject to taxation in differing jurisdictions and at differing tax rates.
Significant judgment is required in determining the consolidated income tax position. We seek to organize our affairs in a sustainable manner, taking into
account the applicable regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate. As a result of Ahold Delhaize’s multi-jurisdictional operations, it is exposed to
a number of different tax risks including, but not limited to, changes in tax laws or interpretations of such tax laws. The authorities in the jurisdictions where
Ahold Delhaize operates may review the Company’s tax returns and may disagree with the positions taken in those returns. While the ultimate outcome of
such reviews is not certain, Ahold Delhaize has considered the merits of its filing positions in its overall evaluation of potential tax liabilities and believes it
has adequate liabilities recorded in its consolidated financial statements for exposures on these matters. Based on its evaluation of the potential tax liabilities
and the merits of Ahold Delhaize’s filing positions, it is unlikely that potential tax exposures over and above the amounts currently recorded as liabilities in its
consolidated financial statements will be material to its financial condition or future results of operations.
Legal proceedings
Ahold Delhaize and certain of its former or current subsidiaries are involved in a number of legal proceedings, which include litigation as a result of divestments,
tax, employment, and other litigation and inquiries. The legal proceedings discussed below, whether pending, threatened or unasserted, if decided adversely
or settled, may result in liability material to Ahold Delhaize’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Ahold Delhaize may enter into discussions
regarding the settlement of these and other proceedings, and may enter into settlement agreements, if it believes settlement is in the best interest of Ahold
Delhaize’s shareholders. In accordance with IAS 37 “Provisions, Contingent Liabilities, and Contingent Assets,” Ahold Delhaize has recognized provisions with
respect to these proceedings, where appropriate, which are reflected on its balance sheet.

Albert Heijn Franchising
In 2014, the Vereniging Albert Heijn Franchisenemers (an association of Albert Heijn franchisees or VAHFR) has asserted claims against Albert Heijn
Franchising BV (an Ahold Delhaize subsidiary or AHF), for the years 2008 through 2012, the alleged value of which exceeds €200 million in aggregate.
AHF and the VAHFR have had ongoing discussions for a number of years about the resolution of certain cost items under individual franchise agreements.
On December 24, 2014, AHF and other legal entities within the Ahold Delhaize group of companies received a writ in which VAHFR and 242 individual
claimants would initiate proceedings as of April 15, 2015, before the District Court of Haarlem with respect to these discussions. On November 16, 2016,
the court issued a judgment rejecting all claims of the VAHFR and the claimants. On February 13, 2017, VAHFR and 240 individual claimants filed a formal
appeal against the judgment.
In September 2017, the claimants filed their grounds for appeal in which they assert unquantified claims for the years 2008 until 2016. AHF believes that
the District Court was correct in rejecting all claims and that the position of the VAHFR and individual claimants as expressed in the appeal is without merit.
AHF and its affiliates will vigorously defend their interest in the legal proceedings.
Uruguayan litigation
Ahold Delhaize, together with Disco and Disco Ahold International Holdings N.V. (DAIH), is a party to one lawsuit in Uruguay related to Ahold Delhaize’s 2002
acquisition of Velox Retail Holdings’ shares in the capital of DAIH. The two other related lawsuits were decided in favor of Ahold Delhaize without any further
right to appeal of the plaintiffs in 2013. The damages alleged by the plaintiffs, alleged creditors of certain Uruguayan and other banks, amount to approximately
$62 million (€52 million) plus interest and costs. As part of the divestment of Disco to Cencosud in 2004, Ahold Delhaize indemnified Cencosud and Disco
against the outcome of these legal proceedings. The one remaining lawsuit is ongoing. Ahold Delhaize continues to believe that the plaintiffs’ claims are without
merit and will continue to vigorously oppose such claims.
Greek litigation
In a shareholders’ matter related to Alfa Beta Vassilopoulos S.A. (“AB”), Ahold Delhaize’s wholly-owned subsidiary in Greece, Ahold Delhaize was notified in
2011 that some former shareholders of AB, who together held 7% of AB shares, filed a claim with the Court of First Instance of Athens challenging the price paid
by Ahold Delhaize during the squeeze-out process that was approved by the Hellenic Capital Markets Commission. They have also filed a separate claim for
compound interest. Ahold Delhaize believes that the squeeze-out transaction has been executed and completed in compliance with all legal and regulatory
requirements and against a fair price, and vigorously defends itself against these claims. A decision on the merits of the matter by the Court of First Instance is
expected to occur in 2018.
Other legal proceedings
In addition to the legal proceedings described previously in this Note, Ahold Delhaize and its former or current subsidiaries are parties to a number of other
legal proceedings arising out of their business operations. Ahold Delhaize believes that the ultimate resolution of these other proceedings will not, in the
aggregate, have a material adverse effect on Ahold Delhaize’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Such other legal proceedings, however,
are subject to inherent uncertainties and the outcome of individual matters is unpredictable. It is possible that Ahold Delhaize could be required to make
expenditures, in excess of established provisions, in amounts that cannot reasonably be estimated.

1 Significant accounting policies

Basis of preparation
Ahold Delhaize’s parent company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Part 9, Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. In accordance with
subsection 8 of section 362, Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code, the recognition and measurement principles applied in these parent company financial statements
are the same as those applied in the consolidated financial statements (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements).
Investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates
Investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are measured at net asset value (equity method of accounting). Net asset value is based on the
measurement of assets (including goodwill), provisions and liabilities, and determination of profit as described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements
for investments in joint arrangements and associates. Goodwill is subsumed in the carrying amount of the net asset value if an investment in a subsidiary is
acquired through the Company’s intermediate subsidiary.

2 Expenses by nature

The operating expenses are specified by nature as follows:

The labor costs consists of employee expenses of €18 million (2016: €19 million), other related employee costs of €1 million (2016: €1 million) and other
contracted personnel expenses of €6 million (2016: €6 million).
The decrease in Other operational expenses is mainly attributable to higher merger-related expenses in 2016.

3 Employees

The average number of employees of Koninklijke Ahold Delhaize N.V. in full-time equivalents during 2017 was seven (2016: six), of whom none were employed
outside the Netherlands. Two management board members serve as board members outside the Netherlands via a service agreement, but are not employed
by Koninklijke Ahold Delhaize N.V.
The current number of employees of Koninklijke Ahold Delhaize N.V. consist primarily of members of the Executive Committee, including the Management
Board. Salaries, social security charges and pension expenses amounted to €17 million, €0.8 million and €0.3 million, respectively, for 2017 (2016: expenses
of €18 million, €0.8 million and €0.1 million, respectively).
For information on the parent company’s defined benefit pension plan, the remuneration of the Management Board and the Supervisory Board and the parent
company’s share-based compensation plans, see Notes 23, 31 and 32, respectively, to the consolidated financial statements.
The net pension liability and the net pension expense are calculated on the basis of the parent company’s active employees only.

10 Shareholders’ equity

The shareholders’ equity in the parent company financial statements equals the equity attributable to common shareholders presented in the consolidated
financial statements, except that legal reserve participations and accumulated earnings (deficit) are presented separately.
The currency translation reserve, cash flow hedging reserve and reserve participations are legal reserves that are required by Dutch law. The reserve
participations include the increases in net asset value of joint ventures and associates since their first inclusion, less any amounts that can be distributed
without legal restrictions.
If the currency translation reserve or the cash flow hedging reserve has a negative balance, distributions to the Company’s shareholders are restricted
to the extent of the negative balance. Of the total equity as of December 31, 2017, €15,170 million, an amount of €346 million is non-distributable
(January 1, 2017: €1,130 million out of total equity of €16,276 million). For more information on the dividends on common shares, see Note 20 to the
consolidated financial statements.

14 Derivatives

The parent company regularly enters into derivative contracts with banks to hedge foreign currency and interest exposures of the parent company or its
subsidiaries. Derivative contracts that are entered into to hedge exposures of subsidiaries are generally mirrored with intercompany derivative contracts with
the subsidiaries that are exposed to the hedged risks on substantially identical terms as the external derivative contracts. In these parent company financial
statements, the external derivative contracts and the intercompany derivative contracts are presented separately on the balance sheet. In situations where
the external derivative contract qualifies for hedge accounting treatment in the consolidated financial statements, the external derivative contract and the
intercompany derivative contract are presented as “Hedging derivatives external” and “Hedging derivatives intercompany,” respectively. In situations where
the external derivative contract does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment in the consolidated financial statements, the external derivative contract and
the intercompany derivative contract are presented as “Other derivatives external” and “Other derivatives intercompany,” respectively.
Fair value movements of external derivative contracts that were entered into to hedge the exposures of subsidiaries are recorded directly in income, where
they effectively offset the fair value movements of the mirroring intercompany derivatives that are also recorded directly in income. Details of these derivative
contracts, other financial instruments and the parent company’s risk management strategies are included in Note 30 to the consolidated financial statements
and in the tables presented below.

In 2016, fair value changes include exchange rate differences and installments paid on a cross-currency swap that was entered into on behalf of one of the
parent company’s subsidiaries. The cross-currency swap, accounted for as a cash flow hedge, was used to hedge currency and cash flow risk on floating
debt denominated in foreign currency, related to the JPY 33,000 notes. The yen-euro currency swap was unwound on November 15, 2016.

Articles of Association provisions governing the distribution of profit
The holders of common shares are entitled to one vote per share and to participate in the distribution of dividends and liquidation proceeds. Pursuant to
section 39 of the Articles of Association, a dividend will first be declared out of net income on cumulative preferred shares and cumulative preferred financing
shares. Any net income remaining after reservations deemed necessary by the Supervisory Board, in consultation with the Management Board, will then be
available for distribution to the common shareholders subject to approval at the General Meeting of Shareholders. The Management Board, with the approval
of the Supervisory Board, may propose that the General Meeting of Shareholders make distributions wholly or partly in the form of common shares. Amounts
of net income not paid in the form of dividends will be added to the accumulated deficit. In the financial statements, the dividend on cumulative preferred
financing shares is included in the income statement. Consequently, net income according to the parent company income statement is fully attributable to
common shareholders.

Our audit approach
Overview and context
Koninklijke Ahold Delhaize N.V. is an international food retail group operating supermarkets and e-commerce through components active in Belgium, the
Czech Republic, Greece, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Romania, Serbia and the United States and through participating in joint ventures in Indonesia
and Portugal. Our group audit scope and approach is set out in ”The scope of our group audit” section. We paid specific attention to the areas of focus
driven by the operations of the Group as set out below.
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, we
considered where the Management Board made important judgments; for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making
assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain.
In Note 2 of the financial statements the company describes the areas of judgment in applying accounting policies and the key sources of estimation
uncertainty. Given the higher inherent risks of material misstatement in the impairment testing of goodwill and recognition of vendor allowance income,
we considered these to be key audit matters as set out in the section “Key audit matters” of this report. Furthermore, we identified the employee benefit
plan measurement and disclosures as a key audit matter because of the complexity and judgment required.
Another area of focus, that was not considered to be a key audit matter was the risk fraud in revenue recognition. As in all of our audits, we also addressed the
risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by management that may represent a risk of material
misstatement due to fraud.
We ensured that the audit teams both at group and at component levels included the appropriate skills and competencies which are needed for the audit
of a retail company. The Group’s operations utilize a range of legacy IT systems. The adequacy and effective operation of controls over these systems is an
important element of the integrity of financial reporting within the Group. We utilized IT specialists in our audit to evaluate the adequacy and effective operation
of these controls. Furthermore, we included specialists in areas requiring valuation, tax and actuarial (including pension accounting) expertise.

The outlines of our audit approach were as follows:
Materiality

continued

Overall materiality: €96 million which represents 5% of income before income taxes.
Audit scope

We conducted audit work at 10 components.
Each component is audited by local engagement teams that are based in the U.S., the Netherlands, Belgium, Greece,
Switzerland and Curacao.
Site visits were conducted in five countries: U.S., the Netherlands, Belgium, Greece and Switzerland.
Our audit coverage is 88% of consolidated net sales, 88% of total assets and 92% of income before income taxes.
Key audit matters

Impairment testing of goodwill
Recognition of vendor allowances
Employee benefit plan measurement and disclosures
Materiality
The scope of our audit is influenced by the application of materiality which is further explained in the section “Our responsibilities for the audit of the
financial statements”.
Based on our professional judgment, we set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality, including the overall materiality for the financial statements as a whole
as set out in the table below. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the
individual financial statement line items and disclosures and to evaluate the effect of identified misstatements both individually and in aggregate, on the financial
statements as a whole and on our opinion.
Overall group materiality
How we determined it
Rationale for benchmark applied

Component materiality

€96 million (2016: €66 million). Our 2017 materiality increased primarily because of the inclusion of the results from the former
Delhaize entities for a full year in 2017 as opposed to five months in 2016.
We used our professional judgment to determine the overall materiality. As a basis for our judgment we used 5% of income
before income taxes.
We used income before income taxes as the primary benchmark, a generally accepted auditing practice, based on our analysis
of the common information needs of users of the financial statements. On this basis we believe that income before income taxes
is an important metric for the financial performance of the Company.
To each component in our audit scope, we, based on our judgment, allocate materiality that is less than our overall group
materiality. The range of materiality allocated across components was between €7.5 and €85 million.

We also take misstatements and / or possible misstatements into account that, in our judgment, are material for qualitative reasons.
We agreed with the Supervisory Board that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above €4.8 million (2016: €3.3 million) as well as
misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.

The scope of our group audit
Koninklijke Ahold Delhaize N.V. is the parent company of a group of entities. The financial information of this group is included in the consolidated financial
statements of Koninklijke Ahold Delhaize N.V.
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed sufficient work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into
account the management structure of the Group, the nature of operations of its components, the accounting processes and controls, and the markets in which
the components of the Group operate. In establishing the overall group audit strategy and plan, we determined the type of work required to be performed at the
component level by the group engagement team and by each component auditor.
Six components were subject to audits of their complete financial information, four of which were individually significant to the Group. These components
include the retail operations at Ahold USA, Delhaize America, and the Netherlands as well as the Global Support Office activities in the Netherlands (which
includes financing activities in Switzerland). The other two components, the Belgian and Greek retail operations, were selected to achieve appropriate audit
coverage over the consolidated financial statements. Additionally, four components were selected for audit procedures to achieve appropriate coverage on
specific financial line items in the consolidated financial statements. These components included the Global Support Office activities in the United States and
the insurance captives located in the U.S., Ireland and Curacao.
In total, in performing these procedures, we achieved the following coverage on the financial line items:
Net sales
Total assets
Income before income taxes

88%
88%
92%

None of the remaining components represented more than 3% of total Group net sales or 3% of total Group assets. For those remaining components we
attended internal quarterly closing meetings with local and Group management and performed, among other things, analytical procedures to corroborate our
assessment that there were no significant risks of material misstatements within those components.
The Global Support Office activities in the Netherlands, which includes financing activities in Switzerland, Group consolidation, financial statement disclosures
and a number of complex items were audited by the group engagement team at the Company’s head office. This included procedures performed over financial
instruments such as loans and derivatives, goodwill impairment testing, Management Board remuneration including share-based payments and compliance
of accounting positions taken by the Group in accordance with EU-IFRS. For all other components we used component auditors who are familiar with the local
laws and regulations to perform the audit work.
Where the work was performed by component auditors, we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in the audit work at those components to
be able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the consolidated financial statements as a
whole. The group engagement team directed the planning, reviewed the results of the work undertaken by component auditors and assessed and discussed
the findings with the component auditors during conference calls and site visits. In the current year, the group engagement team visited local management and
the component auditors at the in scope locations in the U.S., the Netherlands, Belgium, Greece and Switzerland.
By performing the procedures above at components, combined with additional procedures at Group level, we have been able to obtain sufficient and
appropriate audit evidence on the Group’s financial information, as a whole, to provide a basis for our opinion on the consolidated financial statements.

Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements. We have
communicated the key audit matters to the Supervisory Board. The key audit matters are not a comprehensive reflection of all matters that were identified
by our audit and that we discussed. In this section, we described the key audit matters and included a summary of the audit procedures we performed on
those matters.
The key audit matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon. We do not
provide separate opinions on these matters or on specific elements of the financial statements. Any comments or observations we make on the results
of our procedures should be read in this context.
The context of our audit is set by the Group’s 2017 results and operations. As the Delhaize merger took place in 2016, the key audit matter related to the
accounting for the merger transaction and alignment of accounting policies has been removed. Instead, the impairment testing of goodwill primarily related to
the Delhaize merger has been added as key audit matter. In addition we have removed the key audit matter related to store asset impairment due to absence
of significant triggering events in 2017 that would require further impairment analysis at store level compared to 2016. The other key audit matters, recognition
of vendor allowances and employee benefit plan measurement and disclosures, are consistent with prior year in view of their magnitude and the significant
estimates and assumptions involved.
Key audit matter
Impairment testing of goodwill
As described in Note 13 the Group had €6.9 billion of goodwill
as at December 31, 2017. The majority of this balance (€6 billion)
relates to the former Delhaize business acquired in 2016. This was
allocated at acquisition date to individual cash generating units
(CGUs).
As disclosed in Note 2 and Note 3 to the financial statements, the
Group tests its CGUs containing goodwill for impairment annually
and if there is a triggering event at an earlier or later reporting
date. This is done by comparing the recoverable amounts of the
individual CGUs, being the higher of value-in-use and fair value
less costs of disposal, to the carrying amounts.
Our key audit matter focused on the goodwill allocated to
Hannaford, Food Lion and Delhaize Belgium CGUs which
amount to €3 billion of the total goodwill recognized in the
Delhaize acquisition. This was primarily driven by the inherent
limited headroom as the purchase price allocation was recently
performed combined with certain market developments in the
U.S. and Belgium. We also considered this to be a key audit matter
due to the magnitude of the goodwill balance in these CGUs and
the significant judgment involved in estimating the recoverable
amounts. The recoverable amounts of these CGUs was based
on fair value less cost of disposal. Such amounts are based on
cash flow forecasts that include management’s estimate of market
participant’s views of key value driver inputs and external market
conditions such as inflation, volume growth and competition,
capital expenditures and discount rates applied.

How our audit addressed the matter
We evaluated management’s process and design effectiveness of controls over the
impairment assessment including the appropriateness of management’s identification
of the Group’s CGUs, indicators of impairment, discount rates and forecasts.
With the support of our valuation experts we challenged management’s assumptions
used in determining the future cash flow forecasts for the Hannaford, Food Lion and
Delhaize Belgium CGUs. We benchmarked key market related assumptions (as
disclosed in Note 13) against external data and historical performance and assessed
the reasonableness of the assumptions by comparing the sum of the future cash flow
forecasts of all CGUs to the market capitalization. We also verified the mathematical
accuracy of management’s valuation models and agreed relevant data, including
assumptions on timing and future capital and operating expenditure to the five year plan.
Based on our procedures, we consider management’s key assumptions to be within a
reasonable range of our own expectations and the related disclosures in Note 13 to the
financial statements to be adequate.

Key audit matter
Recognition of vendor allowances
The Group receives various types of vendor allowances from its
suppliers, as further disclosed in Note 2 and Note 3 to the financial
statements. These allowances are a significant component of cost
of sales. The vendor allowance receivable at December 31, 2017,
amounts to €454 million (Note 17).
The vendor allowance agreements with suppliers contain volumerelated allowances, promotional and marketing allowances and
various other fees and discounts received in connection with the
purchase of goods for resale from those suppliers. The Group
recognizes vendor allowances as a reduction in cost of sales when
the performance conditions associated with the allowances have
been met, for example when the product has been sold, placed or
when the marketing campaign has been held.
We considered this to be a key audit matter because of the
magnitude of amounts involved and the judgment required from
management to determine the nature and level of fulfilment of
the Company’s obligations under the vendor agreements and
to recognize the amounts in the correct period. This requires a
detailed understanding of the contractual arrangements in addition
to complete and accurate data to estimate purchase and sales
volumes and fulfilment of promotional programs.

Investors

Ahold Delhaize Annual Report 2017

246

How our audit addressed the matter
Our procedures included evaluating the design and testing the operating effectiveness
of management’s controls around the completeness and accuracy of the contractual
agreements recognized in the accounting system.
Furthermore we challenged management’s assumptions used in determining the vendor
allowances through discussions with management and performing the following specific
substantive audit procedures. On a sample basis we agreed the recorded amounts to the
vendor contracts and/or supporting documentation and confirmed the related positions
and terms with the vendors. In addition, to evaluate the reliability of management’s
estimates, we performed a retrospective review of management judgments by testing
subsequent collections on prior period vendor allowance receivables. Finally we tested
cut-off through assessing the obligation fulfilment of vendor allowances recorded during
a period before and after year-end.
Based on our procedures we did not identify material exceptions and we found
management’s recognition of vendor allowances to be supported by available evidence.

Key audit matter

How our audit addressed the matter

Employee benefit plan measurement and disclosures
The Group has defined benefit plans, primarily in the Netherlands
and in and the U.S., giving rise to defined benefit obligations of
€4.8 billion and €1.4 billion, respectively (Note 23).

Our procedures included understanding and evaluating the design and testing the
operating effectiveness of controls related to key inputs (such as payroll data) and key
outputs of the Group’s pension process.

The Group also has a significant number of union employees in the
U.S. whose pension benefits are covered by multi-employer plans
(we also refer to the risk factor on pension plan funding on page
114 of the Annual Report). In Note 23 management has disclosed
a calculation, which is based on certain assumptions and leads to
an estimate of the Group’s possible proportionate share of the total
net deficit in these plans.
We considered this to be a key audit matter because of the
magnitude of the amounts involved, management’s significant
judgment applied in estimating the actuarial and demographic
assumptions (the most relevant being around salary increases,
inflation, discount rates and mortality rates) and the technical
expertise required to measure the resulting defined benefit
pension obligation for the Group and multi-employer
plan disclosure.

We tested the actuarial and demographic assumptions and valuation methodologies
used by management to determine the Group’s various pension obligations.
We evaluated whether the key actuarial assumptions are reasonable (for example
by comparing to the published actuarial tables) and consistently applied. We tested
payroll data, through a combination of controls and test of details, and reconciled the
membership census data used in the actuarial models to the payroll data.
In addition, we evaluated the potential exposure under the multi-employer plans in the
U.S. as disclosed in Note 23. We reconciled the related inputs used by management
to determine the Group’s possible proportionate share of the total net deficit in these
plans to supporting documentation such as the latest available plan information and
actuarial calculations.
Finally, we assessed the adequacy of disclosures related to the employee benefit plans.
Our procedures did not identify material exceptions and we considered management’s
key assumptions to be within a reasonable range of our own expectations.

Report on the other information included in the annual report
In addition to the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon, the Annual Report contains other information that consists of:
• The Management Report as defined on page 120 of the Annual Report
• The other information included in Message from our CEO, Who we are, World around us, Business review, Governance, Sustainability performance
and Investor sections and
• The other information pursuant to Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.
Based on the procedures performed as set out below, we conclude that the other information:
• Is consistent with the financial statements and does not contain material misstatements
• Contains the information that is required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.
We have read the other information. Based on our knowledge and understanding obtained in our audit of the financial statements or otherwise, we have
considered whether the other information contains material misstatements.
By performing our procedures, we comply with the requirements of Part 9 Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code and the Dutch Standard 720. The scope of such
procedures was substantially less than the scope of those performed in our audit of the financial statements.
The Management Board is responsible for the preparation of the other information, including the Management Report and the other information in accordance
with Part 9 Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.

Report on other legal and regulatory requirements
Our appointment
We were appointed as auditors of Koninklijke Ahold Delhaize N.V. by the Supervisory Board following the passing of a resolution by the shareholders
at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on April 16, 2013. The appointment has been renewed annually by shareholders representing a total period
of uninterrupted engagement appointment of five years.
No prohibited non-audit services
To the best of our knowledge and belief, we have not provided prohibited non-audit services as referred to in Article 5(1) of the European Regulation on
specific requirements regarding statutory audit of public interest entities.
Services rendered
The non-audit services, in addition to the audit, that we have provided to the company and its controlled entities, for the period to which our statutory audit
relates, are disclosed in Note 4 of the notes to the parent company financial statements.
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Responsibilities of the Management Board and the Supervisory Board for the financial statements
The Management Board is responsible for:
• The preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with EU-IFRS and with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code;
• Such internal control as the Management Board determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
As part of the preparation of the financial statements, the Management Board is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going
concern. Based on the financial reporting frameworks mentioned, the Management Board should prepare the financial statements using the goingconcern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
The Management Board should disclose events and circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern
in the financial statements.
The Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.
Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our responsibility is to plan and perform an audit engagement in a manner that allows us to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence to provide a
basis for our opinion. Our audit opinion aims to provide reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.
Reasonable assurance is a high but not absolute level of assurance which makes it possible that we may not detect all misstatements. Misstatements may
arise due to fraud or error. They are considered to be material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic
decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.
Materiality affects the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and the evaluation of the effect of identified misstatements on our opinion.
A more detailed description of our responsibilities is set out in the appendix to our report.

In addition to what is included in our auditor’s report we have further set out in this appendix our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements and
explained what an audit involves.
The auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
We have exercised professional judgment and have maintained professional scepticism throughout the audit in accordance with Dutch Standards on Auditing,
ethical requirements and independence requirements. Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Our audit consisted, among other things of the following:
• Identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designing and performing audit
procedures responsive to those risks, and obtaining audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not
detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,
misrepresentations, or the intentional override of internal control.
• Obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for
the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control.
• Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the
Management Board.
• Concluding on the appropriateness of the Management Board’s use of the going concern basis of accounting, and based on the audit evidence obtained,
concluding whether a material uncertainty exists related to events and/or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the company’s ability to continue as
a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the
financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date
of our auditor’s report and are made in the context of our opinion on the financial statements as a whole. However, future events or conditions may cause the
company to cease to continue as a going concern.
• Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and evaluating whether the financial
statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
Considering our ultimate responsibility for the opinion on the company’s consolidated financial statements we are responsible for the direction, supervision and
performance of the group audit. In this context, we have determined the nature and extent of the audit procedures for components of the group to ensure that
we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole. Determining factors are the geographic structure of the group,
the significance and / or risk profile of group entities or activities, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the group operates. On this
basis, we selected group entities for which an audit or review of financial information or specific balances was considered necessary.
We communicate with the Supervisory Board regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings,
including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. In this respect we also issue an additional report to the Audit,
Finance and Risk Committee in accordance with Article 11 of the EU Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest entities.
The information included in this additional report is consistent with our audit opinion in this auditor’s report.
We provide the Supervisory Board with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate
with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with the Supervisory Board, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements
of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public
disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, not communicating the matter is in the public interest.

Scope and methodology
This section presents Ahold
Delhaize’s 2017 performance
against its Sustainable Retailing
strategy and targets. Like 2016,
this year continued to be a time
of transition and integration.
Our businesses shared expertise
and worked closely together to
make Ahold Delhaize an even
more sustainable company.

During 2017, as we continued to improve our
strategic alignment across the company, we built
on the strong heritage of sustainable retailing at
both Ahold and Delhaize Group. While it is not
feasible to combine our pre-merger performance
from prior years for Ahold Delhaize’s brands, our
2016 baseline helps us to show clear performance
trends for the combined company.

From an operational scope perspective, the data
includes the following parts of the business, unless
specifically noted otherwise:

Enabling all our brands to report fully on all
Sustainable Retailing performance indicators was
a high priority for 2017, but we have more work to
do in 2018 to reach this goal.

• Company-owned distribution centers, including
all transportation from distribution centers to
stores, regardless of whether the transportation
companies are owned by Ahold Delhaize

The segments and businesses included in
this report’s data are all brands except bol.
com, Peapod, Etos and Gall & Gall. In 2016,
the Sustainable Retailing data included Super
Indo, a joint venture. In 2017, our data excludes
Super Indo to better align with the scope of our
financial reporting.

In our 2016 reporting, not all brands were able to
report on all indicators, as they were in the process
of adjusting their internal measurement systems to
Ahold Delhaize definitions or were creating new
data collection processes. When full alignment
in reporting for an indicator was not achieved for
2016, we have explained it in the footnotes (a 2016
overview of included companies per indicator is
also included on our website).

• All stores (company-owned and franchise /
affiliated stores, except for waste from stores
affiliated with Delhaize Belgium)
• Offices

Global Reporting Initiative
Our sustainability reporting has been prepared in
accordance with the GRI Standards: Core option.
The indicators we have chosen to report on are
derived from an analysis of their relevance and
materiality to the key impacts of our businesses,
and are the ones we believe best measure
progress against our strategic focus areas.
This document has been reviewed by the
Company’s external independent auditor,
PricewaterhouseCoopers Accountants N.V.
A summary of our application of the GRI
Standards is included in GRI Index.

UN Global Compact
The United Nations Global Compact is an
initiative for businesses committed to aligning
their operations and strategies with 10 universally
accepted principles in the areas of human rights,
labor, environment and anti-corruption.
Ahold Delhaize’s own principles align with those
of the Global Compact, and we have incorporated
them into our strategy. We report on our operations
and strategies in relation to these principles.
Our Global Compact table can be found on the
Sustainable Retailing section of Ahold Delhaize’s
website at www.aholddelhaize.com.
Memberships
As a global company, we are members of
and collaborate with industry associations
and partnerships to further sustainability
progress within our industry. Our memberships
include the Consumer Goods Forum (CGF),
the Food Marketing Institute (FMI), the Dutch
Food Retail Association (“Centraal Bureau
Levensmiddelenhandel” or CBL), the European
Retail Round Table (ERRT), Eurocommerce,
and the World Economic Forum (WEF), among
others. Through these memberships, we strive to
improve global health, sustainability, transparency,
compliance monitoring, and the well-being of
workers around the world.

We restated our 2016 figures to correct for errors in our
previous calculations. Using constant exchange rates,
90% our 2016 figure for tonnes of food waste per food sales is
5.36 t/MEUR, resulting in a 1% decrease. We continue to
focus on reducing and recycling food waste. Our large
increases in food waste recycled for biogas generation
were driven by our Giant Carlisle and Hannaford brands.
As part of our commitment as a member of the Consumer
Goods Forum, we aim to reduce food waste sent to disposal
by 50% between 2016-2020.
In 2017, compared to 2016, every local business increased
their percentage of unsold food donated to feed people.
Food Lion and Hannaford made the most significant positive
impact on these figures.

In 2016, we reported on private label products, which are
a sub-set of Ahold Delhaize own brands, consisting only
of products with a visible proprietary label from an Ahold
Delhaize brand. In 2017, all brands reported on the full range
of own brands, which accounts for the slight decrease in
production units of own-brand products that are GFSI-certified
or that comply with an acceptable level of assurance standard.

In 2016, we reported on private label products, which are a subset of Ahold Delhaize own brands, consisting only of products

In 2017, almost all brands reported on own brands. Our brands
increased the percentage of production units of own-brand
products in high-risk countries that are audited against an
acceptable standard.

7 2016 figures for the following brands refer to private label products, which are a sub-set of Ahold Delhaize own brands, consisting of products with a visible proprietary label from an Ahold Delhaize brand: Delhaize America, Mega Image, Delhaize Serbia and Alfa Beta.
2016 figures for Mega Image and Delhaize Serbia do not include products sourced from other Ahold Delhaize brands. The exclusion of Super Indo in 2017 figures results in a 1.6 percentage point increase in percentage of production units for own-brand food products that
are certified according to a GFSI recognized standard, and a 1.3 percentage point decrease in percentage of production units for own-brand food products that comply with an acceptable level of assurance standard (other than GFSI).

We progressed well against our sustainable commodities
targets, with the exception of flat figures for sustainably
sourced seafood.

As part of our strategic commitment to Best Own Brands, we
have added tracking for our own-brand lines of free-from and
organic products.

10 2016 data excludes Mega Image and Super Indo.
11 2016 data excludes Delhaize America, Alfa Beta, Mega Image and Super Indo. In 2020, the target is set at 100% for products containing more than 25% cocoa. For products containing less than 25% cocoa, the target is set at 75%.
12 2016 data is estimated. For 2016 figures, Alfa Beta reported only on private label products. Super Indo has a large impact on our palm oil figures, and the exclusion of Super Indo in 2017’s reporting accounts for a 12 percentage point increase in our figures
for percentage of palm oil volume certified to RSPO Mass Balance or RSPO Segregated. 100% of Super Indo’s palm oil footprint is covered by RSPO Book & Claim.
13 2016 data excludes Albert Heijn, Albert, and Ahold USA. 2016 Mega Image figures do not include products that are sourced directly from other Ahold Delhaize brands.

15 As a correction to the 2016 report wording, all figures related to seafood are in percentage of sales, not in percentage of products.
16 2016 data excludes Albert Heijn, Albert and Super Indo. As a correction to the 2016 report wording, all figures related to seafood are in percentage of sales, not in percentage of products.

Commentary

We prioritized reducing emissions from refrigerants in 2017,
focusing on leak reductions and increasing the use of natural
445 refrigerants. We now account for emissions from franchise /
affiliated stores in Scope 3 reporting.
In 2016, we reported Q4 2015 through Q3 2016 data for our
CO2 equivalent emissions data. We revised our 2016 data, and
it now follows the calendar year like the rest of our reporting.

19 All 2016 figures have been revised to follow calendar year reporting like the rest of our reporting. Additionally, we restated errors found in our 2016 data. 2016 figures exclude Super Indo.

Commentary

We prioritized reducing emissions from refrigerants in
2017, focusing on leak reductions and increasing the use
of natural refrigerants.
In 2016, we reported Q4 2015 through Q3 2016 data for
our CO2 -equivalent emissions data. We revised our 2016
data, and it now follows the calendar year like the rest of
our reporting.

Commentary

We adjusted our indicators for donations in 2017 to show a
clearer distinction between donations given through onetime events versus donations through long-term community
partnerships and charitable activities linked to core
business activities.
We break down donations into three main vehicles: direct cash
donations by Ahold Delhaize and our brands, cash equivalent
of in-kind donations, and donations by customers facilitated
by Ahold Delhaize brands. We prioritize cash equivalent
donations, such as in-kind giving of products and associate
volunteering. Additionally, in 2016, we included donations
through commercial initiatives and these are excluded in 2017.

Acceptable standards and certifications
for commodities
Ahold Delhaize defines acceptable standards
as multi-stakeholder initiatives, or standards
supported by multiple stakeholders. They include
third-party verification and focus on mitigating
the main environmental and social issues
associated with a commodity’s production.
Acceptable standards are science-based,
globally consistent and focus on continuously
improving production and supply chain practices.
Acceptable standards for tea, coffee, and
cocoa include UTZ Certification, Rainforest
Alliance, Fairtrade USA / Fairtrade International
or equivalent standards. Acceptable standards
for palm oil include Roundtable on Sustainable
Palm Oil (RSPO) Principles & Criteria, Rainforest
Alliance SAN Standard or equivalent standards.
Acceptable standards for wood fiber are the
Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) Chain of
Custody, Program for Endorsement of Forest
Certification (PEFC) Grade A standards,
Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) or equivalent
standards. Acceptable standards for soy are
Roundtable on Responsible Soy (RTRS) standard
for Responsible Soy Production, ProTerra, or
equivalent. We purchase area-based RTRS credits
from the Cerrado Region. Acceptable standards
for seafood products include certification
against a program that is recognized by the
Global Sustainable Seafood Initiative (GSSI)
or Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC)
farm standards.
Associate engagement survey
Associate engagement is measured through
an annual associate engagement survey
administered to all associates employed by Ahold
Delhaize brands. A number of items in the survey
are used to derive and calculate an associate
engagement score.

Carbon footprint methodology and data scope
The carbon footprint methodology follows the
guidelines of the World Business Council for
Sustainable Development (WBCSD) / World
Resources Institute (WRI) Greenhouse Gas (GHG)
Protocol regarding corporate greenhouse gas
accounting and reporting. Our Ahold Delhaize
carbon footprint reporting takes into account
Scope 1, Scope 2 and limited Scope 3 emissions.
Scope 1 (direct GHG emissions): emissions from
sources that are owned or controlled by Ahold
Delhaize. Scope 1 emissions include emissions
from refrigerant leakages, owned trucking and
on-site fuel usage (natural gas, propane, light fuel).
Scope 2 (indirect GHG emissions): emissions from
the generation of purchased electricity, heat or
steam consumed by the company. They are not
“direct” emissions in that they arise from third-party
installations but are attributed to the company’s
operations as the end user of the electricity, heat
or steam.
Limited Scope 3 (other indirect emissions):
emissions from franchise / affiliated stores;
trucking emissions from subcontracted trucks
that deliver Ahold Delhaize products from
operated distribution centers to stores.
and estimated emissions from franchise stores.

The Group’s total CO2 -equivalent emissions and
energy figures include all energy and related
emissions data as defined by the scopes above,
including data from facilities that closed or opened
during 2017.
We use the latest available emission factors in
our reporting. We source electricity emission
factors from the International Energy Agency (IEA,
2017 edition; 2015 data) for European countries
and from GHG Protocol 2014 (based on eGrid
2012 values, issued in May 2015 by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency – EPA) for the
United States. We source fuel emission factors
from GHG Protocol 2014 wherever available
and otherwise from other appropriate sources.
For refrigerant leakages, we apply the Global
Warming Potentials (GWP) for refrigerants available
from Bitzer International 2014 wherever available
and otherwise from other appropriate sources,
such as the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate
Change (IPCC).
We do not extend our reporting to include all
Scope 3 emissions, but we work with our peer
companies and suppliers to better understand
the climate change impact we have throughout
our entire value chain. Scope 3 defined by the
GHG Protocol accounts for all the remaining
emissions that result from our activities, ranging
from products transportation to affiliated stores
to emissions from our supply chain, including
emissions from growing and packaging the food
we sell.
CO2 emissions / CO2 equivalent (CO2e)
The CO2 (Carbon Dioxide) emissions data we
report consists of a calculated CO2 equivalent:
actual CO2 emitted plus equivalent emissions
from other greenhouse gases (such as CH4,
N2O and F-gases).

Investors

Location-based approach
The GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance defines
the location-based approach as “a method that
reflects the average emissions intensity of grids
on which energy consumption occurs (using
mostly grid-average emission factor data).”
Market-based approach
The GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance defines
the market-based approach as “a method that
reflects emissions from electricity that companies
have purposefully chosen (or their lack of choice).
It derives emission factors from contractual
instruments, which include any type of contract
between two parties for the sale and purchase of
energy bundled with attributes about the energy
generation, or for unbundled attribute claims.
Markets differ as to what contractual instruments
are commonly available or used by companies to
purchase energy or claim specific attributes about
it, but they can include energy attribute certificates
(RECs, GOs, etc.), direct contracts (for both
low-carbon, renewable, or fossil fuel generation),
supplier-specific emission rates, and other default
emission factors representing the untracked or
unclaimed energy and emissions (termed the
‘residual mix’) if a company does not have other
contractual information that meets the Scope 2
Quality Criteria.”
Food Loss and Waste Protocol
A multi-stakeholder effort to develop the global
accounting and reporting standard (known as
the FLW Standard) for quantifying food and
associated inedible parts removed from the food
supply chain (referred to for simplicity sake as
“food loss and waste”). For more information,
see www.flwprotocol.org.
Food waste
As defined by the Food and Agriculture
Organization of the United Nations (FAO), food
waste is any removal of food from the food supply
chain which is or was at some point fit for human
consumption, but has been disposed of, or has
spoiled or expired, mainly as a result of economic

Ahold Delhaize Annual Report 2017

264

behavior, poor stock management or neglect.
In our calculations, in contrast to shrink, food
waste excludes donations from hunger relief
organizations, theft, and cash shortages.
Front-of-pack nutritional labeling
Nutritional labeling (showing the amount of
certain nutrients) that is on the front of a product
package. At a minimum, it comprises the calories
per serving.
GFSI
Global Food Safety Initiative: a CGF activity that
enables continuous improvement of food safety
management across the supply chain, through
benchmarking, collaboration and harmonization
of food safety certification programs.
Greenhouse gases
Gases such as carbon dioxide or methane that
contribute to climate change.
Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)
An independent international not-for-profit
organization that developed the GRI Sustainability
Reporting Standards and works to support
their implementation.

Global Sustainable Seafood Initiative (GSSI)
A global platform and partnership of seafood
companies, NGOs, experts and governmental
and intergovernmental organizations working
towards more sustainable seafood for everyone.
GSSI’s Global Benchmark Tool includes GSSI
Essential Components that are based on the Code
of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries (CCRF) and
the FAO Guidelines and that seafood certification
schemes must meet to be recognized by GSSI.
Global Warming Potential (GWP)
Defined by the GHG Protocol as “a factor
describing the radiative forcing impact (degree
of harm to the atmosphere) of one unit of a
given GHG relative to one unit of CO2.” By using
GWP, GHG emissions can be standardized to
a carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) that allows
expressing the emissions of different GHGs using
carbon dioxide as a reference. For example, for
a 100-year time horizon, the impact of one unit of
methane is 25 times greater than one unit of CO2
(according to IPCC’s 4th assessment report).
Hence, methane’s global warming potential (GWP)
is 25. Average GWP is the GWP of all refrigerants
we use in our systems (including stores and
distribution centers) weighted in relation to their
total charge.

Investors

Average GWP
The GWP of all refrigerants we use in our systems
(including stores and distribution centers)
weighted in relation to their total charge.
Healthy products
Products that meet nutritional criteria as
determined by Guiding Stars (in the U.S.)
and Choices nutrition criteria (in Europe).
See guidingstars.com or
www.choicesprogramme.org.
Last-stage of production unit
The entity that performs the last stage of
production or processing in the supply chain
where food and non-food safety and / or working
conditions are impacted. The last stage of
production (LSOP) is:
• For food safety: the location where the final
consumer product (including packing)
is handled.
• For non-food safety: the location where the
final consumer product (excluding packing)
is assembled.
• For social compliance: the location where labor
is involved in producing or processing the
final product – (re-)packing in a non-high-risk
country is excluded.

Materiality matrix
In a materiality matrix, social, environmental
and economic issues are plotted along two
dimensions: their influence on stakeholder
assessments and decisions and the significance
of Ahold Delhaize’s social, environmental and
economic impact on these topics.
MSC / ASC certification
MSC (Marine Stewardship Council) and ASC
(Aquaculture Stewardship Council) certificates
are sustainable seafood programs ensuring
seafood sourcing practices that do not endanger
the existence of fish species and rewarding
responsible aquaculture.
National brands
Product that are distributed nationally under a
brand name owned by the producer or distributor.
Own brands
Own-brand products, at Ahold Delhaize
company-operated and affiliated stores, include:
private labels, fancy brands (proprietary private
labels that are a fantasy name owned by Ahold
Delhaize), exclusive brands (brands that are not
international, national or regional brands), storeprepared products (in-store food preparation,
even if derived from branded stock), non-branded
products (such as bulk fruit and vegetables or no
name non-food products) and promotional items
relating to the former. In short, every product that
is not an international, national or regional brand is
considered to be an own-brand product.

Ozone-friendly refrigerant
A refrigerant that has no ozone depletion potential
(ODP=0), meaning there is no degradation to
the ozone layer. The data are based on the
2015 Report from United Nations Environment
Programme (UNEP), “TOC Refrigeration, A/C and
Heat Pumps Assessment Report 2015.”
Palm oil RSPO-certified
The Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO)
initiated a certification program to promote the use
of sustainable palm oil, with different supply chain
options: RSPO Segregated, RSPO Mass Balance
and RSPO Book & Claim. RSPO Segregated
certifies that palm oil only comes from RSPOcertified palm plantations. RSPO Mass Balance
certifies that palm oil comes from a mix of
RSPO-certified and -uncertified palm plantations.
RSPO Book & Claim enables companies to buy
credits from RSPO-certified growers, crushers and
independent smallholders. To comply with RSPO
Certification requirements, any supplier that uses
palm-based ingredients must be RSPO Chain of
Custody-Certified, and purchase RSPO-Certified
(Mass Balance or Segregated) palm oil.
Private label products
Private label products are a sub-set of Ahold
Delhaize own brands, consisting of products
with a visible proprietary label from an Ahold
Delhaize brand.
Rate of lost days due to accidents
Number of days lost that are directly related to
work-related accidents per 200,000 hours worked.
The number of days lost are days scheduled to be
worked according to each associate’s schedule.
An accident is a non-fatal or fatal injury arising in
the course of work.
Sales area
Sales area is the sum of the store areas in square
meters, taken at the end of the year, where
products are sold and services provided.

Investors

Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
The United Nations SDGs are a universal call
to action to end poverty, protect the planet and
ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity.
United Nations Global Compact
An initiative for businesses committed to aligning
their operations and strategies with 10 universally
accepted principles in the areas of human rights,
labor, environmental and anti-corruption.
Waste
“Total Waste Generated” includes all waste,
regardless of the waste management (recycling,
incineration or landfill). It is broken down by
percentage sent to landfill, recycled, and sent
to incinerators that produce energy. Waste data
covers all types of facilities (stores, distribution
centers, and offices). Information about all
waste disposal methods has been determined
through information provided by the waste
disposal contractors.
Waste recycling
All methods that do not include sending waste to
landfill or incineration. For food waste, this includes
four methods: recycling through animal feed,
recycling through anaerobic digestion for energy,
composting and rendering. For other waste
streams, such as cardboard, paper, plastic and
other waste, recycling refers to applied methods
for each specific waste type.

To: the Management Board and the Supervisory Board of Koninklijke Ahold Delhaize N.V.

Assurance report on the sustainability information 2017

Our conclusion
Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the sustainability information included in the Annual Report of Koninklijke
Ahold Delhaize N.V. does not present, in all material respects, a reliable and adequate view of:
• the policy and business operations with regard to sustainability; and
• the events and achievements related thereto for the year ended December 31, 2017;
in accordance with the Sustainability Reporting Standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the internally applied reporting criteria.
What we have reviewed
The sustainability information contains a representation of the policy and business operations of Koninklijke Ahold Delhaize N.V., Zaandam, the Netherlands
(hereafter: “Ahold Delhaize”) regarding sustainability and the events and achievements related thereto for 2017.
We have reviewed the sustainability information for the period January 2, 2017 until December 31, 2017, as included in the following sections in the Annual
Report of Ahold Delhaize:
• Message from our CEO (page 5 to 8);
• the Who we are section (page 10 to 20);
• the World around us section (page 22 to 26);
• the Business review section (page 28 to 57); and
• the Sustainability performance section (page 251 to 276);
(hereafter together referred to as “the sustainability information”).
The links to external sources or websites in the sustainability information are not part of the sustainability information itself reviewed by us. We do not provide
assurance over information outside of this Annual Report.
The basis for our conclusion
We conducted our review in accordance with Dutch law, including Dutch Standard 3810N ‘Assurance engagements on corporate social responsibility
reports’ (‘Assurance-opdrachten inzake maatschappelijke verslagen’), which is a specified Dutch standard that is based on the International Standard on
Assurance Engagements 3000: ’Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information. This review is aimed to obtain limited
assurance. Our responsibilities under this standard are further described in the section ‘Our responsibilities for the review of the sustainability information of this
assurance report.
We believe that the assurance information we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion.
Independence and quality control
We are independent of Ahold Delhaize in accordance with the “Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to independence”
(“Verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assurance-opdrachten” – ViO) and other relevant independence requirements in the
Netherlands. Furthermore we have complied with the “Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to rules of professional conduct”
(“Verordening gedrags- en beroepsregels accountants” – VGBA).
We apply the “detailed rules for quality systems” (“Nadere voorschriften kwaliteitsystemen”) and accordingly maintain a comprehensive system of quality
control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and other applicable legal
and regulatory requirements.

273

Reporting criteria
Ahold Delhaize developed its reporting criteria on the basis of the Sustainability Reporting Standards of GRI, as disclosed on page 267-271 of the Annual
Report. The information in the scope of this assurance engagement needs to be read and understood in conjunction with these reporting criteria as disclosed
on page 263-266 of the Annual Report. The Management Board is responsible for selecting and applying these reporting criteria. The absence of a significant
body of established practice on which to draw, to evaluate and measure non-financial information allows for different, but acceptable, measurement techniques
and can affect comparability between entities and over time.
Inherent limitations
The sustainability information includes prospective information such as expectations on ambitions, strategy, plans, estimates and risk assessments based
on assumptions. Inherently, the actual results are likely to differ from these expectations. These differences may be material. We do not provide any assurance
on the assumptions and achievability of prospective information in the sustainability information.
Our review approach
Materiality
Based on our professional judgment we determined specific materiality levels for each relevant part of the sustainability information and the sustainability
information as a whole. When evaluating our materiality levels, we have taken into account quantitative and qualitative aspects and the relevance of information
for both stakeholders and the organization.
Based on professional judgment, we determined materiality levels for specific quantitative information within a bandwidth of 5% to 7.5% for topics where
Ahold Delhaize has a high or very significant impact on society and influence on stakeholder decisions according to the in the materiality analysis on page 50
of the Annual Report 2017 and 7.5% to 10% for topics with a moderate to low impact.
Scope of the group review
Ahold Delhaize reports on the sustainability information on a consolidated level. For more details reference is made to page 254 of the Annual Report.
Our review focused on the significant components, being Ahold USA, Delhaize America, Albert Heijn and Delhaize Belgium. The majority of review procedures
for this assurance engagement were performed by the central sustainability review team. Review procedures for Ahold USA, Delhaize America and Delhaize
Belgium were performed by this central team with support from local team members.
Where the work was performed by local team members, we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in their work to be able to conclude whether
sufficient appropriate evidence had been obtained as a basis for our conclusion on the consolidated sustainability information. The consolidation is reviewed by
the central sustainability review team at the head office in Zaandam, the Netherlands.
Key review matter
Key review matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our review of the sustainability information. We have
communicated the key review matter to the Management Board and Supervisory Board. The key review matter is not a comprehensive reflection of all matters
discussed. We described the key review matter and included a summary of the review procedures we performed on this matter.
This key review matter is addressed in the context of our review of the sustainability information as a whole, and in forming our conclusion thereon. We do not
provide a separate conclusion on this matter or on specific elements of the sustainability reporting. Any comments we make on the results of our procedures
should be read in this context.
The context of our review is set by the Group’s 2017 sustainable retailing performance and operations. As the Delhaize merger was finalized in 2016, the key
review matter related to ‘the impact of the merger between Koninklijke Ahold N.V. and Delhaize Group NV/SA’ has been removed. Instead, the ‘consistent
application of KPI definitions across the Group and over time’ has been added to highlight our focus on the important aspect of strategic alignment across the
brands in the first year after the merger.

Key review matter

How our review addressed the matter

Consistent and correct application of KPI definitions across
the Group and over time
As further disclosed on page 254 of the Annual Report, in 2017
the company continued to improve their strategic alignment
across the brands since the merger in 2016. An important aspect
hereof, concerns consistent KPI definitions throughout the group
as required by GRI. For example, management has issued
additional guidance on definitions set in 2016 to further facilitate
the consistent KPI reporting by the brands.

In addition to our planned inquiries and analytical procedures, we have performed
additional review procedures that focus on assessing the consistent application
of definitions, compliance with GRI, reporting criteria per KPI per brand, and the
adequacy of the disclosures in the annual report in the event of identified inconsistencies
or changes.

For indicators where the Ahold Delhaize definition differed from
what was historically reported by the individual brands, they
went through a process of adjusting their internal data collection
processes or created new processes. At the moment, for some
of the indicators, brands use – in part – manual data collection
processes to adhere to the reporting requirements
of the company.
We considered this alignment process a key review matter as
the use of consistent definitions (and scoping) is one of the key
elements for adequate reporting on sustainability information.
In addition, manual data collection processes are inherently
more prone to error than automated processes.

These review procedures included, amongst others, developing an understanding
of management’s data reporting process and related internal controls, management
inquiries on fluctuations identified and reconciliations to the input data of the reporting
system for all indicators.
In addition, we have performed additional procedures for KPIs related to material topics
such as ‘promote healthier eating’, ‘reduce food waste’, ‘climate impact’, ‘safety at work’
and ‘local community connection’ as they (in our risk assessment) were considered to
be more susceptible to inconsistency or manual data collection errors.

Responsibilities for the sustainability information and the assurance-engagement
Responsibilities of the Management Board and the Supervisory Board
The Management Board of Ahold Delhaize is responsible for the preparation of the sustainability information in accordance with the Sustainability Reporting
Standards of GRI and the internally applied reporting criteria as disclosed on page 263-271 of the Annual Report, including the identification of stakeholders
and the definition of material subjects. The choices made by the Management Board regarding the scope of the sustainability information and the reporting
policy are summarized in section ‘Scope & Methodology’ of the sustainability performance section in the Annual Report. The Management Board is responsible
for determining that the applicable reporting criteria are acceptable in the circumstances.
The Management Board is also responsible for such internal control as it determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the sustainability information that
is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or errors.
The Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the company’s reporting process on the sustainability information.
Our responsibilities for the review of the sustainability information
Our responsibility is to plan and perform the review engagement to obtain sufficient and appropriate assurance information to provide a basis for
our conclusion.
This review engagement is aimed at obtaining limited assurance. In obtaining a limited level of assurance, the performed procedures are aimed at determining
the plausibility of information and are less extensive than those aimed at obtaining reasonable assurance in an audit engagement. The assurance obtained in
review engagements aimed at obtaining limited assurance is therefore significantly lower than the assurance obtained in assurance engagements aimed at
obtaining reasonable assurance.
Misstatements may arise due to irregularities, including fraud or error and are considered to be material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the sustainability information. The materiality affects the nature,
timing and extent of our review and the evaluation of the effect of identified misstatements on our conclusion.

Procedures performed
We have exercised professional judgment and have maintained professional scepticism throughout the assurance engagement, in accordance with the
Dutch Standard 3810N, ethical requirements and independence requirements.
Our main procedures include:
• Performing an external environment analysis and obtaining insight into relevant social themes and issues, relevant laws and regulations and the
characteristics of the organization.
• Evaluating the appropriateness of the reporting policy and its consistent application, including the evaluation of the results of the stakeholders’ dialogue
and the reasonableness of estimates made by management and related disclosures in the sustainability information.
• Evaluating the design of the reporting systems and processes related to the sustainability information.
• Developing an understanding of internal control relevant to the assurance engagement in order to design assurance procedures that are appropriate
in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing a conclusion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control.
• Evaluating whether the sustainability information represents the underlying transactions and events free from material misstatement.
• Interviewing relevant staff at corporate and local level responsible for the sustainability strategy, policy and performance of sustainability operations.
• Interviewing relevant staff at corporate level, responsible for providing the information in the sustainability information, carrying out internal control
procedures on the data and consolidating the data in the sustainability information.
• Visits to entities in Belgium and the United States to evaluate the source data and to evaluate the design and implementation of control and validation
procedures at local level.
• An analytical review of the data and trends submitted for consolidation at corporate level.
• Reviewing internal and external documentation to determine whether the sustainability information, including the disclosure, presentation and assertions
made in the sustainability information, is substantiated adequately.
• Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the sustainability information.
• Assessing the consistency of the sustainability information and the information in the Annual Report not in scope for this assurance report.
• Assessing whether the sustainability information has been prepared ‘in accordance’ with GRI.
From the matters communicated with Ahold Delhaize we determine one matter that was of most significance in the review of the sustainability information and is
therefore the key review matter. We describe this matter in our assurance report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when,
in extremely rare circumstances, not mentioning it is in the public interest.

by the terms of the shares.

Share buyback

This share buyback program was completed on December 29, 2017. On November 8, 2017, Ahold Delhaize announced the decision to return an additional

Share capital

During 2017, Ahold Delhaize’s issued share
capital outstanding decreased by approximately
44 million common shares to 1,228 million
common shares.
The decrease results mainly from the share
buyback of €1 billion as announced in December
2016, partly offset by the issuance of shares
for the share-based compensation program
and conversion of cumulative preferred
financing shares.
The common shares issued decreased by
34 million to 1,247 million at the end of 2017.
The difference between the common shares
outstanding and common shares issued are the
treasury shares.
As of December 31, 2017, there were 19 million
shares held in treasury, the majority held by
Ahold Delhaize to cover the equity-based longterm incentive plan.
Ahold Delhaize’s authorized share capital
as of December 31, 2017, was comprised of
the following:
• 1,923,515,827 common shares at €0.01 par
value each
• 326,484,000 cumulative preferred financing
shares at €0.01 par value each
• 2,250,000,000 cumulative preferred shares
at €0.01 par value each
