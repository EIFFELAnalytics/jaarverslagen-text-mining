Under the updated strategy, Deere will build on its global

BEING A POWER FOR GOOD
Wherever we operate, Deere and its employees are
committed to sharing with others and being a Power for
Good. During the year, the company and its foundation
made charitable contributions of approximately $38 million,
helping improve lives throughout the world. These
contributions are made with purpose; they focus on
empowering smallholder farmers, helping local communities
thrive, and providing educational opportunities for all.
As in past years, Deere employees supported their

MANAGEMENT‚ÄôS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
through pricing and cost management. The company‚Äôs
performance has allowed for significant investments in new
products and services, especially those focused on precision
technologies, and for providing shareholder returns through
dividend payments and share repurchases. The company
believes it remains well positioned to capitalize on the growth
in the world‚Äôs agricultural and construction equipment markets.
In addition, the company is confident in the present direction
and believes it is positioned to deliver improved operating
performance and value to its customers and investors in the
future.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED
OCTOBER 28, 2018, OCTOBER 29, 2017, AND OCTOBER 30,
2016
OVERVIEW
Organization
The company‚Äôs equipment operations generate revenues and
cash primarily from the sale of equipment to John Deere
dealers and distributors. The equipment operations
manufacture and distribute a full line of agricultural
equipment; a variety of commercial and consumer equipment;
and a broad range of equipment for construction, road
building, and forestry. The company‚Äôs financial services
primarily provide credit services, which mainly finance sales
and leases of equipment by John Deere dealers and trade
receivables purchased from the equipment operations. In
addition, financial services offers extended equipment
warranties. The information in the following discussion is
presented in a format that includes information grouped as
consolidated, equipment operations, and financial services. The
company also views its operations as consisting of two
geographic areas, the U.S. and Canada, and outside the U.S.
and Canada. The company‚Äôs operating segments consist of
agriculture and turf, construction and forestry, and financial
services.
Trends and Economic Conditions
The company‚Äôs agriculture and turf equipment sales increased
15 percent in 2018 and are forecast to increase about
3 percent for 2019. Industry agricultural machinery sales in the
U.S. and Canada for 2019 are forecast to be about the same
to 5 percent higher, compared to 2018. Industry sales in the
European Union (EU)28 member nations are forecast to be
about the same in 2019, while South American industry sales
are projected to be about the same to 5 percent higher from
2018 levels. Asian sales are forecast to be about the same or
decrease slightly in 2019. Industry sales of turf and utility
equipment in the U.S. and Canada are expected to be about
the same to 5 percent higher for 2019. The company‚Äôs
construction and forestry sales increased 78 percent in 2018,
with Wirtgen (see Note 4) adding 53 percent for the year. The
segment‚Äôs sales are forecast to increase about 15 percent in
2019. The forecast includes a full year of Wirtgen sales
compared to 10 months in 2018. Global forestry industry sales
are expected to increase about 10 percent in 2019 compared
to 2018. Net income of the company‚Äôs financial services
operations attributable to Deere & Company in 2019 is
expected to be approximately $630 million.
Items of concern include the uncertainty of the effectiveness
of governmental actions in respect to monetary and fiscal
policies, the impact of sovereign debt, eurozone and Argentine
issues, capital market disruptions, trade agreements, changes
in demand and pricing for used equipment, and geopolitical
events. Significant fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
rates and volatility in the price of many commodities could
also impact the company‚Äôs results.
The company concluded another successful year in which the
performance benefited from a further improvement in market
conditions and a favorable customer response to its products.
At the same time, the company has continued to face cost
pressures for raw materials, which are being addressed

2018 COMPARED WITH 2017
CONSOLIDATED RESULTS
Worldwide net income attributable to Deere & Company in
2018 was $2,368 million, or $7.24 per share diluted ($7.34
basic), compared with $2,159 million, or $6.68 per share
diluted ($6.76 basic), in 2017. Affecting 2018 net income were
increases to the provision for income taxes of $704 million
due to the enactment of U.S. tax reform legislation on
December 22, 2017 (tax reform) (see Note 8). Worldwide net
sales and revenues increased 26 percent to $37,358 million in
2018, compared with $29,738 million in 2017. Net sales of the
worldwide equipment operations rose 29 percent in 2018 to
$33,351 million from $25,885 million last year. The company‚Äôs
acquisition of the Wirtgen Group Holding GmbH (Wirtgen)
(see Note 4) in December 2017 added 12 percent to net sales
for the year. Sales included price realization of 1 percent with
no significant currency translation effect. Equipment net sales
in the United States and Canada increased 25 percent for
2018, with Wirtgen adding 4 percent. Outside the U.S. and
Canada, net sales increased 34 percent for the year, with
Wirtgen adding 22 percent. Currency translation had no
material effect.
Worldwide equipment operations reported operating profit of
$3,684 million in 2018, compared with $2,859 million in 2017.
Wirtgen, whose results are included in 2018 amounts, had
operating profit of $116 million in 2018. Excluding Wirtgen
results, the operating profit improvement was primarily driven
by higher shipment volumes, price realization, and lower
warranty costs, partially offset by higher production costs and
research and development expenses. Additionally, results in
2017 included an impairment charge for international
construction and forestry operations and a gain on the sale of
SiteOne Landscapes Supply, Inc. (SiteOne) (see Note 5).
Net income of the company‚Äôs equipment operations was
$1,404 million for 2018, compared with $1,707 million in 2017.
In addition to the operating factors mentioned above, income
tax adjustments related to tax reform had an unfavorable
impact of $1,045 million for 2018 (see Note 8).
The financial services operations reported net income
attributable to Deere & Company in 2018 of $942 million,
compared with $477 million in 2017. Net income benefited
from a higher average portfolio, a lower provision for credit
losses, and lower losses on lease residual values, partially
offset by less favorable financing spreads. Income tax
adjustments related to tax reform had a favorable effect of
$341 million for 2018. Additional information is presented in
the following discussion of the ‚Äò‚ÄòWorldwide Financial Services
Operations.‚Äô‚Äô

23

The cost of sales to net sales ratio for 2018 and 2017 was
76.7 percent. Price realization and lower warranty claims were
offset by higher production costs.
Finance and interest income increased in 2018 due to a larger
average credit portfolio and higher average interest rates.
Other income decreased in 2018 primarily due to the 2017
gains on the sale of the remaining interest in SiteOne (see
Note 5), partially offset by higher service income largely from
Wirtgen (see Note 4). Research and development expenses
increased as a result of new product and improvement
initiatives, and acquisitions. Selling, administrative and general
expenses increased primarily due to the Wirtgen acquisition
and acquisition related costs, partially offset by voluntary
employee-separation program expenses in 2017 and a lower
provision for credit losses. Interest expense increased in 2018
due to higher average borrowing rates and higher average
borrowings. Other operating expenses increased in 2018
primarily due to higher depreciation of equipment on
operating leases, increased cost of services, mainly from
Wirtgen, and acquisition related costs, partially offset by the
favorable effect of currency translation and lower losses on
lease residual values.
The company has several defined benefit pension plans and
other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans, primarily health
care and life insurance plans. The company‚Äôs costs for these
plans in 2018 were $353 million, compared with $347 million
in 2017. The long-term expected return on plan assets, which
is reflected in these costs, was an expected gain of
6.8 percent in 2018 and 7.2 percent in 2017, or $797 million
and $807 million, respectively. The actual return was a gain of
$322 million in 2018 and $1,563 million in 2017. In 2019, the
expected return will be approximately 6.5 percent. The
company‚Äôs costs under these plans in 2019 are expected to
decrease approximately $125 million. The company makes any
required contributions to the plan assets under applicable
regulations and voluntary contributions from time to time
based on the company‚Äôs liquidity and ability to make
tax-deductible contributions. Total company contributions to
the plans were $1,426 million in 2018 and $428 million in
2017, which include voluntary contributions and direct benefit
payments. The voluntary contributions to plan assets were
$1,305 million in 2018, which included $1,300 million
contributions to the U.S. pension and OPEB plans, and
$301 million in 2017. Total company contributions in 2019 are
expected to be approximately $210 million, which are primarily
direct benefit payments. The company has no significant
required contributions to U.S. pension plan assets in 2019
under applicable funding regulations. See the discussion in
‚Äò‚ÄòCritical Accounting Policies‚Äô‚Äô for more information about
pension and OPEB benefit obligations.
BUSINESS SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA RESULTS
The following discussion relates to operating results by
reportable segment and geographic area. Operating profit is
income before certain external interest expense, certain
foreign exchange gains or losses, income taxes, and corporate
expenses. However, operating profit of the financial services
segment includes the effect of interest expense and foreign
currency exchange gains or losses.

24

Worldwide Agriculture and Turf Operations
The agriculture and turf segment had an operating profit of
$2,816 million for the year, compared with $2,513 million in
2017. Net sales increased 15 percent in 2018 due to higher
shipment volumes, price realization, and lower warranty claims.
Currency translation did not have a significant effect on net
sales. The operating profit improvement was driven by higher
shipment volumes, price realization, and lower warranty related
expenses, partially offset by higher production costs and
research and development expenses. Operating profit in 2017
included gains on the SiteOne sale (see Note 5).
Worldwide Construction and Forestry Operations
The construction and forestry segment operating profit was
$868 million in 2018, compared with $346 million in 2017.
Wirtgen contributed $116 million to operating profit in 2018.
Net sales increased 78 percent in 2018, with Wirtgen adding
53 percent for the year. Net sales were also affected by
higher shipment volumes and lower warranty related claims.
Currency translation did not have a material effect on net
sales. Excluding Wirtgen, the operating profit improvements
were primarily driven by higher shipment volumes and lower
warranty expenses, partially offset by higher production costs.
Additionally, 2017 included an impairment charge for
international operations (see Note 5).
Worldwide Financial Services Operations
The operating profit of the financial services segment was
$792 million in 2018, compared with $715 million in 2017.
Operating profit benefited from a higher average portfolio, a
lower provision for credit losses, and lower losses on lease
residual values, partially offset by less favorable financing
spreads. Total revenues of the financial services operations,
including intercompany revenues, increased 12 percent in 2018.
The average balance of receivables and leases financed was
7 percent higher in 2018, compared with 2017. Interest
expense increased 40 percent in 2018 as a result of higher
average borrowing rates and higher average borrowings. The
financial services operations‚Äô ratio of earnings to fixed charges
was 1.87 to 1 in 2018, compared with 2.12 to 1 in 2017.
Equipment Operations in U.S. and Canada
The equipment operations in the U.S. and Canada had an
operating profit of $2,356 million in 2018, compared with
$1,754 million in 2017. Wirtgen, whose results are included in
2018, had operating profit of $19 million. The increase was
due primarily to higher shipment volumes, price realization,
and lower warranty expenses, partially offset by higher
production costs and research and development expenses. Net
sales increased 25 percent in 2018 due primarily to higher
shipment volumes, with Wirtgen adding 4 percent. The
physical volume of sales, excluding the effect of acquisitions,
increased 20 percent, compared with 2017.
Equipment Operations outside U.S. and Canada
The equipment operations outside the U.S. and Canada
operating profit was $1,328 million in 2018, compared with
$1,105 million in 2017. Wirtgen‚Äôs operating profit outside the
U.S. and Canada was $97 million in 2018. The increase was
due primarily to higher shipment volumes, partially offset by
higher production costs and research and development
expenses. Net sales increased 34 percent in 2018, with
Wirtgen adding 22 percent, compared to 2017. The increase

24

was primarily the result of higher shipment volumes. The
physical volume of sales, excluding the effect of acquisitions,
increased 11 percent, compared with 2017.
MARKET CONDITIONS AND OUTLOOK
Company equipment sales are projected to increase by about
7 percent for fiscal 2019 compared with 2018. Included will be
a full year of Wirtgen sales in 2019 versus 10 months in 2018,
adding about 2 percent to the company‚Äôs sales in 2019.
Foreign currency rates are expected to have an unfavorable
translation effect on equipment sales of about 2 percent for
the year. Net sales and revenues are projected to increase by
about 7 percent for fiscal 2019 with net income attributable to
Deere & Company forecast to be about $3.6 billion.
Agriculture and Turf. The company‚Äôs worldwide sales of
agriculture and turf equipment are forecast to increase about
3 percent for fiscal year 2019, including a negative currency
translation effect of 2 percent. Industry sales of agricultural
equipment in the U.S. and Canada are forecast to be about
the same to 5 percent higher, helped by replacement demand
for large equipment and continued demand for small tractors.
Full year industry sales in the EU28 member nations are
forecast to be about the same as a result of drought
conditions in key markets. South American industry sales of
tractors and combines are projected to be about the same to
5 percent higher benefiting from strength in Brazil. Asian sales
are forecast to be about the same to down slightly. Industry
sales of turf and utility equipment in the U.S. and Canada are
expected to be about the same to 5 percent higher for 2019.
Construction and Forestry. The company‚Äôs worldwide sales of
construction and forestry equipment are anticipated to
increase about 15 percent for 2019, with foreign currency rates
having an unfavorable translation effect of 2 percent. The
forecast includes a full year of Wirtgen sales, versus
10 months in fiscal 2018, with the two additional months
adding about 5 percent to division sales for the year. The
outlook reflects continued growth in U.S. housing demand as
well as transportation investment and economic growth
worldwide. In forestry, global industry sales are expected to
increase about 10 percent mainly as a result of improved
demand throughout the world, led by the U.S.
Financial Services. Fiscal year 2019 net income attributable to
Deere & Company for the financial services operations is
expected to be approximately $630 million. Excluding the
2018 benefit from tax reform, net income is expected to
benefit from a higher average portfolio, partially offset by
higher selling and administrative expenses, a higher provision
for credit losses, and less favorable financing spreads.
SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT
Safe Harbor Statement under the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995: Statements under ‚Äò‚ÄòOverview,‚Äô‚Äô ‚Äò‚ÄòMarket
Conditions and Outlook,‚Äô‚Äô and other forward-looking
statements herein that relate to future events, expectations,
and trends involve factors that are subject to change, and
risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ
materially. Some of these risks and uncertainties could affect
particular lines of business, while others could affect all of the
company‚Äôs businesses.
The company‚Äôs agricultural equipment business is subject to a
number of uncertainties including the factors that affect

farmers‚Äô confidence and financial condition. These factors
include demand for agricultural products, world grain stocks,
weather conditions, soil conditions, harvest yields, prices for
commodities and livestock, crop and livestock production
expenses, availability of transport for crops, trade restrictions
and tariffs, global trade agreements (e.g, the North American
Free Trade Agreement), the level of farm product exports
(including concerns about genetically modified organisms), the
growth and sustainability of non-food uses for some crops
(including ethanol and biodiesel production), real estate values,
available acreage for farming, the land ownership policies of
governments, changes in government farm programs and
policies, international reaction to such programs, changes in
and effects of crop insurance programs, changes in
environmental regulations and their impact on farming
practices, animal diseases and their effects on poultry, beef
and pork consumption and prices, and crop pests and
diseases.
Factors affecting the outlook for the company‚Äôs turf and
utility equipment include consumer confidence, weather
conditions, customer profitability, labor supply, consumer
borrowing patterns, consumer purchasing preferences, housing
starts and supply, infrastructure investment, spending by
municipalities and golf courses, and consumable input costs.
Consumer spending patterns, real estate and housing prices,
the number of housing starts, interest rates and the levels of
public and non-residential construction are important to sales
and results of the company‚Äôs construction and forestry
equipment. Prices for pulp, paper, lumber and structural panels
are important to sales of forestry equipment.
All of the company‚Äôs businesses and its results are affected by
general economic conditions in the global markets and
industries in which the company operates; customer
confidence in general economic conditions; government
spending and taxing; foreign currency exchange rates and
their volatility, especially fluctuations in the value of the U.S.
dollar; interest rates; inflation and deflation rates; changes in
weather patterns; the political and social stability of the global
markets in which the company operates; the effects of, or
response to, terrorism and security threats; wars and other
conflicts; natural disasters; and the spread of major epidemics.
Significant changes in market liquidity conditions, changes in
the company‚Äôs credit ratings and any failure to comply with
financial covenants in credit agreements could impact access
to funding and funding costs, which could reduce the
company‚Äôs earnings and cash flows. Financial market
conditions could also negatively impact customer access to
capital for purchases of the company‚Äôs products and customer
confidence and purchase decisions, borrowing and repayment
practices, and the number and size of customer loan
delinquencies and defaults. A debt crisis, in Europe or
elsewhere, could negatively impact currencies, global financial
markets, social and political stability, funding sources and
costs, asset and obligation values, customers, suppliers,
demand for equipment, and company operations and results.
The company‚Äôs investment management activities could be
impaired by changes in the equity, bond and other financial
markets, which would negatively affect earnings.
The anticipated withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the
European Union and the perceptions as to the impact of the

25

25

withdrawal may adversely affect business activity, political
stability and economic conditions in the United Kingdom, the
European Union and elsewhere. The economic conditions and
outlook could be further adversely affected by (i) the
uncertainty concerning the timing and terms of the exit,
(ii) new or modified trading arrangements between the United
Kingdom and other countries, (iii) the risk that one or more
other European Union countries could come under increasing
pressure to leave the European Union, or (iv) the risk that the
euro as the single currency of the Eurozone could cease to
exist. Any of these developments, or the perception that any
of these developments are likely to occur, could affect
economic growth or business activity in the United Kingdom
or the European Union, and could result in the relocation of
businesses, cause business interruptions, lead to economic
recession or depression, and impact the stability of the
financial markets, availability of credit, currency exchange
rates, interest rates, financial institutions, and political,
financial and monetary systems. Any of these developments
could affect our businesses, liquidity, results of operations and
financial position.
Additional factors that could materially affect the company‚Äôs
operations, access to capital, expenses and results include
changes in, uncertainty surrounding and the impact of
governmental trade, banking, monetary and fiscal policies,
including financial regulatory reform and its effects on the
consumer finance industry, derivatives, funding costs and
other areas, and governmental programs, policies, tariffs and
sanctions in particular jurisdictions or for the benefit of
certain industries or sectors; retaliatory actions to such
changes in trade, banking, monetary and fiscal policies;
actions by central banks; actions by financial and securities
regulators; actions by environmental, health and safety
regulatory agencies, including those related to engine
emissions, carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions, noise
and the effects of climate change; changes to GPS radio
frequency bands or their permitted uses; changes in labor and
immigration regulations; changes to accounting standards;
changes in tax rates, estimates, laws and regulations and
company actions related thereto; changes to and compliance
with privacy regulations; compliance with U.S. and foreign
laws when expanding to new markets and otherwise; and
actions by other regulatory bodies.
Other factors that could materially affect results include
production, design and technological innovations and
difficulties, including capacity and supply constraints and
prices; the loss of or challenges to intellectual property rights
whether through theft, infringement, counterfeiting or
otherwise; the availability and prices of strategically sourced
materials, components and whole goods; delays or disruptions
in the company‚Äôs supply chain or the loss of liquidity by
suppliers; disruptions of infrastructures that support
communications, operations or distribution; the failure of
suppliers or the company to comply with laws, regulations and
company policy pertaining to employment, human rights,
health, safety, the environment, anti-corruption, privacy and
data protection and other ethical business practices; events

The liquidity and ongoing profitability of John Deere Capital
Corporation and other credit subsidiaries depend largely on
timely access to capital in order to meet future cash flow
requirements, and to fund operations, costs, and purchases of
the company‚Äôs products. If general economic conditions
deteriorate or capital markets become more volatile, funding
could be unavailable or insufficient. Additionally, customer
confidence levels may result in declines in credit applications
and increases in delinquencies and default rates, which could
materially impact write-offs and provisions for credit losses.
The company‚Äôs outlook is based upon assumptions relating to
the factors described above, which are sometimes based upon
estimates and data prepared by government agencies. Such
estimates and data are often revised. The company, except as
required by law, undertakes no obligation to update or revise
its outlook, whether as a result of new developments or
otherwise. Further information concerning the company and
its businesses, including factors that could materially affect
the company‚Äôs financial results, is included in the company‚Äôs
other filings with the SEC.
2017 COMPARED WITH 2016
CONSOLIDATED RESULTS
Worldwide net income attributable to Deere & Company in
2017 was $2,159 million, or $6.68 per share diluted ($6.76
basic), compared with $1,524 million, or $4.81 per share
diluted ($4.83 basic), in 2016. Worldwide net sales and
revenues increased 12 percent to $29,738 million in 2017,
compared with $26,644 million in 2016. Net sales of the
worldwide equipment operations rose 11 percent in 2017 to
$25,885 million from $23,387 million in 2016. Sales included
price realization of 1 percent and a favorable currency
translation effect of 1 percent. Equipment net sales in the

26

United States and Canada increased 5 percent for 2017.
Outside the U.S. and Canada, net sales increased 20 percent
for the year, with a favorable currency translation effect of
1 percent for 2017.
Worldwide equipment operations had an operating profit of
$2,859 million in 2017, compared with $1,908 million in 2016.
The operating profit increase was primarily due to higher
shipment volumes, a gain on the sale of the remaining
interest in SiteOne (see Note 5), price realization, and a
favorable product mix, partially offset by increases in
production costs, selling, administrative and general expenses,
and warranty related expenses.
Net income of the company‚Äôs equipment operations was
$1,707 million for 2017, compared with $1,058 million in 2016.
The operating factors mentioned above affected the results.
The financial services operations reported net income
attributable to Deere & Company in 2017 of $477 million,
compared with $468 million in 2016. The increase was largely
due to lower losses on lease residual values, partially offset by
less favorable financing spreads and higher selling,
administrative and general expenses. Additional information is
presented in the following discussion of the ‚Äò‚ÄòWorldwide
Financial Services Operations.‚Äô‚Äô
The cost of sales to net sales ratio for 2017 was 76.7 percent,
compared with 77.8 percent in 2016. The improvement was
due primarily to price realization and a favorable product mix,
partially offset by increases in production costs and warranty
related expenses.
Finance and interest income increased in 2017 due to a larger
average credit portfolio and higher average interest rates.
Other income increased due primarily to the gain on the sale
of the remaining interest in SiteOne (see Note 5). Selling,
administrative and general expenses increased due primarily to
higher incentive compensation expense, higher commissions
paid to dealers on direct sales, and expenses related to
voluntary employee-separation programs. Interest expense
increased due to higher average borrowing rates and higher
average borrowings. Other operating expenses increased
primarily due to higher depreciation of equipment on
operating leases, partially offset by lower losses on lease
residual values.
The company has several defined benefit pension plans and
OPEB plans. The company‚Äôs costs for these plans in 2017 were
$347 million, compared with $312 million in 2016. The
long-term expected return on plan assets, which is reflected
in these costs, was an expected gain of 7.2 percent in 2017
and 7.3 percent in 2016, or $807 million in 2017 and
$810 million in 2016. The actual return was a gain of
$1,563 million in 2017 and $645 million in 2016. Total company
contributions to the plans were $428 million in 2017 and
$127 million in 2016, which include direct benefit payments for
unfunded plans and voluntary contributions to plan assets of
$301 million in 2017 and $3 million in 2016.
BUSINESS SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA RESULTS
Worldwide Agriculture and Turf Operations
The agriculture and turf segment had an operating profit of
$2,513 million for the year, compared with $1,719 million in

2016. Net sales increased 9 percent in 2017 due to higher
shipment volumes, price realization, and the favorable effects
of currency translation. Operating profit was higher due
primarily to increased shipment volumes, a gain on the sale of
the remaining interest in SiteOne (see Note 5), price
realization, and a favorable sales mix, partially offset by
increases in production costs, selling, administrative and
general expenses, and warranty related expenses.
Worldwide Construction and Forestry Operations
The construction and forestry segment had an operating profit
of $346 million in 2017, compared with $189 million in 2016.
Net sales increased 17 percent for the year on account of
higher shipment volumes, price realization, and the favorable
effects of currency translation. Operating profit increased
mainly attributable to improved shipment volumes and price
realization, partially offset by higher warranty expenses,
increased selling, administrative and general expenses, and
higher production costs.
Worldwide Financial Services Operations
The operating profit of the financial services segment was
$715 million in 2017, compared with $701 million in 2016. The
increase was largely due to lower losses on lease residual
values, partially offset by less favorable financing spreads and
higher selling, administrative and general expenses. Total
revenues of the financial services operations, including
intercompany revenues, increased 9 percent in 2017. The
average balance of receivables and leases financed was
1 percent higher in 2017, compared with 2016. Interest
expense increased 25 percent in 2017 as a result of higher
average borrowing rates. The financial services operations‚Äô
ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 2.12 to 1 in 2017,
compared with 2.35 to 1 in 2016.
Equipment Operations in U.S. and Canada
The equipment operations in the U.S. and Canada had an
operating profit of $1,754 million in 2017, compared with
$1,328 million in 2016. The increase was due primarily to
higher shipment volumes, a gain on the sale of the remaining
interest in SiteOne (see Note 5), a favorable sales mix, and
price realization, partially offset by increases in production
costs, selling, administrative and general expenses, and
warranty related expenses. Net sales increased 5 percent due
primarily to higher shipment volumes. The physical volume of
sales increased 5 percent, compared with 2016.
Equipment Operations outside U.S. and Canada
The equipment operations outside the U.S. and Canada had an
operating profit of $1,105 million in 2017, compared with
$580 million in 2016. The increase was due primarily to higher
shipment volumes and price realization, partially offset by
higher production costs and increased selling, administrative
and general expenses. Net sales increased 20 percent in 2017
compared to 2016. The increase was primarily the result of
higher shipment volumes, price realization, and the favorable
effects of foreign currency translation. The physical volume of
sales increased 16 percent, compared with 2016.

global funding and liquidity to meet its funding needs.
Sources of liquidity for the company include cash and cash
equivalents, marketable securities, funds from operations, the
issuance of commercial paper and term debt, the securitization
of retail notes (both public and private markets), and
committed and uncommitted bank lines of credit. The
company‚Äôs commercial paper outstanding at October 28, 2018
and October 29, 2017 was $3,857 million and $3,439 million,
respectively, while the total cash and cash equivalents and
marketable securities position was $4,394 million and
$9,787 million, respectively. The amount of the total cash and
cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign
subsidiaries was $2,433 million and $3,386 million at
October 28, 2018 and October 29, 2017, respectively.
Lines of Credit. The company also has access to bank lines of
credit with various banks throughout the world. Worldwide
lines of credit totaled $8,389 million at October 28, 2018,
$3,724 million of which were unused. For the purpose of
computing unused credit lines, commercial paper and
short-term bank borrowings, excluding secured borrowings
and the current portion of long-term borrowings, were
primarily considered to constitute utilization. Included in the
total credit lines at October 28, 2018 were 364-day credit
facility agreements of $1,750 million, expiring in April 2019,
and $750 million, expiring in October 2019. In addition, total
credit lines included long-term credit facility agreements of
$2,500 million, expiring in April 2021, and $2,500 million,
expiring in April 2022. These credit agreements require John
Deere Capital Corporation (Capital Corporation) to maintain its
consolidated ratio of earnings to fixed charges at not less
than 1.05 to 1 for each fiscal quarter and the ratio of senior
debt, excluding securitization indebtedness, to capital base
(total subordinated debt and stockholder‚Äôs equity excluding
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)) at not more
than 11 to 1 at the end of any fiscal quarter. The credit
agreements also require the equipment operations to maintain
a ratio of total debt to total capital (total debt and
stockholders‚Äô equity excluding accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss)) of 65 percent or less at the end
of each fiscal quarter. Under this provision, the company‚Äôs
excess equity capacity and retained earnings balance free of
restriction at October 28, 2018 was $12,368 million.
Alternatively under this provision, the equipment operations
had the capacity to incur additional debt of $22,969 million
at October 28, 2018. All of these requirements of the credit
agreements have been met during the periods included in the
consolidated financial statements.
Debt Ratings. To access public debt capital markets, the
company relies on credit rating agencies to assign short-term
and long-term credit ratings to the company‚Äôs securities as an
indicator of credit quality for fixed income investors. A
security rating is not a recommendation by the rating agency
to buy, sell, or hold company securities. A credit rating agency
may change or withdraw company ratings based on its
assessment of the company‚Äôs current and future ability to
meet interest and principal repayment obligations. Each
agency‚Äôs rating should be evaluated independently of any
other rating. Lower credit ratings generally result in higher
borrowing costs, including costs of derivative transactions, and
reduced access to debt capital markets.

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY
The discussion of capital resources and liquidity has been
organized to review separately, where appropriate, the
company‚Äôs consolidated totals, equipment operations, and
financial services operations.
CONSOLIDATED
Positive cash flows from consolidated operating activities in
2018 were $1,820 million. This resulted primarily from net
income adjusted for non-cash provisions and an increase in
accounts payable and accrued expenses, which were partially
offset by an increase in inventories, an increase in receivables
related to sales, a change in net retirement benefits (see
Note 7), and a change in accrued income taxes payable/
receivable. Cash outflows from investing activities were
$8,154 million in 2018, due primarily to acquisitions of
businesses, net of cash acquired, of $5,245 million (see
Note 4), the cost of receivables (excluding receivables related
to sales) and cost of equipment on operating leases acquired
exceeding the collections of receivables and the proceeds from
sales of equipment on operating leases by $1,995 million,
purchases of property and equipment of $896 million, and
purchases of marketable securities exceeding proceeds from
maturities and sales by $56 million, partially offset by
proceeds from sales of businesses and unconsolidated
affiliates, net of cash sold, of $156 million (see Note 4). Cash
inflows from financing activities were $876 million in 2018,
due primarily to an increase in borrowings of $2,516 million
and proceeds from issuance of common stock (resulting from
the exercise of stock options) of $217 million, partially offset
by repurchases of common stock of $958 million and
dividends paid of $806 million. Cash and cash equivalents
decreased $5,431 million during 2018. The decrease in cash
primarily related to the Wirtgen acquisition (see Note 4).
In 2018, the company made voluntary contributions of
$1,000 million to the U.S. pension and OPEB plans that
resulted in a tax deduction applicable to the 2017 tax year.
The company also made a voluntary contribution of
$300 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 to its U.S. OPEB
plans that resulted in a tax deduction in the 2018 tax year.
Over the last three years, operating activities have provided an
aggregate of $7,790 million in cash. In addition, increases in
borrowings were $5,721 million, proceeds from issuance of
common stock (resulting from the exercise of stock options)
were $782 million, proceeds from sales of businesses and
unconsolidated affiliates were $351 million, and proceeds from
maturities and sales exceeded purchases of marketable
securities by $228 million. The aggregate amount of these
cash flows was used mainly to acquire businesses of
$5,728 million, acquire receivables (excluding receivables
related to sales) and equipment on operating leases that
exceeded collections of receivables and the proceeds from
sales of equipment on operating leases by $3,500 million, pay
dividends of $2,331 million, purchase property and equipment
of $2,136 million, and repurchase common stock of
$1,170 million. Cash and cash equivalents decreased
$258 million over the three-year period.
The company has access to most global capital markets at
reasonable costs and expects to have sufficient sources of

(LIFO) method. The ratios of inventories on a first-in, first-out
(FIFO) basis (see Note 15), which approximates current cost, to
fiscal year cost of sales were 30 percent and 27 percent at
October 28, 2018 and October 29, 2017, respectively.
Total interest-bearing debt of the equipment operations was
$6,224 million at the end of 2018, compared with
$5,866 million at the end of 2017 and $4,814 million at the
end of 2016. The ratio of total debt to total capital (total
interest-bearing debt and stockholders‚Äô equity) at the end of
2018, 2017, and 2016 was 36 percent, 38 percent, and
42 percent, respectively.
Property and equipment cash expenditures for the equipment
operations in 2018 were $893 million, compared with
$591 million in 2017. Capital expenditures in 2019 are
estimated to be $1,150 million.
In December 2017, the company acquired Wirtgen for a cash
purchase price of $5,136 million, excluding cash acquired. The
acquisition and transaction expenses were financed from a
combination of cash and new debt financing, which consisted
of medium-term notes, including e850 million issued in
September 2017 (see Note 4).
FINANCIAL SERVICES
The financial services operations rely on their ability to raise
substantial amounts of funds to finance their receivable and
lease portfolios. Their primary sources of funds for this
purpose are a combination of commercial paper, term debt,
securitization of retail notes, equity capital, and borrowings
from Deere & Company.
The cash provided by operating and financing activities was
used for investing activities. Cash flows from the financial
services‚Äô operating activities, including intercompany cash
flows, were $1,643 million in 2018. Cash used by investing
activities totaled $4,839 million in 2018 due primarily to the
cost of receivables (excluding trade and wholesale) and cost of
equipment on operating leases acquired exceeding collections
of these receivables and the proceeds from sales of equipment
on operating leases by $3,472 million, an increase in trade
receivables and wholesale notes of $1,222 million, and
purchases of marketable securities exceeding proceeds from
maturities and sales by $68 million. Cash provided by
financing activities totaled $2,767 million in 2018, representing
primarily an increase in external borrowings of $2,515 million
and an increase in borrowings from Deere & Company of
$748 million, partially offset by dividends paid to Deere &
Company of $464 million. Cash and cash equivalents
decreased $457 million.
Over the last three years, the operating activities, including
intercompany cash flows, have provided $5,380 million in
cash. In addition, an increase in total borrowings of
$4,083 million and a capital investment from Deere &
Company of $49 million provided cash inflows. These amounts
have been used mainly to fund receivables (excluding trade
and wholesale) and equipment on operating lease acquisitions,
which exceeded collections and the proceeds from sales of
equipment on operating leases, by $7,264 million, pay
dividends to Deere & Company of $1,391 million, fund an
increase in trade receivables and wholesale notes of
$1,110 million, and purchase $104 million of marketable
securities in excess of maturities and sales. Cash and cash
equivalents decreased $553 million over the three-year period.

Trade accounts and notes receivable primarily arise from sales
of goods to independent dealers. Trade receivables increased
by $1,079 million in 2018 due primarily to higher shipment
volumes and the Wirtgen acquisition. The ratio of trade
accounts and notes receivable at October 28, 2018 and
October 29, 2017 to fiscal year net sales was 15 percent in
both 2018 and 2017. Total worldwide agriculture and turf
receivables increased $219 million and construction and
forestry receivables increased $860 million. The collection
period for trade receivables averages less than 12 months. The
percentage of trade receivables outstanding for a period
exceeding 12 months was 2 percent at October 28, 2018 and
1 percent at October 29, 2017.
Deere & Company‚Äôs stockholders‚Äô equity was $11,288 million at
October 28, 2018, compared with $9,557 million at October 29,
2017. The increase of $1,731 million resulted from net income
attributable to Deere & Company of $2,368 million, a change in
the retirement benefits adjustment of $1,052 million, and an
increase in common stock of $194 million, which were partially
offset by an increase in treasury stock of $851 million,
dividends declared of $834 million, and a change in the
cumulative translation adjustment of $195 million.
EQUIPMENT OPERATIONS
The company‚Äôs equipment businesses are capital intensive and
are subject to seasonal variations in financing requirements for
inventories and certain receivables from dealers. The
equipment operations sell a significant portion of their trade
receivables to financial services. To the extent necessary,
funds provided from operations are supplemented by external
financing sources.
Cash provided by operating activities of the equipment
operations during 2018, including intercompany cash flows,
was $3,279 million due primarily to net income adjusted for
non-cash provisions, an increase in accounts payable and
accrued expenses, and a change in accrued income taxes
payable/receivable, partially offset by a change in net
retirement benefits (see Note 7), an increase in inventories,
and an increase in trade receivables and Equipment
Operations‚Äô financing receivables.
Over the last three years, these operating activities, including
intercompany cash flows, have provided an aggregate of
$8,629 million in cash.
Trade receivables held by the equipment operations increased
by $497 million during 2018. The equipment operations sell a
significant portion of their trade receivables to financial
services (see previous consolidated discussion).
Inventories increased by $2,245 million in 2018 due primarily
to the Wirtgen acquisition and higher production volumes,
partially offset by the effect of foreign currency translation.
Most of these inventories are valued on the last-in, first-out

Receivables and equipment on operating leases increased by
$2,987 million in 2018, compared with 2017. Total acquisition
volumes of receivables (excluding trade and wholesale notes)
and cost of equipment on operating leases increased
11 percent in 2018, compared with 2017. The volumes of
financing leases, retail notes, revolving charge accounts, and
operating leases increased approximately 29 percent,
14 percent, 4 percent, and 4 percent, respectively. During
2018, the amount of trade receivables and wholesale notes
increased 17 percent and 12 percent, respectively. At
October 28, 2018 and October 29, 2017, net receivables and
leases administered, which include receivables administered but
not owned, were $42,985 million and $40,001 million,
respectively.
Total external interest-bearing debt of the financial services
operations was $36,033 million at the end of 2018, compared
with $34,179 million at the end of 2017 and $30,797 million at
the end of 2016. Total external borrowings have changed
generally corresponding with the level of the receivable and
lease portfolio, the level of cash and cash equivalents, the
change in payables owed to Deere & Company, and the
change in investment from Deere & Company. The financial
services operations‚Äô ratio of total interest-bearing debt to total
stockholder‚Äôs equity was 7.5 to 1 at the end of 2018, and 7.6
to 1 at the end of 2017 and 2016.
The Capital Corporation has a revolving credit agreement to
utilize bank conduit facilities to securitize retail notes (see
Note 13). At October 28, 2018, the facility had a total capacity,
or ‚Äò‚Äòfinancing limit,‚Äô‚Äô of up to $3,500 million of secured
financings at any time. The facility was renewed in November
2018 with a capacity of $3,500 million. After a two-year
revolving period, unless the banks and Capital Corporation
agree to renew, Capital Corporation would liquidate the
secured borrowings over time as payments on the retail notes
are collected. At October 28, 2018, $1,364 million of
short-term securitization borrowings was outstanding under
the agreement.
During 2018, the financial services operations issued
$2,601 million and retired $2,838 million of retail note
securitization borrowings. During 2018, the financial services
operations also issued $8,139 million and retired
$6,082 million of long-term borrowings, which were primarily
medium-term notes.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The preparation of the company‚Äôs consolidated financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Changes in these estimates
and assumptions could have a significant effect on the
financial statements. The accounting policies below are those
management believes are the most critical to the preparation
of the company‚Äôs financial statements and require the most
difficult, subjective, or complex judgments. The company‚Äôs
other accounting policies are described in the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.
Sales Incentives
At the time a sale to a dealer is recognized, the company
records an estimate of the future sales incentive costs for
allowances and financing programs that will be due when the
dealer sells the equipment to a retail customer. The estimate
is based on historical data, announced incentive programs,
field inventory levels, and retail sales volumes. The final cost
of these programs and the amount of accrual required for a
specific sale are fully determined when the dealer sells the
equipment to the retail customer. This is due to numerous
programs available at any particular time and new programs

At October 28, 2018, the company had approximately
$357 million of guarantees issued primarily to banks outside
the U.S. and Canada related to third-party receivables for the
retail financing of John Deere and Wirtgen equipment. The
increase from October 29, 2017 primarily relates to the
Wirtgen acquisition. The company may recover a portion of
any required payments incurred under these agreements from
repossession of the equipment collateralizing the receivables.
The maximum remaining term of the receivables guaranteed at
October 28, 2018 was approximately seven years.

30

Less
than
1 year

that may be announced after the company records the sale.
Changes in the mix and types of programs affect these
estimates, which are reviewed quarterly.
The sales incentive accruals at October 28, 2018, October 29,
2017, and October 30, 2016 were $1,850 million,
$1,581 million, and $1,391 million, respectively. The increases in
2018 and 2017 were related primarily to higher sales volumes.
The estimation of the sales incentive accrual is impacted by
many assumptions. One of the key assumptions is the
historical percent of sales incentive costs to retail sales from
dealers. Over the last five fiscal years, this percent has varied
by an average of approximately plus or minus 1.1 percent,
compared to the average sales incentive costs to retail sales
percent during that period. Holding other assumptions
constant, if this estimated cost experience percent were to
increase or decrease 1.1 percent, the sales incentive accrual at
October 28, 2018 would increase or decrease by approximately
$90 million.
Product Warranties
At the time a sale is recognized, the company records the
estimated future warranty costs. The company generally
determines its total warranty liability by applying historical
claims rate experience to the estimated amount of equipment
that has been sold and is still under warranty based on dealer
inventories and retail sales. The historical claims rate is
primarily determined by a review of five-year claims costs and
consideration of current quality developments. Variances in
claims experience and the type of warranty programs affect
these estimates, which are reviewed quarterly.
The product warranty accruals, excluding extended warranty
unamortized premiums, at October 28, 2018, October 29,
2017, and October 30, 2016 were $1,146 million,
$1,007 million, and $779 million, respectively. The increases in
2018 and 2017 were due primarily to higher sales volumes.
Estimates used to determine the product warranty accruals are
significantly affected by the historical percent of warranty
claims costs to sales. Over the last five fiscal years, this
percent has varied by an average of approximately plus or
minus .13 percent, compared to the average warranty costs to
sales percent during that period. Holding other assumptions
constant, if this estimated cost experience percent were to
increase or decrease .13 percent, the warranty accrual at
October 28, 2018 would increase or decrease by approximately
$50 million.
Postretirement Benefit Obligations
Pension and other postretirement benefit (OPEB), primarily
health care and life insurance plans, obligations are based on
various assumptions used by the company‚Äôs actuaries in
calculating these amounts. These assumptions include discount
rates, health care cost trend rates, expected return on plan
assets, compensation increases, retirement rates, mortality
rates, and other factors. Actual results that differ from the
assumptions and changes in assumptions affect future
expenses and obligations.
The pension assets, net of pension liabilities, recognized on
the balance sheet at October 28, 2018 were $494 million. The
pension liabilities, net of pension assets, recognized on the
balance sheet at October 29, 2017 and October 30, 2016 were
$1,073 million, and $1,949 million, respectively. The

increase in pension net assets in 2018 was due primarily to
increases in discount rates and contributions to a U.S. pension
plan (see Note 7), partially offset by interest on the liabilities.
The decrease in pension net liabilities in 2017 was due
primarily to the return on plan assets, partially offset by
interest on the liabilities and service cost. The OPEB liabilities,
net of OPEB assets, at October 28, 2018, October 29, 2017,
and October 30, 2016 were $4,753 million, $5,623 million, and
$6,065 million, respectively. The decrease in OPEB net
liabilities in 2018 was due primarily to increases in discount
rates and contributions to the U.S. OPEB plans (see Note 7).
The decrease in OPEB net liabilities in 2017 was due primarily
to a contribution to a U.S. OPEB plan.
The effect of hypothetical changes to selected assumptions on
the company‚Äôs major U.S. retirement benefit plans would be as

Goodwill
Goodwill is not amortized and is tested for impairment
annually and when events or circumstances change such that
it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting
unit is reduced below its carrying amount. The end of the
fiscal third quarter is the annual measurement date. To test
for goodwill impairment, the carrying value of each reporting
unit is compared with its fair value. If the carrying value of
the goodwill is considered impaired, a loss is measured as the
excess of the reporting unit‚Äôs carrying value over the fair
value, with a limit of the goodwill allocated to that reporting
unit.
An estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit is
determined through a combination of comparable market
values for similar businesses and discounted cash flows. These
estimates can change significantly based on such factors as
the reporting unit‚Äôs financial performance, economic
conditions, interest rates, growth rates, pricing, changes in
business strategies, and competition.
Based on this testing, the company has not identified a
reporting unit for which the goodwill was impaired in 2018,
2017, or 2016. For all reporting units, except for the recently
acquired Wirtgen reporting unit (see Note 4), a 10 percent
decrease in the estimated fair value would have had no effect
on the carrying value of goodwill at the annual measurement
date in 2018. The Wirtgen reporting unit exceeded acquisition
projections in 2018 and expects to meet future projections.

Allowance for Credit Losses
The allowance for credit losses represents an estimate of the
losses inherent in the company‚Äôs receivable portfolio. The level
of the allowance is based on many quantitative and qualitative
factors, including historical net loss experience by product
category, portfolio duration, delinquency trends, economic
conditions in the company‚Äôs major markets and geographies,
and credit risk quality. The company has an established
process to calculate a range of possible outcomes and
determine the adequacy of the allowance. The adequacy of
the allowance is assessed quarterly. Different assumptions or
changes in economic conditions would result in changes to
the allowance for credit losses and the provision for credit
losses.
The total allowance for credit losses at October 28, 2018,
October 29, 2017, and October 30, 2016 was $248 million,
$243 million, and $226 million, respectively. The allowance
increases in 2018 and 2017 were due primarily to growth in
the receivable portfolio.
The assumptions used in evaluating the company‚Äôs exposure
to credit losses involve estimates and significant judgment.
The historical loss experience on the receivable portfolio
represents one factor used in determining the allowance for
credit losses. Compared to the average loss experience over
the last five fiscal years, this percent has varied by an average
of approximately plus or minus .06 percent, compared to the
average loss experience percent during that period. Holding
other factors constant, if this estimated loss experience on the
receivable portfolio were to increase or decrease .06 percent,
the allowance for credit losses at October 28, 2018 would
increase or decrease by approximately $21 million.
Operating Lease Residual Values
The carrying value of equipment on operating leases is
affected by the estimated fair values of the equipment at the
end of the lease (residual values). Upon termination of the
lease, the equipment is either purchased by the lessee or sold
to a third party, in which case the company may record a gain
or a loss for the difference between the estimated residual
value and the sale price. The residual values are dependent on
current economic conditions and are reviewed when events or
circumstances necessitate an evaluation. Changes in residual
value assumptions would affect the amount of depreciation
expense and the amount of investment in equipment on
operating leases.
The total operating lease residual values at October 28, 2018,
October 29, 2017, and October 30, 2016 were $5,089 million,
$4,679 million, and $4,347 million, respectively. The changes
in 2018 and 2017 were due primarily to the increasing levels of
operating leases.
Estimates used in determining end of lease market values for
equipment on operating leases significantly impact the amount
and timing of depreciation expense. Hypothetically, if future
market values for this equipment were to decrease 10 percent
from the company‚Äôs present estimates, the total effect would
be to increase the company‚Äôs annual depreciation for
equipment on operating leases by approximately $185 million.

32

Income Taxes
The company‚Äôs income tax provision, deferred income tax
assets and liabilities, and liabilities for uncertain tax benefits
represent the company‚Äôs best estimate of current and future
income taxes to be paid. The annual tax rate is based on
income tax laws, statutory tax rates, taxable income levels,
and tax planning opportunities available in various jurisdictions
where the company operates. These tax laws are complex, and
require significant judgment to determine the consolidated
provision for income taxes. Changes in tax laws, regulations,
statutory tax rates, and estimates of the company‚Äôs future
taxable income levels could result in actual realization of
deferred taxes being materially different from amounts
provided for in the consolidated financial statements.
Deferred income taxes represent temporary differences
between the tax and the financial reporting basis of assets
and liabilities, which will result in taxable or deductible
amounts in the future. Deferred tax assets also include loss
carryforwards and tax credits. These assets are regularly
assessed for the likelihood of recoverability from estimated
future taxable income, reversal of deferred tax liabilities, and
tax planning strategies. To the extent the company determines
that it is more likely than not a deferred income tax asset will
not be realized, a valuation allowance is established. The
recoverability analysis of the deferred income tax assets and
the related valuation allowances requires significant judgment
and relies on estimates.
Uncertain tax positions are determined based on whether it is
more likely than not the tax positions will be sustained based
on the technical merits of the position. For those positions
that meet the more likely than not criteria, an estimate of the
largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent
likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related
tax authority is recognized. The ultimate resolution of the tax
position could take many years and result in a payment that is
significantly different from the original estimate.
Tax reform included additional requirements effective for the
company in 2019. Those provisions include a tax on global
intangible low-taxed income (GILTI), a tax determined by base
erosion and anti-abuse tax benefits (BEAT) from certain
payments between a U.S. corporation and foreign subsidiaries,
a limitation of certain executive compensation, a deduction for
foreign derived intangible income (FDII), and interest expense
limitations. These new provisions require interpretation and
will use estimates to determine the liability and benefits. The
company‚Äôs accounting policy election is to treat the taxes due
on future U.S. inclusions in taxable income under GILTI as a
period cost when incurred.
A provision for foreign withholding taxes has not been
recorded on undistributed profits of the company‚Äôs non-U.S.
subsidiaries that are determined to be indefinitely reinvested
outside the U.S. If management intentions change in the
future, there may be a significant impact on the provision for
income taxes in the period the change occurs. For further
information on income taxes, see Note 8 to the consolidated
financial statements.

market credit spreads for similarly rated borrowers, cash flows
for securitized borrowings are discounted at the swap yield
curve plus a market credit spread for similarly rated borrowers,
and cash flows for interest rate swaps are projected and
discounted using forward rates from the swap yield curve at
the repricing dates. The net loss in these financial
instruments‚Äô fair values which would be caused by decreasing
the interest rates by 10 percent from the market rates at
October 28, 2018 would have been approximately $21 million.
The net loss from increasing the interest rates by 10 percent
at October 29, 2017 would have been approximately
$4 million.
Foreign Currency Risk
In the equipment operations, the company‚Äôs practice is to
hedge significant currency exposures. Worldwide foreign
currency exposures are reviewed quarterly. Based on the
equipment operations‚Äô anticipated and committed foreign
currency cash inflows, outflows, and hedging policy for the
next twelve months, the company estimates that a
hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar
relative to other currencies through 2019 would decrease the
2019 expected net cash inflows by approximately $55 million.
At October 29, 2017, a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening
of the U.S. dollar under similar assumptions and calculations
indicated a potential $78 million adverse effect on the 2018
net cash inflows.
In the financial services operations, the company‚Äôs policy is to
hedge the foreign currency risk if the currency of the
borrowings does not match the currency of the receivable
portfolio. As a result, a hypothetical 10 percent adverse
change in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to all other
foreign currencies would not have a material effect on the
financial services cash flows.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT MARKET RISK INFORMATION
The company is naturally exposed to various interest rate and
foreign currency risks. As a result, the company enters into
derivative transactions to manage certain of these exposures
that arise in the normal course of business and not for the
purpose of creating speculative positions or trading. The
company‚Äôs financial services operations manage the
relationship of the types and amounts of their funding
sources to their receivable and lease portfolio in an effort to
diminish risk due to interest rate and foreign currency
fluctuations while responding to favorable financing
opportunities. In addition, the company has interest rate
exposure at certain equipment operations units for below
market retail financing programs that are used as sales
incentives and are offered for extended periods. Accordingly,
from time to time, these operations enter into interest rate
swap agreements to manage their interest rate exposure. The
company also has foreign currency exposures at some of its
foreign and domestic operations related to buying, selling, and
financing in currencies other than the functional currencies.
The company has entered into agreements related to the
management of these foreign currency transaction risks.
Interest Rate Risk
Quarterly, the company uses a combination of cash flow
models to assess the sensitivity of its financial instruments
with interest rate exposure to changes in market interest
rates. The models calculate the effect of adjusting interest
rates as follows: cash flows for financing receivables are
discounted at the current prevailing rate for each receivable
portfolio, cash flows for marketable securities are primarily
discounted at the applicable benchmark yield curve plus
market credit spreads, cash flows for unsecured borrowings
are discounted at the applicable benchmark yield curve plus

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT
REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

MANAGEMENT‚ÄôS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER
FINANCIAL REPORTING

To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Deere &
Company:
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets
of Deere & Company and subsidiaries (the ‚Äò‚ÄòCompany‚Äô‚Äô) as of
October 28, 2018 and October 29, 2017, the related statements
of consolidated income, consolidated comprehensive income,
changes in consolidated stockholders‚Äô equity, and consolidated
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
October 28, 2018, and the related notes (collectively referred to
as the ‚Äò‚Äòfinancial statements‚Äô‚Äô). In our opinion, the financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the Company as of October 28, 2018, and
October 29, 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended
October 28, 2018, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
(PCAOB), the Company‚Äôs internal control over financial reporting
as of October 28, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal
Control ‚Äì Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and
our report dated December 17, 2018, expressed an unqualified
opinion on the Company‚Äôs internal control over financial
reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company‚Äôs management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on the Company‚Äôs financial statements based on our
audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the
PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the
Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and
the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of
the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether
due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures
to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial
statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing
procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included
examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included
evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP

December 17, 2018
We have served as the Company‚Äôs auditor since 1910.

The management of Deere & Company (the ‚Äò‚Äòcompany‚Äô‚Äô) is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting. The company‚Äôs internal control
system was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the preparation and fair presentation of published financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles.
All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have
inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to
be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect
to financial statement preparation and presentation in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles.
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission guidance allows
companies to exclude acquisitions from management‚Äôs report on
internal control over financial reporting for the first year after
the acquisition when it is not possible to conduct an assessment.
In December 2017, the company acquired the stock and certain
assets of substantially all of the business of Wirtgen Group
Holding GmbH (Wirtgen) (see Note 4). Due to Wirtgen‚Äôs global
operations, management has excluded Wirtgen from the annual
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting as of October 28, 2018. Wirtgen represents 9 percent
of both the consolidated total assets and consolidated net sales
and revenues of Deere & Company as of and for the year ended
October 28, 2018.
Management assessed the effectiveness of the company‚Äôs
internal control over financial reporting as of October 28, 2018,
using the criteria set forth in Internal Control‚ÄîIntegrated
Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that
assessment, management believes that, as of October 28, 2018,
the company‚Äôs internal control over financial reporting was
effective.
The company‚Äôs independent registered public accounting firm has
issued an audit report on the effectiveness of the company‚Äôs
internal control over financial reporting. This report appears
below.
December 17, 2018

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that
a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed
risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial
Reporting
A company‚Äôs internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company‚Äôs internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of
the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company‚Äôs
assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT
REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Deere &
Company:
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of
Deere & Company and subsidiaries (the ‚Äò‚ÄòCompany‚Äô‚Äô) as of
October 28, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal
Control‚ÄîIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In
our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of
October 28, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal
Control‚ÄîIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
(PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the
year ended October 28, 2018, of the Company and our report
dated December 17, 2018, expressed an unqualified opinion on
those financial statements.
As described in Management‚Äôs Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment
the internal control over financial reporting at the acquired
entities and assets of Wirtgen Group Holding GmbH (‚Äò‚ÄòWirtgen‚Äô‚Äô),
which was acquired in December 2017 and whose financial
statements constitute 9 percent of both total assets and net
sales and revenues of the consolidated financial statement
amounts as of and for the year ended October 28, 2018.
Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over
financial reporting at Wirtgen.
Basis for Opinion
The Company‚Äôs management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting, included in the accompanying Management‚Äôs Report
on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on the Company‚Äôs internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public
accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to
be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with
the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
PCAOB.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. ORGANIZATION AND CONSOLIDATION

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Structure of Operations
The information in the notes and related commentary are
presented in a format that includes data grouped as follows:
Equipment Operations ‚Äì Includes the company‚Äôs agriculture
and turf operations and construction and forestry operations
with financial services reflected on the equity basis.
Financial Services ‚Äì Includes primarily the company‚Äôs financing
operations.
Consolidated ‚Äì Represents the consolidation of the equipment
operations and financial services. References to ‚Äò‚ÄòDeere &
Company‚Äô‚Äô or ‚Äò‚Äòthe company‚Äô‚Äô refer to the entire enterprise.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements represent primarily the
consolidation of all companies in which Deere & Company has
a controlling interest. Certain variable interest entities (VIEs)
are consolidated since the company is the primary beneficiary.
The primary beneficiary has both the power to direct the
activities that most significantly impact the VIEs‚Äô economic
performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right
to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the
VIEs. Deere & Company records its investment in each
unconsolidated affiliated company (generally 20 to 50 percent
ownership) at its related equity in the net assets of such
affiliate (see Note 10). Other investments (less than
20 percent ownership) are recorded at cost.
Fiscal Year
The company uses a 52/53 week fiscal year ending on the last
Sunday in the reporting period. The fiscal year ends for 2018,
2017, and 2016 were October 28, 2018, October 29, 2017, and
October 30, 2016, respectively. All fiscal years contained
52 weeks.
Variable Interest Entities
The company consolidates certain VIEs related to retail note
securitizations (see Note 13).
The company also has an interest in a joint venture that
manufactures construction equipment in Brazil for local and
overseas markets. The joint venture is a VIE, but the company
is not the primary beneficiary. Therefore, the entity‚Äôs financial
results are not fully consolidated in the company‚Äôs
consolidated financial statements, but are included on the
equity basis. The maximum exposure to losses at October 28,
2018 in millions of dollars follows:

The following are significant accounting policies in addition to
those included in other notes to the consolidated financial
statements.
Use of Estimates in Financial Statements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts and related disclosures. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.
Revenue Recognition
Sales of equipment and service parts are recorded when the
sales price is determinable and the risks and rewards of
ownership are transferred to independent parties based on the
sales agreements in effect. In the U.S. and most international
locations, this transfer occurs primarily when goods are
shipped. In Canada and some other international locations,
certain goods are shipped to dealers on a consignment basis
under which the risks and rewards of ownership are not
transferred to the dealer. Accordingly, in these locations, sales
are not recorded until a retail customer has purchased the
goods. In all cases, when a sale is recorded by the company,
no significant uncertainty exists surrounding the purchaser‚Äôs
obligation to pay. No right of return exists on sales of
equipment. In select instances, equipment is transferred to a
customer or a financial institution with a significant residual
value guarantee or with an obligation to repurchase the
equipment for a specified amount, which is exercisable at the
customer‚Äôs option. Those arrangements are accounted for as
leases. When the operating lease criteria are met, no sale is
recorded at the time of the equipment transfer and the
difference between sale price and the specified amount is
recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis until the
customer‚Äôs option expires. Service parts and certain
attachments returns are estimable and accrued at the time a
sale is recognized. The company makes appropriate provisions
based on experience for costs such as doubtful receivables,
sales incentives, and product warranty.
Financing revenue is recorded over the lives of related
receivables using the interest method. Extended warranty
premiums recorded in other income are generally recognized in
proportion to the costs expected to be incurred over the
contract period. Deferred costs on the origination of financing
receivables are recognized as a reduction in finance revenue
over the expected lives of the receivables using the interest
method. Income and deferred costs on the origination of
operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over
the scheduled lease terms in finance revenue.

are written-off to the allowance when the account is
considered uncollectible (see Note 12).
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill, and Other
Intangible Assets
The company evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets
(including equipment on operating leases, property and
equipment, goodwill, and other intangible assets) when events
or circumstances warrant such a review. Goodwill and
intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment
annually at the end of the third quarter of each fiscal year,
and more often if events or circumstances indicate a reduction
in the fair value below the carrying value. Goodwill is
allocated and reviewed for impairment by reporting units,
which consist primarily of the operating segments and certain
other reporting units. Goodwill is allocated to the reporting
unit in which the business that created the goodwill resides.
To test for goodwill impairment, the carrying value of each
reporting unit is compared with its fair value. If the carrying
value of the goodwill is considered impaired, the impairment is
measured as the excess of the reporting unit‚Äôs carrying value
over the fair value, with a limit of the goodwill allocated to
that reporting unit. If the carrying value of the long-lived
asset is considered impaired, a loss is recognized based on the
amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of
the asset (see Notes 5 and 26).
Derivative Financial Instruments
It is the company‚Äôs policy that derivative transactions are
executed only to manage exposures arising in the normal
course of business and not for the purpose of creating
speculative positions or trading. The company‚Äôs financial
services operations manage the relationship of the types and
amounts of their funding sources to their receivable and lease
portfolio in an effort to diminish risk due to interest rate and
foreign currency fluctuations, while responding to favorable
financing opportunities. The company also has foreign
currency exposures at some of its foreign and domestic
operations related to buying, selling, and financing in
currencies other than the functional currencies. In addition,
the company has interest rate exposure at certain equipment
operations units for below market retail financing programs
that are used as sales incentives and are offered for extended
periods.
All derivatives are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet.
Cash collateral received or paid is not offset against the
derivative fair values on the balance sheet. Each derivative is
designated as either a cash flow hedge or a fair value hedge
or remains undesignated. Changes in the fair value of
derivatives that are designated and effective as cash flow
hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI) and
reclassified to the income statement when the effects of the
item being hedged are recognized in the income statement.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated
and effective as fair value hedges are recognized currently in
net income. These changes are offset in net income to the
extent the hedge was effective by fair value changes related
to the risk being hedged on the hedged item. Changes in the
fair value of undesignated hedges are recognized currently in
the income statement. All ineffective changes in derivative fair
values are recognized currently in net income.

Sales Incentives
At the time a sale is recognized, the company records an
estimate of the future sales incentive costs for allowances and
financing programs that will be due when a dealer sells the
equipment to a retail customer. The estimate is based on
historical data, announced incentive programs, field inventory
levels, and retail sales volumes.
Product Warranties
At the time a sale is recognized, the company records the
estimated future warranty costs. These costs are usually
estimated based on historical warranty claims and
consideration of current quality developments (see Note 22).
Sales Taxes
The company collects and remits taxes assessed by different
governmental authorities that are both imposed on and
concurrent with revenue producing transactions between the
company and its customers. These taxes may include sales,
use, value-added, and some excise taxes. The company reports
the collection of these taxes on a net basis (excluded from
revenues).
Shipping and Handling Costs
Shipping and handling costs related to the sales of the
company‚Äôs equipment are included in cost of sales.
Advertising Costs
Advertising costs are charged to expense as incurred. This
expense was $188 million in 2018, $169 million in 2017, and
$169 million in 2016.
Depreciation and Amortization
Property and equipment, capitalized software, and other
intangible assets are generally stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation or amortization. These assets are depreciated
over their estimated useful lives generally using the
straight-line method. Equipment on operating leases is
depreciated over the terms of the leases using the
straight-line method. Property and equipment expenditures for
new and revised products, increased capacity, and the
replacement or major renewal of significant items are
capitalized. Expenditures for maintenance, repairs, and minor
renewals are generally charged to expense as incurred.
Securitization of Receivables
Certain financing receivables are periodically transferred to
special purpose entities (SPEs) in securitization transactions
(see Note 13). These securitizations qualify as collateral for
secured borrowings and no gains or losses are recognized at
the time of securitization. The receivables remain on the
balance sheet and are classified as ‚Äò‚ÄòFinancing receivables
securitized ‚Äì net.‚Äô‚Äô The company recognizes finance income
over the lives of these receivables using the interest method.
Receivables and Allowances
All financing and trade receivables are reported on the balance
sheet at outstanding principal adjusted for any charge-offs,
the allowance for credit losses, and any deferred fees or costs
on originated financing receivables. Allowances for credit
losses are maintained in amounts considered to be appropriate
in relation to the receivables outstanding based on collection
experience, economic conditions in the company‚Äôs major
markets and geographies, and credit risk quality. Receivables

42

42

All designated hedges are formally documented as to the
relationship with the hedged item as well as the
risk-management strategy. Both at inception and on an
ongoing basis the hedging instrument is assessed as to its
effectiveness. If and when a derivative is determined not to
be highly effective as a hedge, the underlying hedged
transaction is no longer likely to occur, the hedge designation
is removed, or the derivative is terminated, the hedge
accounting discussed above is discontinued (see Note 27).
Foreign Currency Translation
The functional currencies for most of the company‚Äôs foreign
operations are their respective local currencies. The assets and
liabilities of these operations are translated into U.S. dollars at
the end of the period exchange rates. The revenues and
expenses are translated at weighted-average rates for the
period. The gains or losses from these translations are
recorded in OCI. Gains or losses from transactions
denominated in a currency other than the functional currency
of the subsidiary involved and foreign exchange forward
contracts are included in net income. The pretax net loss for
foreign exchange in 2018, 2017, and 2016 was $8 million,
$62 million, and $38 million, respectively.
3. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

disclose provisional amounts related to tax reform. In addition,
the ASU allows for a measurement period up to one year after
the enactment date of tax reform to complete the related
accounting requirements and was effective when issued. The
company will complete the adjustments related to tax reform
within the allowed period. The effects of tax reform on the
company‚Äôs consolidated financial statements are outlined in
Note 8.
In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02,
Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Income, which amends ASC 220, Income
Statement ‚Äì Reporting Comprehensive Income. Included in the
provisions of tax reform is a reduction of the corporate
income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. Accounting
principles generally accepted in the U.S. require that deferred
taxes are remeasured to the new corporate tax rate in the
period legislation is enacted. The deferred tax adjustment is
recorded in the provision for income taxes, including items for
which the tax effects were originally recorded in OCI. This
treatment results in the items in OCI not reflecting the
appropriate tax rate, which are referred to as stranded tax
effects. This ASU allows a reclassification from accumulated
OCI to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting
from tax reform. The company early adopted this ASU in the
fourth quarter of 2018. The stranded tax effects reclassified
from OCI to retained earnings were $717 million.
New Accounting Standards to be Adopted
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue
from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which supersedes
the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605, Revenue
Recognition. This ASU is based on the principle that revenue
is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to
customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to
which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those
goods or services. The ASU also requires additional disclosure
about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue.
The FASB issued several amendments clarifying various
aspects of the ASU, including revenue transactions that
involve a third party, goods or services that are immaterial in
the context of the contract, and licensing arrangements. The
company will adopt the ASU effective the first quarter of
fiscal year 2019 using a modified-retrospective approach. The
ASU requires that a gross asset and liability rather than a net
liability be recorded for the value of estimated service parts
returns and the related refund liability. The gross asset will be
recorded in other assets for the inventory value of estimated
parts returns and the gross liability will be recorded in
accounts payable and accrued expenses for the estimated
dealer refund. The estimated increase in other assets and
accounts payable and accrued expenses will be approximately
$110 million. In addition, certain revenue disclosures will be
expanded to include contract liabilities and disaggregated
revenue by geographic regions and major product and services
lines. The adoption will not have other material effects on the
company‚Äôs consolidated financial statements.
In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,
Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities, which amends ASC 825-10, Financial
Instruments ‚Äì Overall. This ASU changes the treatment for
available-for-sale equity investments by recognizing unrealized

New Accounting Standards Adopted
In the first quarter of 2018, the company early adopted
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting
Standard Update (ASU) No. 2017-07, Improving the
Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic
Postretirement Benefit Cost, which amends Accounting
Standards Codification (ASC) 715, Compensation ‚Äì Retirement
Benefits. This ASU required that employers report only the
service cost component of the total defined benefit pension
and OPEB cost in the same income statement lines as
compensation for the participating employees. The other
components of these benefit costs are reported outside of
operating profit in the income statement line other operating
expenses. The ASU was adopted on a retrospective basis that
increased operating profit in fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016
by $15 million, $31 million, and $20 million, respectively. The
income statement line changes for fiscal years 2017 and 2016
were cost of sales decreased $67 million and $53 million,
research and development expenses increased $5 million and
$5 million, selling, administrative and general expenses
increased $31 million and $28 million, and other operating
expenses increased $31 million and $20 million, respectively. In
addition, only the service cost component of the benefit costs
is eligible for capitalization, which was adopted beginning the
first quarter of 2018.
In the first quarter of 2018, the company adopted ASU
No. 2016-07, Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method
of Accounting, which amends ASC 323, Investments ‚Äì Equity
Method and Joint Ventures, which did not have a material
effect on the company‚Äôs consolidated financial statements.
In March 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-05,
Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 118, which amends ASC 740, Income
Taxes. This ASU incorporates SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin
No. 118, which was also issued in December 2017, into the
ASC. The ASU provides guidance on when to record and

43

43

fair value changes directly in net income and no longer in
other comprehensive income. The effective date will be the
first quarter of fiscal year 2019. The ASU will be adopted with
a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet. The
available-for-sale equities balance at October 28, 2018 is
$46 million with an unrealized gain of $10 million. As a result,
the adoption will not have a material effect on the company‚Äôs
consolidated financial statements.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases
(Topic 842), which supersedes ASC 840, Leases. The ASU‚Äôs
primary change is the requirement for lessee entities to
recognize a lease liability for payments and a right of use
asset during the term of operating lease arrangements. The
ASU does not significantly change the lessee‚Äôs recognition,
measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows
from the previous accounting standard. Lessors‚Äô accounting
under the ASC is largely unchanged from the previous
accounting standard. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU
No. 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases
and ASU No. 2018-11, Leases: Targeted Improvements. Both
ASUs amend ASC 842, Leases. The provisions impacting the
company in these ASUs are an option that will not require
prior periods to be restated at the adoption date and an
option for lessors, if certain criteria are met, to avoid
separating the lease and nonlease components (such as
preventative maintenance services) in an agreement. In
December 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-20, NarrowScope Improvements for Lessors. This ASU provides an
election for lessors to exclude sales and related taxes from
consideration in the contract, requires lessors to exclude from
revenue and expense lessor costs paid directly to a third party
by lessees, and clarifies lessors accounting for variable
payments related to both lease and nonlease components. The
effective date will be the first quarter of fiscal year 2020,
with early adoption permitted. The company is evaluating the
potential effects on the consolidated financial statements and
plans to adopt the ASU using the modified-retrospective
approach that will not require prior periods to be restated.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Measurement
of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which establishes
ASC 326, Financial Instruments ‚Äì Credit Losses. The ASU
revises the measurement of credit losses for financial assets
measured at amortized cost from an incurred loss
methodology to an expected loss methodology. The ASU
affects trade receivables, debt securities, net investment in
leases, and most other financial assets that represent a right
to receive cash. Additional disclosures about significant
estimates and credit quality are also required. In November
2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-19, Codification
Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments ‚Äì Credit
Losses. This ASU clarifies that receivables from operating
leases are accounted for using the lease guidance and not as
financial instruments. The effective date will be the first
quarter of fiscal year 2021, with early adoption permitted
beginning in fiscal year 2020. The ASU will be adopted using
a modified-retrospective approach. The company is evaluating
the potential effects on the consolidated financial statements.
In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,
Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,

presentation of certain transactions where diversity in practice
exists. The effective date will be the first quarter of fiscal
year 2019 and will be adopted using a retrospective transition
approach. The adoption will not have a material effect on the
company‚Äôs consolidated financial statements.
In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, IntraEntity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory, which amends
ASC 740, Income Taxes. This ASU requires that the income tax
consequences of an intra-entity asset transfer other than
inventory are recognized at the time of the transfer. The
effective date will be the first quarter of fiscal year 2019. The
ASU will be adopted using a modified-retrospective transition
approach. The adoption will not have a material effect on the
company‚Äôs consolidated financial statements.
In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18,
Restricted Cash, which amends ASC 230, Statement of Cash
Flows. This ASU requires that a statement of cash flows
explain the change during the reporting period in the total of
cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash or restricted cash
equivalents. The effective date will be the first quarter of
fiscal year 2019 and will be adopted using a retrospective
transition approach. The adoption will not have a material
effect on the company‚Äôs consolidated financial statements.
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, Clarifying
the Definition of a Business, which amends ASC 805, Business
Combinations. This ASU provides further guidance on the
definition of a business to determine whether transactions
should be accounted for as acquisitions of assets or
businesses. The effective date will be the first quarter of fiscal
year 2019. The ASU will be adopted on a prospective basis
and will not have a material effect on the company‚Äôs
consolidated financial statements.
In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-08, Premium
Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt Securities, which
amends ASC 310-20, Receivables ‚Äì Nonrefundable Fees and
Other Costs. This ASU reduces the amortization period for
certain callable debt securities held at a premium to the
earliest call date. The treatment of securities held at a
discount is unchanged. The effective date is the first quarter
of fiscal year 2020, with early adoption permitted. The
adoption will not have a material effect on the company‚Äôs
consolidated financial statements.
In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09, Scope of
Modification Accounting, which amends ASC 718,
Compensation ‚Äì Stock Compensation. This ASU provides
guidance about which changes to the terms of a share-based
payment award should be accounted for as a modification. A
change to an award should be accounted for as a modification
unless the fair value of the modified award is the same as the
original award, the vesting conditions do not change, and the
classification as an equity or liability instrument does not
change. The ASU will be adopted on a prospective basis. The
effective date is the first quarter of fiscal year 2019. The
adoption will not have a material effect on the company‚Äôs
consolidated financial statements.
In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12, Targeted
Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities, which
amends ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. The purpose of

44

this ASU is to better align a company‚Äôs risk management
activities and financial reporting for hedging relationships,
simplify the hedge accounting requirements, and improve the
disclosures of hedging arrangements. The effective date is
fiscal year 2020, with early adoption permitted. The company
will adopt the ASU in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 and
the adoption will not have a material effect on the company‚Äôs
consolidated financial statements.
In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-07,
Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment
Accounting, which amends ASC 718, Compensation ‚Äì Stock
Compensation. This ASU requires that most of the guidance
related to stock compensation granted to employees be
followed for non-employees, including the measurement date,
valuation approach, and performance conditions. The expense
is recognized in the same period as though cash were paid for
the good or service. The effective date is the first quarter of
fiscal year 2020, with early adoption permitted, including in
interim periods. The ASU will be adopted using a modifiedretrospective transition approach. The adoption will not have a
material effect on the consolidated financial statements.

Framework ‚Äì Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair
Value Measurement, which amends ASC 820, Fair Value
Measurement. This ASU modifies the disclosure requirements
for fair value measurements by removing, modifying, or adding
certain disclosures. The effective date is the first quarter of
fiscal year 2021, with early adoption permitted for the
removed disclosures and delayed adoption until fiscal year
2021 permitted for the new disclosures. The removed and
modified disclosures will be adopted on a retrospective basis
and the new disclosures will be adopted on a prospective
basis. The company will early adopt the ASU in the first
quarter of fiscal year 2019. The adoption will not have a
material effect on the company‚Äôs consolidated financial
statements.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-14, Disclosure
Framework ‚Äì Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for
Defined Benefit Plans, which amends ASC 715-20,
Compensation ‚Äì Retirement Benefits ‚Äì Defined Benefit
Plans ‚Äì General. This ASU modifies the disclosure
requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit
pension or other postretirement plans by removing and adding
certain disclosures for these plans. The eliminated disclosures

assumed health care cost trend rates on the net periodic
benefit costs and the benefit obligation for postretirement
health care benefits. The new disclosures include the interest
crediting rates for cash balance plans, and an explanation of
significant gains and losses related to changes in benefit
obligations. The effective date is fiscal year 2021, with early
adoption permitted. The company will early adopt the ASU in
fiscal year 2019. The adoption will not have a material effect
on the company‚Äôs consolidated financial statements.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, Customer‚Äôs
Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud

Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract, which
amends ASC 350-40, Intangibles ‚Äì Goodwill and Other ‚Äì
Internal-Use Software. This ASU requires customers in a
hosting arrangement that is a service contract to evaluate the
implementation costs of the hosting arrangement using the
guidance to develop internal-use software. The project
development stage determines the implementation costs that
are capitalized or expensed. Capitalized implementation costs
are amortized over the term of the service arrangement and
are presented in the same income statement line item as the
service contract costs. The effective date will be the first
quarter of fiscal year 2021, with early adoption permitted. The
company will adopt the ASU on a prospective basis. The
company is evaluating the potential effects on the company‚Äôs
consolidated financial statements.
In October 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-16, Inclusion

The identifiable intangible assets‚Äô fair values in millions of
dollars and weighted-average useful lives in years follows:

The identifiable intangibles were primarily related to trade
name and technology, which have a weighted-average
amortization period of ten years. The goodwill is not expected
to be deductible for tax purposes.
Wirtgen
In December 2017, the company acquired Wirtgen, which was
a privately-held international company and is the leading
manufacturer worldwide of road construction equipment.
Headquartered in Germany, Wirtgen has six brands across the
road construction sector spanning processing, mixing, paving,
compaction, and rehabilitation. Wirtgen sells products in more
than 100 countries and had approximately 8,200 employees at
the acquisition date.
The total cash purchase price, net of cash acquired of
$191 million, was $5,136 million, a portion of which is held in
escrow to secure certain indemnity obligations of Wirtgen. In
addition to the cash purchase price, the company assumed
$1,641 million in liabilities, which represented substantially all
of Wirtgen‚Äôs liabilities. The company financed the acquisition
and associated transaction expenses from a combination of
cash and new debt financing, which consisted of medium-term
notes, including e850 million issued in September 2017. The

The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.
Wirtgen‚Äôs results are incorporated in the company‚Äôs
consolidated financial statements using a one-month lag
period and are included in the construction and forestry
segment. The net sales and revenues and operating profit
included in the company‚Äôs statement of consolidated income in
2018 was $3,181 million and $116 million, respectively. During
2018, the company recognized $56 million of acquisition
related costs, which were recorded $30 million in selling,
administrative and general expenses and $26 million in other
operating expenses.
The unaudited pro forma consolidated net sales and revenues

The pro forma amounts have been calculated using policies
consistent with the company‚Äôs accounting policies and include
the additional expense from the amortization from the
allocated purchase price adjustments. The pro forma results
exclude acquisition related costs incurred in both years and
assume the medium-term notes used to fund the acquisition
were issued in fiscal year 2016 at the interest rate of the
actual notes. In addition, the pro forma results for the year
ended October 29, 2017 include nonrecurring pretax expenses
of $291 million for the higher cost basis from the inventory
fair value adjustment and $84 million for the amortization of
identifiable intangible assets. Anticipated synergies or other
expected benefits of the acquisition are not included in the
pro forma results. As a result, the unaudited pro forma
financial information may not be indicative of the results for
future operations or the results if the acquisition closed at the
beginning of fiscal year 2017.
Blue River
In September 2017, the company acquired Blue River
Technology (Blue River), which is based in Sunnyvale, California
for an acquisition cost of approximately $284 million, net of
cash acquired of $4 million and $21 million funded to escrow
for post-acquisition expenses. Blue River has designed and
integrated computer vision and machine learning technology
to optimize the use of farm inputs. Machine learning
technologies could eventually be applied to a wide range of
the company‚Äôs products. The asset and liability fair values at

The goodwill is deductible for tax purposes. If certain events
occur, the minority interest holder has the right to exercise a
put option that would require the company to purchase the
holder‚Äôs membership interest. The company also has a call
option exercisable after a certain period of time. The put and
call options cannot be separated from the noncontrolling
interest. Due to the redemption features, the minority interest
holder‚Äôs value is classified as a redeemable noncontrolling
interest in the company‚Äôs consolidated balance sheet.
Monosem
In February 2016, the company acquired Monosem for a cost
of approximately $146 million, net of cash acquired of
$20 million. Monosem, with four facilities in France and two

the financial services operations (see Note 26).
Voluntary Employee-Separation Programs
During the fourth quarter of 2016, the company announced
voluntary employee-separation programs as part of its effort
to reduce operating costs. The programs provided for cash
payments based on previous years of service. The expense
was recorded in the period the employees accepted the
separation offer. The programs‚Äô total pretax expenses were
$113 million, of which $11 million was recorded in the fourth
quarter of 2016 and $102 million in 2017. The total 2017
expenses were allocated approximately 30 percent cost of
sales, 16 percent research and development, and 54 percent
selling, administrative and general. In addition, the expenses
were allocated 75 percent to agriculture and turf operations,
17 percent to the construction and forestry operations, and
8 percent to the financial services operations. Savings from
these programs were estimated to be approximately
$70 million in 2017.
Sale of Investment in Unconsolidated Affiliate
In December 2016, the company sold approximately 38 percent
of its interest in SiteOne Landscape Supply, Inc. (SiteOne)
resulting in gross proceeds of $114 million and a gain of
$105 million pretax or $66 million after-tax. In April 2017, the
company sold an additional 68 percent of its then remaining
interest in SiteOne resulting in gross proceeds of $184 million
and a gain of $176 million pretax or $111 million after-tax. In
July 2017, the company sold its remaining interest in SiteOne
resulting in gross proceeds of $98 million and a gain of
$94 million pretax or $59 million after-tax. The gains were
recorded in other income in the agriculture and turf operating
segment.
After the December 2016 sale, the company retained
approximately a 15 percent ownership interest in SiteOne and
approximately a 5 percent ownership interest after the April
sale. Prior to April 2017, the company‚Äôs representation on the
SiteOne board of directors allowed the company to exercise
significant influence, and therefore, the investment in SiteOne
was accounted for using the equity method. In March 2017,
the company reduced its representation on the SiteOne board
of directors. As a result, beginning April 2017 the investment
in SiteOne was recorded as an available-for-sale security and
presented in marketable securities.
In May 2016, the company received a distribution of
$60 million from SiteOne that reduced the company‚Äôs
investment in unconsolidated affiliates. The distribution
included $4 million of a return on investment, which is shown
in the statement of consolidated cash flows in undistributed
earnings of unconsolidated affiliates in net cash provided by
operating activities and $56 million of a return of investment
shown in other cash flows from investing activities. In May
2016, the company also sold approximately 30 percent of its
interest in SiteOne in an initial public offering and terminated
a service agreement resulting in gross proceeds of
approximately $81 million with a total gain of $75 million
pretax or $47 million after-tax. The gain was recorded in other
income in the agriculture and turf operating segment. The
company retained approximately a 24 percent ownership
interest in SiteOne after the May 2016 sale.

Dispositions
In May 2018, the company sold construction and forestry retail
locations in Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. At the time
of the sale, total assets were $74 million and liabilities were
approximately $2 million. The assets consisted of trade
accounts and notes receivable ‚Äì net of $3 million, inventory
of $52 million, property and equipment ‚Äì net of $11 million,
and goodwill of $8 million. The liabilities consisted of
$2 million of accounts payable and accrued expenses. The
total proceeds from the sale will be approximately $84 million,
with $67 million received in 2018. The remaining sales price is
due based on standard payment terms of new equipment sales
to independent dealers or refinanced wholesale terms. A
pretax gain of $12 million was recorded in other income in the
construction and forestry segment.
In November 2017, the company sold its construction and
forestry retail locations in Florida. At the time of the sale,
total assets were $93 million and liabilities were $1 million.
The assets consisted of inventory of $61 million, property and
equipment ‚Äì net of $21 million, goodwill of $10 million, and
$1 million of other assets. The liabilities consisted of $1 million
of accounts payable and accrued expenses. The total proceeds
from the sale will be approximately $105 million, with
$89 million received in 2018. The remaining sales price is due
based on standard payment terms of new equipment sales to
independent dealers or refinanced wholesale terms. A pretax
gain of $13 million was recorded in other income in the
construction and forestry segment.
For the retail location dispositions, the company sells
equipment, service parts, and provides other services to the
purchasers as independent dealers.
5. SPECIAL ITEMS
Impairments
In the fourth quarter of 2017, the company recorded a
non-cash charge of $40 million pretax in equity in loss of
unconsolidated affiliates for an other than temporary decline
in value of an investment in an international construction
equipment manufacturer with a $14 million income tax benefit
recorded in the provision for income taxes (see Note 26).
In the fourth quarter of 2016, the company recorded a
non-cash charge in cost of sales for the impairment of
long-lived assets of $13 million pretax and after-tax. The
assets are part of the company‚Äôs construction and forestry
operations in China. The impairment is the result of a decline
in forecasted financial performance that indicated it was
probable the future cash flows would not cover the carrying
amount of assets used to manufacture construction equipment
in that country. In addition, the company recorded a non-cash
charge of $12 million, pretax and after-tax, in equity in loss of
unconsolidated affiliates for an other than temporary decline
in value of an investment in a construction equipment joint
venture in Brazil (see Note 26).
In 2016, the company recorded non-cash charges in other
operating expenses of approximately $31 million pretax for the
impairment of equipment on operating leases and
approximately $29 million pretax on matured operating lease
inventory recorded in other assets. The impairment was the
result of lower estimated values of used agriculture and
construction equipment than originally estimated with the
probable effect that the future cash flows would not cover

6. CASH FLOW INFORMATION

7. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

For purposes of the statement of consolidated cash flows, the
company considers investments with purchased maturities of
three months or less to be cash equivalents. Substantially all
of the company‚Äôs short-term borrowings, excluding the current
maturities of long-term borrowings, mature or may require
payment within three months or less.
The equipment operations sell a significant portion of their
trade receivables to financial services. These intercompany
cash flows are eliminated in the consolidated cash flows.
All cash flows from the changes in trade accounts and notes
receivable (see Note 12) are classified as operating activities in
the statement of consolidated cash flows as these receivables
arise from sales to the company‚Äôs customers. Cash flows from
financing receivables that are related to sales to the
company‚Äôs customers (see Note 12) are also included in
operating activities. The remaining financing receivables are
related to the financing of equipment sold by independent
dealers and are included in investing activities.
The company had the following non-cash operating and
investing activities that were not included in the statement of
consolidated cash flows. The company transferred inventory to
equipment on operating leases of $855 million, $801 million,
and $685 million in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The
company also had accounts payable related to purchases of
property and equipment of $183 million, $108 million, and
$114 million at October 28, 2018, October 29, 2017, and
October 30, 2016, respectively.
Cash payments for interest and income taxes consisted of the
following in millions of dollars:

The company has several defined benefit pension plans and
other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans, primarily health
care and life insurance plans, covering its U.S. employees and
employees in certain foreign countries. The company uses an
October 31 measurement date for these plans.

The spot yield curve approach is used to estimate the service
and interest cost components of the net periodic pension and
OPEB costs by applying the specific spot rates along the yield
curve used to determine the benefit plan obligations to
relevant projected cash outflows. The components of net
periodic pension and OPEB cost excluding the service
component are included in the line item other operating
expenses in the Statement of Consolidated Income.

$11,485 million and $12,416 million, respectively.
The accumulated benefit obligations and fair value of plan
assets for pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations
in excess of plan assets were $1,710 million and $1,015 million,
respectively, at October 28, 2018 and $8,234 million and
$7,345 million, respectively, at October 29, 2017. The
projected benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets for
pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of
plan assets were $1,833 million and $1,029 million,
respectively, at October 28, 2018 and $9,059 million and

2019, gradually decreasing to 4.8 percent from 2024 to 2025
and all future years. The 2017 obligations and the cost in 2018
assumed an 8.9 percent increase from 2017 to 2018, gradually
decreasing to 4.8 percent from 2024 to 2025 and all future
years. An increase of one percentage point in the assumed
health care cost trend rate would increase the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligations by $644 million and the
aggregate of service and interest cost component of net
periodic OPEB cost for the year by $33 million. A decrease of
one percentage point would decrease the obligations by
$511 million and the cost by $26 million.
The discount rate assumptions used to determine the pension
and OPEB obligations for all periods presented were based on
hypothetical AA yield curves represented by a series of
annualized individual discount rates. These discount rates
represent the rates at which the company‚Äôs benefit obligations
could effectively be settled at the October 31 measurement
dates.
Fair value measurement levels in the following tables are
defined in Note 26.

Actuarial gains and losses are recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss). To the extent unamortized gains
and losses exceed 10% of the higher of the market-related
value of assets or the benefit obligation, the excess is
amortized as a component of net periodic cost over the
remaining service period of the active participants. For plans
in which all or almost all of the plan‚Äôs participants are
inactive, the amortization period is the remaining life
expectancy of the inactive participants.
The company expects to contribute approximately $70 million
to its pension plans and approximately $140 million to its
OPEB plans in 2019, which are primarily direct benefit
payments.

The annual rates of increase in the per capita cost of covered
health care benefits (the health care cost trend rates) used to
determine accumulated postretirement benefit obligations were

for pre- and post-65 age groups due to the effects of
Medicare. For the 2018 actuarial valuation, the
weighted-average composite trend rates for these obligations
were assumed to be an 8.9 percent increase from 2018 to

Fair values are determined as follows:
Cash and Short-Term Investments ‚Äì Includes accounts that are
valued based on the account value, which approximates fair
value, and investment funds that are valued based on a
constant fund net asset value (NAV) or on the fund‚Äôs NAV
based on the fair value of the underlying securities. Also
included are securities that are valued using a market
approach (matrix pricing model) in which all significant inputs

Equity Securities and Funds ‚Äì The values are determined
primarily by closing prices in the active market in which the
equity investment trades, or the fund‚Äôs NAV, based on the fair
value of the underlying securities.
Fixed Income Securities and Funds ‚Äì The securities are valued
using either a market approach (matrix pricing model) in which
all significant inputs are observable or can be derived from or
corroborated by observable market data such as interest rates,
yield curves, volatilities, credit risk, and prepayment speeds, or
they are valued using the closing prices in the active market
in which the fixed income investment trades. Fixed income
funds are valued using the fund‚Äôs NAV, based on the fair value
of the underlying securities.
Real Estate, Venture Capital, Private Equity, Hedge Funds, and
Other ‚Äì The investments that are structured as limited
partnerships are valued at estimated fair value based on their
proportionate share of the limited partnership‚Äôs fair value that
is determined by the respective general partner. These
investments are valued using a combination of NAV, an income
approach (primarily estimated cash flows discounted over the
expected holding period), or market approach (primarily the
valuation of similar securities and properties). Real estate
investment trusts are primarily valued at the closing prices in
the active markets in which the investment trades. Real estate
funds and other investments are primarily valued at NAV,
based on the fair value of the underlying securities.
Interest Rate, Foreign Currency, and Other Derivative
Instruments ‚Äì The derivatives are valued using either an
income approach (discounted cash flow) using market
observable inputs, including swap curves and both forward
and spot exchange rates, or a market approach (closing prices
in the active market in which the derivative instrument
trades).
The primary investment objective for the pension and health
care plans assets is to maximize the growth of these assets to
support the projected obligations to the beneficiaries over a
long period of time, and to do so in a manner that is
consistent with the company‚Äôs risk tolerance. The asset
allocation policy is the most important decision in managing
the assets and it is reviewed regularly. The asset allocation
policy considers the company‚Äôs long-term asset class risk/
return expectations since the obligations are long-term in
nature. The current target allocations for pension assets are
approximately 42 percent for equity securities, 34 percent for
debt securities, 6 percent for real estate, and 18 percent for
other investments. The target allocations for health care
assets are approximately 57 percent for equity securities,
30 percent for debt securities, 1 percent for real estate, and
12 percent for other investments. The allocation percentages
above include the effects of combining derivatives with other
investments to manage asset allocations and exposures to
interest rates and foreign currency exchange. The assets are
well diversified and are managed by professional investment
firms as well as by investment professionals who are company
employees. As a result of the company‚Äôs diversified investment
policy, there were no significant concentrations of risk.
The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects
management‚Äôs expectations of long-term average rates of

return on funds invested to provide for benefits included in
the projected benefit obligations. A market related value of
plan assets is used to calculate the expected return on assets.
The market related value recognizes changes in the fair value
of pension plan assets systematically over a five-year period.
The market related value of the health care plan assets equals
fair value. The expected return is based on the outlook for
inflation and for returns in multiple asset classes, while also
considering historical returns, asset allocation, and investment
strategy. The company‚Äôs approach has emphasized the
long-term nature of the return estimate such that the return
assumption is not changed significantly unless there are
fundamental changes in capital markets that affect the
company‚Äôs expectations for returns over an extended period of
time (i.e., 10 to 20 years). The average annual return of the
company‚Äôs U.S. pension fund was approximately 9.2 percent
during the past ten years and approximately 8.2 percent
during the past 20 years. Since return premiums over inflation
and total returns for major asset classes vary widely even over
ten-year periods, recent history is not necessarily indicative of
long-term future expected returns. The company‚Äôs systematic
methodology for determining the long-term rate of return for
the company‚Äôs investment strategies supports its long-term
expected return assumptions.
The company has created certain Voluntary Employees‚Äô
Beneficiary Association trusts (VEBAs) for the funding of
postretirement health care benefits. The future expected asset
returns for these VEBAs are lower than the expected return
on the other pension and health care plan assets due to
investment in a higher proportion of liquid securities. These
assets are in addition to the other postretirement health care
plan assets that have been funded under Section 401(h) of
the U.S. Internal Revenue Code and maintained in a separate
account in the company‚Äôs pension plan trust.
The company has defined contribution plans related to
employee investment and savings plans primarily in the U.S.
The company‚Äôs contributions and costs under these plans were
$206 million in 2018, $188 million in 2017, and $193 million in
2016. The contribution rate varies primarily based on the
company‚Äôs performance in the prior year and employee
participation in the plans.
8. INCOME TAXES
On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted tax
reform. The primary provisions of tax reform affecting the
company in 2018 were a reduction to the corporate income
tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and a transition from a
worldwide corporate tax system to a primarily territorial tax
system. The reduction in the corporate income tax rate
required the company to remeasure its U.S. net deferred tax
assets to the new corporate tax rate and the transition to a
territorial tax system requires payment of a one-time tax on
the deemed repatriation of undistributed and previously
untaxed non-U.S. earnings. Under current tax law, the
company plans to pay the deemed earnings repatriation tax
(repatriation tax) in 2019 with an expected U.S. income tax
overpayment.

Included in the Equipment Operations‚Äô repatriation tax amount
is an accrual of approximately $63 million for foreign
withholding taxes on earnings of subsidiaries outside the U.S.
that were previously expected to be indefinitely reinvested
outside the U.S. The provision for income taxes was also
affected primarily by the lower corporate income tax rate on
current year income.
The 21 percent corporate income tax rate was effective
January 1, 2018. Based on the company‚Äôs October fiscal year
end, the U.S. statutory income tax rate for fiscal year 2018
was approximately 23.3 percent.
The 2018 repatriation tax expense is based on interpretations
of existing laws, regulations, and certain assumptions. Further
regulatory guidance is expected, which could affect the
recorded expense. The company continues to analyze the
repatriation tax provisions, and monitor legislative and

At October 28, 2018, accumulated earnings in certain
subsidiaries outside the U.S. totaled $2,559 million, which
were subject to the repatriation tax. No provision for foreign
withholding taxes has been made because it is expected that
these earnings will remain indefinitely reinvested outside the
U.S. Determination of the amount of a foreign withholding tax
liability on these unremitted earnings is not practicable.
An additional $4,270 million of earnings in subsidiaries outside
the U.S., which were previously expected to be reinvested
outside the U.S., were also subject to the repatriation tax. In
the fourth quarter of 2018, the company reviewed its global
funding requirements and determined those earnings would
no longer be indefinitely reinvested. Although the earnings will
not be subject to U.S. income tax when repatriated to the
U.S., in the fourth quarter of 2018 an accrual of $63 million
was recorded for foreign withholding taxes.
Deferred income taxes arise because there are certain items
that are treated differently for financial accounting than for
income tax reporting purposes. An analysis of the deferred

Based upon the location of the company‚Äôs operations, the
consolidated income before income taxes in the U.S. in 2018,
2017, and 2016 was $2,275 million, $1,607 million, and
$967 million, respectively, and in foreign countries was
$1,796 million, $1,547 million, and $1,257 million, respectively.
Certain foreign operations are branches or partnerships of
Deere & Company and are subject to U.S. as well as foreign
income tax regulations. The pretax income by location and the
preceding analysis of the income tax provision by taxing
jurisdiction are not directly related.

2018

The amount of unrecognized tax benefits at October 28, 2018
and October 29, 2017 that would affect the effective tax rate
if the tax benefits were recognized was $128 million and
$86 million, respectively. The remaining liability was related to
tax positions for which there are offsetting tax receivables, or
the uncertainty was only related to timing. The company
expects that any reasonably possible change in the amounts
of unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months would
not be significant.
The company files its tax returns according to the tax laws of
the jurisdictions in which it operates, which includes the U.S.
federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions.
The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has completed the
examination of the company‚Äôs federal income tax returns for
periods prior to 2015. The years 2008 through 2014 returns
are subject to final approval on limited issues, of which the
tax effects are recorded. The years 2015, 2016, and 2017
federal income tax return are currently under examination.
Various state and foreign income tax returns, including major
tax jurisdictions in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China,
Finland, France, Germany, India, Mexico, Russia, Singapore,
and Spain also remain subject to examination by taxing
authorities.
The company‚Äôs policy is to recognize interest related to income
taxes in interest expense and interest income and recognize
penalties in selling, administrative and general expenses.
During 2018, 2017, and 2016, the total amount of expense
from interest and penalties was $23 million, $6 million, and
none and the interest income was $12 million, $6 million, and
none, respectively. At October 28, 2018 and October 29, 2017,
the liability for accrued interest and penalties totaled
$90 million and $66 million, respectively, and there was no
receivable for interest at either year-end.
The company will be subject to additional requirements of tax
reform beginning in 2019. Those provisions include a tax on
global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI), a tax determined
by base erosion and anti-abuse tax benefits (BEAT) from
certain payments between a U.S. corporation and foreign
subsidiaries, a limitation of certain executive compensation, a
deduction for foreign derived intangible income (FDII), and
interest expense limitations. Through the preliminary review of
these provisions, the company does not expect the net effect
to be significant for the 2019 provision for income taxes.

Deere & Company files a consolidated federal income tax
return in the U.S., which includes the wholly-owned financial
services subsidiaries. These subsidiaries account for income
taxes generally as if they filed separate income tax returns,
with a modification for realizability of certain tax benefits.
At October 28, 2018, tax loss and tax credit carryforwards of
$713 million were available with $289 million expiring from
2019 through 2038 and $424 million with an indefinite
carryforward period.

10. UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATED COMPANIES
Unconsolidated affiliated companies are companies in which
Deere & Company generally owns 20 percent to 50 percent of
the outstanding voting shares. Deere & Company does not
control these companies and accounts for its investments in
them on the equity basis. The investments in these companies
primarily consist of Bell Equipment Limited (31 percent
ownership), Deere-Hitachi Construction Machinery Corporation
(50 percent ownership), and Deere-Hitachi Maquinas de
Construcao do Brasil S.A. (50 percent ownership). In 2017, the
company sold its interest in SiteOne (see Note 5). The
unconsolidated affiliated companies primarily manufacture or
market equipment. Deere & Company‚Äôs share of the income or
loss of these companies is reported in the consolidated
income statement under ‚Äò‚ÄòEquity in income (loss) of
unconsolidated affiliates.‚Äô‚Äô The investment in these companies
is reported in the consolidated balance sheet under
‚Äò‚ÄòInvestments in unconsolidated affiliates.‚Äô‚Äô

respectively. The net write-offs were $16 million, $3 million,
and $7 million in fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016,
respectively. Currency translation impacted the allowance for
credit losses by $7 million, $2 million, and $(5) million in fiscal
years 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.
The equipment operations sell a significant portion of their
trade receivables to financial services and provide
compensation to these operations at approximate market rates
of interest.
Trade accounts and notes receivable primarily arise from sales
of goods to independent dealers. Under the terms of the
sales to dealers, interest is primarily charged to dealers on
outstanding balances, from the earlier of the date when goods
are sold to retail customers by the dealer or the expiration of
certain interest-free periods granted at the time of the sale to
the dealer, until payment is received by the company. Dealers
cannot cancel purchases after the equipment is shipped and
are responsible for payment even if the equipment is not sold
to retail customers. The interest-free periods are determined
based on the type of equipment sold and the time of year of
the sale. These periods range from one to twelve months for
most equipment. Interest-free periods may not be extended.
Interest charged may not be forgiven and the past due
interest rates exceed market rates. The company evaluates and
assesses dealers on an ongoing basis as to their
creditworthiness and generally retains a security interest in the
goods associated with the trade receivables. In certain
jurisdictions, the company is obligated to repurchase goods
sold to a dealer upon cancellation or termination of the
dealer‚Äôs contract for such causes as change in ownership and
closeout of the business.
Trade accounts and notes receivable include receivables from
sales to certain retail customers with payment terms less than
twelve months. The customer cannot cancel purchases or
return the equipment after delivery. The company evaluates
and assesses retail customers at the time of purchase as to
their creditworthiness and generally retains a security interest
in the goods associated with the receivables.
Trade accounts and notes receivable have significant
concentrations of credit risk in the agriculture and turf sector
and construction and forestry sector as shown in the previous
table. On a geographic basis, there is not a disproportionate
concentration of credit risk in any area.

Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities
because some securities may be called or prepaid. Because of
the potential for prepayment on mortgage-backed securities,
they are not categorized by contractual maturity. Proceeds
from the sales of available-for-sale securities were $40 million
in 2018, $403 million in 2017, and $62 million in 2016.
Realized gains were not significant in 2018 and 2016 and were
$275 million in 2017 (see Note 5). Realized losses, the increase
(decrease) in net unrealized gains or losses, and unrealized
losses that have been continuous for over twelve months were
not significant in 2018, 2017, and 2016. Unrealized losses at
October 28, 2018 and October 29, 2017 were primarily the
result of an increase in interest rates and were not recognized
in income due to the ability and intent to hold to maturity.
There were no significant impairment write-downs in the
periods reported.

scheduled as follows in millions of dollars:

The 2017 amounts in the table above for wholesale notes and
revolving charge accounts were adjusted to be comparable
with 2018 by separately presenting the unearned finance
income. In the prior year, these balances were shown net of
unearned finance income. The total financing receivables ‚Äì net
balance did not change. The residual values for investments in
financing leases at October 28, 2018 and October 29, 2017
totaled $294 million and $244 million, respectively.
Financing receivables have significant concentrations of credit
risk in the agriculture and turf sector and construction and
forestry sector as shown in the previous table. On a
geographic basis, there is not a disproportionate concentration
of credit risk in any area. The company generally retains as
collateral a security interest in the equipment associated with
retail notes, wholesale notes, and financing leases.

The maximum terms for retail notes are generally seven years
for agriculture and turf equipment and five years for
construction and forestry equipment. The maximum term for
financing leases is generally six years, while the average term
for wholesale notes is less than twelve months.
At October 28, 2018 and October 29, 2017, worldwide
financing receivables administered, which include financing
receivables administered but not owned, totaled
$31,082 million and $29,273 million, respectively.
Past due balances of financing receivables still accruing
finance income represent the total balance held (principal plus
accrued interest) with any payment amounts 30 days or more
past the contractual payment due date. Non-performing
financing receivables represent loans for which the company
has ceased accruing finance income. These receivables are
generally 120 days delinquent and the estimated uncollectible
amount, after charging the dealer‚Äôs withholding account, has
been written off to the allowance for credit losses. Finance
income for non-performing receivables is recognized on a cash
basis. Accrual of finance income is generally resumed when
the receivable becomes contractually current and collections
are reasonably assured.

losses represented .57 percent and .64 percent of financing
receivables outstanding at October 28, 2018 and October 29,
2017, respectively. In addition, at October 28, 2018 and
October 29, 2017, the company‚Äôs financial services operations
had $156 million and $155 million, respectively, of deposits
primarily withheld from dealers and merchants available for
potential credit losses.
Financing receivables are considered impaired when it is
probable the company will be unable to collect all amounts
due according to the contractual terms. Receivables reviewed
for impairment generally include those that are past due, have
provided bankruptcy notification, or require significant
collection efforts. Receivables that are impaired are generally
classified as non-performing.

October 28, 2018 and October 29, 2017 follows in millions of

The company, as a part of its overall funding strategy,
periodically transfers certain financing receivables (retail notes)
into VIEs that are SPEs, or non-VIE banking operations, as
part of its asset-backed securities programs (securitizations).
The structure of these transactions is such that the transfer
of the retail notes did not meet the accounting criteria for
sales of receivables, and is, therefore, accounted for as a
secured borrowing. SPEs utilized in securitizations of retail
notes differ from other entities included in the company‚Äôs
consolidated statements because the assets they hold are
legally isolated. Use of the assets held by the SPEs or the
non-VIEs is restricted by terms of the documents governing
the securitization transactions.
In these securitizations, the retail notes are transferred to
certain SPEs or to non-VIE banking operations, which in turn
issue debt to investors. The debt securities issued to the third
party investors result in secured borrowings, which are
recorded as ‚Äò‚ÄòShort-term securitization borrowings‚Äô‚Äô on the
consolidated balance sheet. The securitized retail notes are
recorded as ‚Äò‚ÄòFinancing receivables securitized ‚Äì net‚Äô‚Äô on the
balance sheet. The total restricted assets on the balance sheet
related to these securitizations include the financing
receivables securitized less an allowance for credit losses, and
other assets primarily representing restricted cash. For those
securitizations in which retail notes are transferred into SPEs,
the SPEs supporting the secured borrowings are consolidated
unless the company does not have both the power to direct
the activities that most significantly impact the SPEs‚Äô
economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or
the right to receive benefits that could potentially be
significant to the SPEs. No additional support to these SPEs
beyond what was previously contractually required has been
provided during the reporting periods.
In certain securitizations, the company consolidates the SPEs
since it has both the power to direct the activities that most
significantly impact the SPEs‚Äô economic performance through
its role as servicer of all the receivables held by the SPEs, and
the obligation through variable interests in the SPEs to absorb
losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant
to the SPEs. The restricted assets (retail notes securitized,
allowance for credit losses, and other assets) of the
consolidated SPEs totaled $2,593 million and $2,631 million at
October 28, 2018 and October 29, 2017, respectively. The

A troubled debt restructuring is generally the modification of
debt in which a creditor grants a concession it would not
otherwise consider to a debtor that is experiencing financial
difficulties. These modifications may include a reduction of
the stated interest rate, an extension of the maturity dates, a
reduction of the face amount or maturity amount of the debt,
or a reduction of accrued interest. During 2018, 2017, and
2016, the company identified 587, 474, and 167 financing
receivable contracts, primarily retail notes, as troubled debt
restructurings with aggregate balances of $34 million,
$16 million, and $19 million pre-modification and $34 million,
$15 million, and $18 million post-modification, respectively. In
2017, there were $3 million of troubled debt restructurings
that subsequently defaulted and were written off. In 2018 and
2016, there were no significant troubled debt restructurings

interest) of these SPEs totaled $2,520 million and
$2,571 million at October 28, 2018 and October 29, 2017,
respectively. The credit holders of these SPEs do not have
legal recourse to the company‚Äôs general credit.
In certain securitizations, the company transfers retail notes to
non-VIE banking operations, which are not consolidated since
the company does not have a controlling interest in the
entities. The company‚Äôs carrying values and interests related to
the securitizations with the unconsolidated non-VIEs were
restricted assets (retail notes securitized, allowance for credit
losses and other assets) of $504 million and $478 million at
October 28, 2018 and October 29, 2017, respectively. The
liabilities (short-term securitization borrowings and accrued
interest) were $475 million and $454 million at October 28,
2018 and October 29, 2017, respectively.
In certain securitizations, the company transfers retail notes
into bank-sponsored, multi-seller, commercial paper conduits,
which are SPEs that are not consolidated. The company does
not service a significant portion of the conduits‚Äô receivables,
and therefore, does not have the power to direct the
activities that most significantly impact the conduits‚Äô
economic performance. These conduits provide a funding
source to the company (as well as other transferors into the
conduit) as they fund the retail notes through the issuance of
commercial paper. The company‚Äôs carrying values and variable
interest related to these conduits were restricted assets (retail
notes securitized, allowance for credit losses, and other assets)
of $1,033 million and $1,155 million at October 28, 2018 and
October 29, 2017, respectively. The liabilities (short-term
securitization borrowings and accrued interest) related to
these conduits were $965 million and $1,096 million at
October 28, 2018 and October 29, 2017, respectively.
The company‚Äôs carrying amount of the liabilities to the
unconsolidated conduits, compared to the maximum exposure
to loss related to these conduits, which would only be
incurred in the event of a complete loss on the restricted
assets, was as follows at October 28 in millions of dollars:

Operating leases arise primarily from the leasing of John Deere
equipment to retail customers. Initial lease terms generally
range from 12 to 60 months. Net equipment on operating

equipment was $1,515 million and $1,315 million at October 28,
2018 and October 29, 2017, respectively. The corresponding
depreciation expense was $928 million in 2018, $853 million
in 2017, and $742 million in 2016.
Future payments to be received on operating leases totaled
$2,309 million at October 28, 2018 and are scheduled in
millions of dollars as follows: 2019 ‚Äì $980, 2020 ‚Äì $688,

The secured borrowings related to these restricted securitized
retail notes are obligations that are payable as the retail notes
are liquidated. Repayment of the secured borrowings depends
primarily on cash flows generated by the restricted assets.
Due to the company‚Äôs short-term credit rating, cash
collections from these restricted assets are not required to be
placed into a segregated collection account until immediately
prior to the time payment is required to the secured creditors.
At October 28, 2018, the maximum remaining term of all
securitized retail notes was approximately six years.

15. INVENTORIES
A majority of inventory owned by Deere & Company and its
U.S. equipment subsidiaries are valued at cost, on the ‚Äò‚Äòlast-in,
first-out‚Äô‚Äô (LIFO) basis. Remaining inventories are generally
valued at the lower of cost, on the ‚Äò‚Äòfirst-in, first-out‚Äô‚Äô (FIFO)
basis, or net realizable value. The value of gross inventories on
the LIFO basis at October 28, 2018 and October 29, 2017
represented 54 percent and 61 percent, respectively, of
worldwide gross inventories at FIFO value. If all inventories
had been valued on a FIFO basis, estimated inventories by

in April 2019, and $750 million, expiring in October 2019. In
addition, total credit lines included long-term credit facility
agreements of $2,500 million, expiring in April 2021, and
$2,500 million, expiring in April 2022. The agreements are
mutually extendable and the annual facility fees are not
significant. These credit agreements require Capital
Corporation to maintain its consolidated ratio of earnings to
fixed charges at not less than 1.05 to 1 for each fiscal quarter
and the ratio of senior debt, excluding securitization
indebtedness, to capital base (total subordinated debt and
stockholder‚Äôs equity excluding accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss)) at not more than 11 to 1 at the
end of any fiscal quarter. The credit agreements also require
the equipment operations to maintain a ratio of total debt to
total capital (total debt and stockholders‚Äô equity excluding
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)) of 65 percent
or less at the end of each fiscal quarter. Under this provision,
the company‚Äôs excess equity capacity and retained earnings
balance free of restriction at October 28, 2018 was
$12,368 million. Alternatively under this provision, the
equipment operations had the capacity to incur additional
debt of $22,969 million at October 28, 2018. All of these
requirements of the credit agreements have been met during
the periods included in the consolidated financial statements.
Deere & Company has an agreement with Capital Corporation
pursuant to which it has agreed to continue to own, directly
or through one or more wholly-owned subsidiaries, at least
51 percent of the voting shares of capital stock of Capital
Corporation and to maintain Capital Corporation‚Äôs consolidated
tangible net worth at not less than $50 million. This
agreement also obligates Deere & Company to make payments
to Capital Corporation such that its consolidated ratio of
earnings to fixed charges is not less than 1.05 to 1 for each
fiscal quarter. Deere & Company‚Äôs obligations to make
payments to Capital Corporation under the agreement are
independent of whether Capital Corporation is in default on
its indebtedness, obligations or other liabilities. Further,
Deere & Company‚Äôs obligations under the agreement are not
measured by the amount of Capital Corporation‚Äôs
indebtedness, obligations or other liabilities. Deere &
Company‚Äôs obligations to make payments under this
agreement are expressly stated not to be a guaranty of any
specific indebtedness, obligation or liability of Capital
Corporation and are enforceable only by or in the name of
Capital Corporation. No payments were required under this
agreement during the periods included in the consolidated
financial statements.

Total short-term borrowings ................................ $15,019 $14,154
* Includes unamortized fair value adjustments related to interest rate swaps.

The short-term securitization borrowings are secured by
financing receivables (retail notes) on the balance sheet (see
Note 13). Although these securitization borrowings are
classified as short-term since payment is required if the retail
notes are liquidated early, the payment schedule for these
borrowings, which are net of debt acquisition costs, at
October 28, 2018 based on the expected liquidation of the
retail notes in millions of dollars is as follows: 2019 ‚Äì $2,161,
2020 ‚Äì $1,076, 2021 ‚Äì $546, 2022 ‚Äì $168, 2023 ‚Äì $11, and
2024 ‚Äì $1.
The weighted-average interest rates on total short-term
borrowings, excluding current maturities of long-term
borrowings, at October 28, 2018 and October 29, 2017 were
3.0 percent and 1.8 percent, respectively.
Lines of credit available from U.S. and foreign banks were
$8,389 million at October 28, 2018. At October 28, 2018,
$3,724 million of these worldwide lines of credit were unused.
For the purpose of computing the unused credit lines,
commercial paper, and short-term bank borrowings, excluding
secured borrowings and the current portion of long-term
borrowings, were primarily considered to constitute utilization.
Included in the total credit lines at October 28, 2018 were
364-day credit facility agreements of $1,750 million, expiring

23. CAPITAL STOCK

22. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
The company generally determines its total warranty liability
by applying historical claims rate experience to the estimated
amount of equipment that has been sold and is still under
warranty based on dealer inventories and retail sales. The
historical claims rate is primarily determined by a review of
five-year claims costs and current quality developments.
The premiums for extended warranties are primarily recognized
in income in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred
over the contract period. The unamortized extended warranty
premiums (deferred revenue) included in the following table
totaled $506 million and $461 million at October 28, 2018 and
October 29, 2017, respectively.
A reconciliation of the changes in the warranty liability and

The number of common shares the company is authorized to
issue is 1,200 million. The number of authorized preferred
shares, none of which has been issued, is nine million.
The Board of Directors at its meeting in December 2013
authorized the repurchase of up to $8,000 million of common
stock (60.2 million shares based on the fiscal year end closing
common stock price of $133.00 per share). At the end of the
fiscal year, this repurchase program had $2,312 million
(17.4 million shares at the same price) remaining to be
repurchased. Repurchases of the company‚Äôs common stock
under this plan will be made from time to time, at the
company‚Äôs discretion, in the open market.

At October 28, 2018, the company had approximately
$357 million of guarantees issued primarily to banks outside
the U.S. and Canada related to third-party receivables for the
retail financing of John Deere and Wirtgen equipment. The
increase from October 29, 2017 primarily relates to the
Wirtgen acquisition. The company may recover a portion of
any required payments incurred under these agreements from
repossession of the equipment collateralizing the receivables.
At October 28, 2018, the company recorded a liability of
approximately $14 million under these agreements. The
maximum remaining term of the receivables guaranteed at
October 28, 2018 was approximately seven years.
At October 28, 2018, the company had commitments of
approximately $289 million for the construction and
acquisition of property and equipment. Also at October 28,
2018, the company had restricted assets of $111 million,
classified as ‚Äò‚ÄòOther Assets‚Äô‚Äô. See Note 13 for additional
restricted assets associated with borrowings related to
securitizations.
The company also had other miscellaneous contingent
liabilities totaling approximately $155 million at October 28,
2018. The accrued liability for these contingencies was
approximately $20 million at October 28, 2018.
The company is subject to various unresolved legal actions
which arise in the normal course of its business, the most
prevalent of which relate to product liability (including
asbestos related liability), retail credit, employment, patent,
and trademark matters. The company believes the reasonably

24. STOCK OPTION AND RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS
The company issues stock options and restricted stock awards
to key employees under plans approved by stockholders.
Restricted stock is also issued to nonemployee directors for
their services as directors under a plan approved by
stockholders. Options are awarded with the exercise price

65

65

equal to the market price and become exercisable in one to
three years after grant. Options expire ten years after the
date of grant. Restricted stock awards generally vest after
three years. The compensation cost for stock options, service
based restricted stock units, and market/service based
restricted stock units, which is based on the fair value at the
grant date, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the
requisite period the employee is required to render service.
The compensation cost for performance/service based units,
which is based on the fair value at the grant date, is
recognized over the employees‚Äô requisite service period and
periodically adjusted for the probable number of shares to be
awarded. According to these plans at October 28, 2018, the
company is authorized to grant an additional 10.0 million
shares related to stock options or restricted stock.
The fair value of each option award was estimated on the
date of grant using a binomial lattice option valuation model.
Expected volatilities are based on implied volatilities from
traded call options on the company‚Äôs stock. The expected
volatilities are constructed from the following three
components: the starting implied volatility of short-term call
options traded within a few days of the valuation date; the
predicted implied volatility of long-term call options; and the
trend in implied volatilities over the span of the call options‚Äô
time to maturity. The company uses historical data to estimate
option exercise behavior and employee termination within the
valuation model. The expected term of options granted is
derived from the output of the option valuation model and
represents the period of time that options granted are
expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rates utilized for
periods throughout the contractual life of the options are
based on U.S. Treasury security yields at the time of grant.
The assumptions used for the binomial lattice model to
determine the fair value of options follow:
2018

2017

The weighted-average grant-date fair values of options
granted during 2018, 2017, and 2016 were $39.11, $24.46, and
$16.88, respectively. The total intrinsic values of options
exercised during 2018, 2017, and 2016 were $229 million,
$225 million, and $23 million, respectively. During 2018, 2017,
and 2016, cash received from stock option exercises was
$217 million, $529 million, and $36 million with tax benefits of
$54 million, $83 million, and $8 million, respectively.
The company granted 415 thousand, 579 thousand, and
255 thousand restricted stock units to employees and
nonemployee directors in 2018, 2017, and 2016, of which
330 thousand, 465 thousand, and 113 thousand are subject to
service based only conditions, 85 thousand, 57 thousand, and
71 thousand are subject to performance/service based
conditions, and none, 57 thousand, and 71 thousand are
subject to market/service based conditions, respectively. The
service based only units award one share of common stock for
each unit at the end of the vesting period and include
dividend equivalent payments.
The performance/service based units are subject to a
performance metric based on the company‚Äôs compound annual
revenue growth rate, compared to a benchmark group of
companies over the vesting period. The market/service based
units are subject to a market related metric based on total
shareholder return, compared to the same benchmark group
of companies over the vesting period. The performance/service
based units and the market/service based units both award
common stock in a range of zero to 200 percent for each unit
granted based on the level of the metric achieved and do not
include dividend equivalent payments over the vesting period.
The weighted-average fair values of the service based only
units at the grant dates during 2018, 2017, and 2016 were
$151.67, $101.03, and $79.84 per unit, respectively, based on
the market price of a share of underlying common stock. The
fair value of the performance/service based units at the grant
date during 2018, 2017, and 2016 were $145.33, $93.86, and
$72.93 per unit, respectively, based on the market price of a
share of underlying common stock excluding dividends. The
fair value of the market/service based units at the grant date
during 2017 and 2016 were $129.70 and $103.66 per unit,
respectively, based on a lattice valuation model excluding
dividends.

During 2018, 2017, and 2016, the total share-based
compensation expense was $84 million, $68 million, and
$71 million, respectively, with recognized income tax benefits
of $20 million, $25 million, and $26 million, respectively. At
October 28, 2018, there was $47 million of total unrecognized
compensation cost from share-based compensation
arrangements granted under the plans, which is related to
restricted shares and options. This compensation is expected
to be recognized over a weighted-average period of
approximately two years. The total grant-date fair values of
stock options and restricted shares vested during 2018, 2017,
and 2016 were $63 million, $72 million, and $69 million,
respectively.
The company currently uses shares that have been
repurchased through its stock repurchase programs to satisfy
share option exercises. At fiscal year end, the company had
218 million shares in treasury stock and 17 million shares
remaining to be repurchased under its current publicly
announced repurchase program (see Note 23).

26. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to
sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement
date. To determine fair value, the company uses various
methods including market and income approaches. The
company utilizes valuation models and techniques that
maximize the use of observable inputs. The models are
industry-standard models that consider various assumptions
including time values and yield curves as well as other

68

68

economic measures. These valuation techniques are
consistently applied.
Level 1 measurements consist of quoted prices in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 measurements
include significant other observable inputs such as quoted
prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; identical
assets or liabilities in inactive markets; observable inputs such
as interest rates and yield curves; and other marketcorroborated inputs. Level 3 measurements include significant
unobservable inputs.
The fair values of financial instruments that do not
approximate the carrying values at October 28, 2018 and
October 29, 2017 in millions of dollars follow:

discounted values of their related cash flows at current market
interest rates. Certain long-term borrowings have been
swapped to current variable interest rates. The carrying values
of these long-term borrowings included adjustments related to
fair value hedges.
Assets and liabilities measured at October 28, 2018 and
October 29, 2017 at fair value on a recurring basis in millions
of dollars follow:

October 28, 2018 and October 29, 2017, respectively, the fixed income fund
of $15 million at October 29, 2017, and U.S. government debt securities of
$44 million and $44 million at October 28, 2018 and October 29, 2017,
respectively. In addition, $8 million and $17 million of the international debt
securities were Level 3 measurements at October 28, 2018 and October 29,
2017, respectively. There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during
2018 and 2017.
** Primarily issued by U.S. government sponsored enterprises.
*** Excluded from this table were cash equivalents, which were carried at cost
that approximates fair value. The cash equivalents consist primarily of money
market funds and time deposits.

* Fair value measurements above were Level 3 for all financing receivables,
Level 3 for equipment operations short-term securitization borrowings, and
Level 2 for all other borrowings.
** See Note 4.

Fair value, recurring Level 3 measurements from available-for-sale

Cash Flow Hedges
Certain interest rate and cross-currency interest rate contracts
(swaps) were designated as hedges of future cash flows from
borrowings. The total notional amounts of the receivevariable/pay-fixed interest rate contracts at October 28, 2018
and October 29, 2017 were $3,050 million and $1,700 million,
respectively. The total notional amounts of the cross-currency
interest rate contracts were none and $22 million at
October 28, 2018 and October 29, 2017, respectively. The
effective portions of the fair value gains or losses on these
cash flow hedges were recorded in OCI and subsequently
reclassified into interest expense or other operating expenses
(foreign exchange) in the same periods during which the
hedged transactions affected earnings. These amounts offset
the effects of interest rate or foreign currency exchange rate
changes on the related borrowings. Any ineffective portions of
the gains or losses on all cash flow interest rate contracts
designated as cash flow hedges were recognized currently in
interest expense or other operating expenses (foreign
exchange) and were not material during any years presented.
The cash flows from these contracts were recorded in
operating activities in the statement of consolidated cash
flows.
The amount of gain recorded in OCI at October 28, 2018 that
is expected to be reclassified to interest expense or other
operating expenses in the next twelve months if interest rates
or exchange rates remain unchanged is approximately
$10 million after-tax. These contracts mature in up to
26 months. There were no gains or losses reclassified from
OCI to earnings based on the probability that the original
forecasted transaction would not occur.
Fair Value Hedges
Certain interest rate contracts (swaps) were designated as fair
value hedges of borrowings. The total notional amounts of
the receive-fixed/pay-variable interest rate contracts at
October 28, 2018 and October 29, 2017 were $8,479 million
and $8,661 million, respectively. The effective portions of the
fair value gains or losses on these contracts were offset by
fair value gains or losses on the hedged items (fixed-rate
borrowings). Any ineffective portions of the gains or losses
were recognized currently in interest expense. The ineffective
portions were losses of $2 million in both 2018 and 2016, and
a gain of $3 million in 2017. The cash flows from these
contracts were recorded in operating activities in the
statement of consolidated cash flows.

* Fair value at October 29, 2017 was a Level 1 measurement. See financing
receivables with specific allowances in Note 12 that were not significant.
See Note 5 for impairments.

The following is a description of the valuation methodologies
the company uses to measure certain financial instruments on
the balance sheet at fair value:
Marketable Securities ‚Äì The portfolio of investments, except
for the Level 3 measurement international debt securities, is
primarily valued on a market approach (matrix pricing model)
in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived
from or corroborated by observable market data such as
interest rates, yield curves, volatilities, credit risk, and
prepayment speeds. Funds are primarily valued using the
fund‚Äôs net asset value, based on the fair value of the
underlying securities. The Level 3 measurement international
debt securities are primarily valued using an income approach
based on discounted cash flows using yield curves derived
from limited, observable market data.
Derivatives ‚Äì The company‚Äôs derivative financial instruments
consist of interest rate swaps and caps, foreign currency
futures, forwards and swaps, and cross-currency interest rate
swaps. The portfolio is valued based on an income approach
(discounted cash flow) using market observable inputs,
including swap curves and both forward and spot exchange
rates for currencies.
Financing Receivables ‚Äì Specific reserve impairments are based
on the fair value of the collateral, which is measured using a
market approach (appraisal values or realizable values). Inputs
include a selection of realizable values (see Note 12).
Equipment on Operating Leases - Net ‚Äì The impairments are
based on an income approach (discounted cash flow), using
the contractual payments, plus an estimate of equipment sale
price at lease maturity. Inputs include realized sales values (see
Note 5).
Property and Equipment - Net ‚Äì The impairments are
measured at the lower of the carrying amount, or fair value.
The valuations were based on a cost approach. The inputs
include replacement cost estimates adjusted for physical
deterioration and economic obsolescence (see Note 5).
Investment in Unconsolidated Affiliates ‚Äì Other than temporary
impairments for investments are measured as the difference

accrued interest income of $11 million, $79 million, and $146 million during
2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.
** Includes adjustments for fair values of hedged borrowings excluding
accrued interest expense of $246 million, $243 million, and $290 million
during 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments
The company has certain interest rate contracts (swaps and
caps), foreign exchange contracts (futures, forwards and
swaps), and cross-currency interest rate contracts (swaps),
which were not formally designated as hedges. These
derivatives were held as economic hedges for underlying
interest rate or foreign currency exposures primarily for certain
borrowings, purchases or sales of inventory, and below market
retail financing programs. The total notional amounts of the
interest rate swaps at October 28, 2018 and October 29, 2017
were $8,075 million and $6,757 million, the foreign exchange
contracts were $6,842 million and $8,499 million, and the
cross-currency interest rate contracts were $81 million and
$66 million, respectively. The increase in the total notional
amount of interest rate swaps primarily relates to the
equipment operation‚Äôs economic hedge of announced retail
financing programs. The decrease in the total notional
amounts of foreign exchange contracts primarily relates to the
Wirtgen acquisition, which closed in December 2017 (see
Note 4). At October 28, 2018 and October 29, 2017, there
were also $66 million and $253 million, respectively, of
interest rate caps purchased and the same amounts sold at
the same capped interest rate to facilitate borrowings through
securitization of retail notes. The fair value gains or losses
from the interest rate contracts were recognized currently in
interest expense and the gains or losses from foreign
exchange contracts in cost of sales or other operating
expenses, generally offsetting over time the expenses on the
exposures being hedged. The cash flows from these
non-designated contracts were recorded in operating activities
in the statement of consolidated cash flows.

Counterparty Risk and Collateral
Derivative instruments are subject to significant concentrations
of credit risk to the banking sector. The company manages
individual counterparty exposure by setting limits that consider

71

71

the credit rating of the counterparty, the credit default swap
spread of the counterparty, and other financial commitments
and exposures between the company and the counterparty
banks. All interest rate derivatives are transacted under
International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA)
documentation. Some of these agreements include credit
support provisions. Each master agreement permits the net
settlement of amounts owed in the event of default or
termination.
Certain of the company‚Äôs derivative agreements contain credit
support provisions that may require the company to post
collateral based on the size of the net liability positions and
credit ratings. The aggregate fair value of all derivatives with
credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a net
liability position at October 28, 2018 and October 29, 2017,
was $350 million and $132 million, respectively. In accordance
with the limits established in these agreements, the company
posted $59 million in cash collateral at October 28, 2018. No
cash collateral was posted at October 29, 2017.
Derivatives are recorded without offsetting for netting
arrangements or collateral. The impact on the derivative assets
and liabilities related to netting arrangements and any
collateral paid at October 28, 2018 and October 29, 2017 in
millions of dollars follows:

The products and services produced by the segments above
are marketed primarily through independent retail dealer
networks and major retail outlets.
The financial services segment primarily finances sales and
leases by John Deere dealers of new and used agriculture and
turf equipment and construction and forestry equipment. In
addition, the financial services segment provides wholesale
financing to dealers of the foregoing equipment, finances
retail revolving charge accounts, and offers extended
equipment warranties.
Because of integrated manufacturing operations and common
administrative and marketing support, a substantial number of
allocations must be made to determine operating segment and
geographic area data. Intersegment sales and revenues
represent sales of components and finance charges, which are
generally based on market prices.
Information relating to operations by operating segment in
millions of dollars follows for the years ended October 28,
2018, October 29, 2017, and October 30, 2016. In addition to
the following unaffiliated sales and revenues by segment,
intersegment sales and revenues in 2018, 2017, and 2016 were
as follows: agriculture and turf net sales of $47 million,
$39 million, and $31 million, construction and forestry net
sales of none, $1 million, and $1 million, and financial services
revenues of $308 million, $244 million, and $225 million,
