Strategic & operational risks
Risk description and impact

Economy and markets
Global and regional economic
conditions may have a negative
effect on several products. The
impact of these conditions on the
overall portfolio will depend on the
severity of the economic slowdown,
the countries affected, and potential
government responses. Our more
cyclical products may be especially
sensitive to economic conditions.
This includes training activities,
advertising, books, and lending and
corporate formation-related
transactions. The non-recurring
activities are decreasing and
currently represent 24% of the
company’s consolidated revenues.

Products
The decline of revenues coming from
our legacy print business, including
books and print-based
subscriptions, may further
accelerate. Changes in underlying
customer dynamics may affect our
business and could lead to price
compression.

Competition
Wolters Kluwer faces competitive
challenges from existing and new
competitors, including free
availability of some sources of
information.

Mitigation

The company made further progress in shifting its portfolio towards
digital and high-growth businesses. The revenues are also created in an
increasing number of countries, further spreading risk. The percentage of
our recurring revenues is 76%, which contributes to our resiliency. During
the year, we continued to re-shape the business through strategic
acquisitions and divestments.

The company mitigates the decline of print-related revenues through
migration plans (upgrading customers from print to digital products),
customer retention management, and upselling opportunities. The
company will continue assessing opportunities to optimize the portfolio,
including the divestment of legacy businesses and the acquisition of
businesses which contribute to the execution of our strategy. The
company also continues to invest in product development and expand its
offerings in innovative digital expert solutions and services to support
growth.

The company mitigates these risks through continuous monitoring of the
market position and offerings of its businesses, the development of new
innovative products, and the provision of state-of-the-art technological
solutions to customers. The company annually invests 8-10% of total
revenues in new and enhanced product development. The company
focuses its investments on high-growth leading positions. We continue to
add value to the information we make available via content enrichment. In
addition, we explore new revenue models around open access and benefit
from search optimization programs to create revenues via public search
engines.

Corporate Governance and Risk Management

Risk description and impact

Long-term developments
Technological, cultural, or
demographic developments might
affect current business models.
These developments could for
example include disruptive
technologies, such as the impact of
artificial intelligence on the
activities of professionals. In
addition, new generations of
professional customers might expect
a different approach and different
tools and solutions to support them
in their daily activities.

Mergers and acquisitions
Risks with respect to acquisitions
primarily relate to the integration of
the acquired companies, changing
economic circumstances, customer
retention, competitive dynamics,
retaining of key personnel, and the
ability to realize expected sales and
synergies.

Divestments
Execution of the company’s strategy
is also supported by the divestment
of non-core activities. The ability to
successfully divest operations can
depend on economic and market
circumstances, competitive
dynamics, contractual obligations,
shared costs within the group, the
ability of the business to operate
stand-alone, retention of key
personnel, the buyer’s ability to
realize synergies, and other factors.

Wolters Kluwer    2017 Annual Report

Mitigation

The company actively monitors relevant trends in the markets it operates
in and general trends which might affect its business in the future.
Examples are technological developments which could impact the
professional market in the future, as well as changing customer demands
due to IT and demographic developments. The company manages
potential risks in these areas and aims to benefit from potential changes
by focusing on innovation, and through the continuing transformation
towards a global organization delivering expert solutions which combine
expertise with technology and tools. Maintaining a diverse workforce,
with good understanding of current and future customer needs, also
contributes to safeguarding future value creation by the company.

When acquiring new businesses, Wolters Kluwer carries out a
comprehensive due diligence process using internal and external
expertise. Besides indemnities and warranties, the company also
assesses whether risks can be mitigated through deal structures, such as
earn-out agreements to retain management and to assure alignment
between the purchase price and the performance of the acquired
company. Wolters Kluwer has strict strategic and financial criteria for
acquiring new businesses and is very selective in where and how to invest.
Generally, acquisitions are expected to be accretive to adjusted earnings
per share in year one and cover the company’s weighted average cost of
capital within three to five years. Wolters Kluwer has developed
repeatable post-merger integration plans and an acquisition integration
plan is agreed to by the Executive Board prior to completing an
acquisition. Such plans are actively managed and monitored after
completion.

To mitigate risks related to material divestments, the company usually
carries out a vendor due diligence and engages external experts for such
due diligence and execution of the transaction.

IT and cybersecurity
Wolters Kluwer is exposed to
IT-related risks and cyber threats
which could affect our IT
infrastructure and system
availability, applications, data, and
information. Wolters Kluwer is also
faced by changing legislation,
including laws and regulations
regarding data protection and
privacy, which can apply or relate to
the company, its customers, and
employees.

Mitigation

Wolters Kluwer takes active steps to reduce cyber risks by continuously
improving cybersecurity measures. Building on the investments since
early 2016, a new governance model was established to secure execution
of the plans, management attention, and accountability at various levels
of the organization. In 2017, Wolters Kluwer continued to transform and
improve its cybersecurity posture. The efforts are focused on the
following categories:
• Application security;
• Infrastructure security;
• Endpoint device security;
• Global vulnerability management;
• Policy and standard measures; and
• Compliance and assurance.
The business units and Global Business Services organization work to
continually identify critical applications and providers. We are bolstering
business continuity and enterprise incident management plans, and are
working to further strengthen IT disaster recovery and cyber incident
response and reporting plans, for the main operations, to mitigate the
impact of those risks. A worldwide training program consisting of online
modules was rolled out in 2017. In addition, the company updated its
Acceptable Use Policy and Global Information Security Policy in 2017.
IT General Controls form an integral part of Wolters Kluwer’s Internal
Control Framework and are aligned with the Global Information Security
Policy. Controls over data and security programs are tested regularly to
ensure that personal data are adequately protected.
The company will continue to strengthen its security and incident
response plans throughout 2018. IT and cybersecurity are standing

Supply chain, technological
developments, and projects
Our businesses could be adversely
affected by the dependency on our
supply chain, including but not
limited to parties delivering
outsourced and offshored data
center services, software
development, and maintenance
activities, including back-office
transactions processing.
Implementing new technologyrelated initiatives for delivering
Wolters Kluwer’s products and
services, as well as achieving cost
efficiencies through technology/IT
sourcing initiatives, is inherently
complex and is subjected to many
execution risks during the
development and implementation
phases.

People and organization
The success of the company is highly
dependent on its ability to attract
and retain the appropriate level of
talent.

Wolters Kluwer    2017 Annual Report

Mitigation

To manage supply chain risks, obligations are expected to be governed by
strong selection criteria when choosing outside partners, and by detailed
operating and service agreements with these outside providers and solid
monitoring of these agreements. Additionally, oversight boards and
program management teams monitor the progress and performance of
vendors during the term of these agreements. Loss prevention and
assurance programs are also increasingly focused on supply chain. Also,
major suppliers are requested to sign the Wolters Kluwer Supplier Code of
Conduct and provide relevant certifications, including ISO 27001. In the
Supplier Code of Conduct Wolters Kluwer encourages its suppliers to
implement management systems and Wolters Kluwer may verify
compliance with the standards in the Wolters Kluwer Supplier Code of
Conduct by carrying out an audit.
A roadmap for consolidation and simplification of IT infrastructure and for
implementing more service capabilities to support customers in the cloud
has been set over the past years. This includes vendor rationalization,
preferred financial and legal partnerships, and de-risking of the vendor
portfolio. In addition, the company has refined the strategy for IT backoffice operations to ensure more effective management of all back-office
systems. The company strives to continuously improve and streamline its
IT environment and infrastructure.
The Corporate Quality Assurance team aims to improve the success of
large change initiatives by providing assurance that the key projects/
programs can move to the next stage of development or implementation,
and by transferring lessons learned from one project/program to another.
This group also supports standardization of change methodologies and
frameworks.

The company ensures its ability to attract the appropriate level of talent
through a combination of competitive rewards, including market-based
remuneration, pay for performance with incentives where possible,
aligned with individual and company achievements, and benefits
benchmarked against local markets. Through formal talent management
programs that incorporate succession planning, company-sponsored
learning programs, tuition refund at external universities, and
consistently applied performance appraisal systems the company
mitigates the loss of personnel. Retention is also strengthened by
offering opportunities within the company facilitated through job posting
programs. HR executives also monitor employee turnover across different
categories very closely, including performing structured exit interviews
and identification of key drivers for leaving. The company periodically
performs surveys among its employees, giving the company a better
insight in the level of engagement of its employees and enabling it to take
steps to improve this.

Wolters Kluwer

Corporate Governance and Risk Management

2017 Annual Report

Risk description and impact

Fraud
In the conduct of its business, the
company may be exposed to internal
or external fraudulent actions.

Brand and reputation
With the increasing prominence of
the Wolters Kluwer brand, the
company potentially becomes more
vulnerable for brand or reputation
risks.

Mitigation

Measures to mitigate the risks related to fraud include the Internal
Control Framework, strict policies on segregation of duties, risk-based
internal audits, staff training, and information sharing. Since 2016, a task
force of the Corporate Risk Committee examines the risk of being exposed
to fraudulent actions and is continually implementing measures to further
reduce this exposure. In 2017, Wolters Kluwer has started to improve
processes and procedures to mitigate risk and prompt employee
awareness across the board. The new SpeakUp misconduct reporting
system implemented in 2017 is an additional measure which can
contribute to fraud prevention and detection. In 2018, we will roll out a
global fraud awareness campaign. Fraud is a standing Corporate Risk
Committee topic.

The Global Brand Organization Management Committee oversees all
brand-related topics. The Global Branding & Communications team works
closely with other corporate functions and the businesses to monitor and
control brand and reputational risks. To strengthen our ability to manage
crises and incidents, which could affect the company’s reputation, Wolters
Kluwer established a Global Incident Management Organization in 2017,
enhancing the coordination among all our divisional and functional teams.
This includes procedures to manage crises and incidents. The new
procedures ensure we are prepared and organized to respond to a
potential crisis in a timely, accurate, and relevant manner.

Legal & compliance risks

Regulatory compliance
The company can be exposed to
non-compliance with laws,
regulations, or internal policies.
Non-compliance could potentially
result in fines, restrictions to carry
out certain activities, third-party
claims, and reputational damage.

Compliance is part of the Wolters Kluwer Internal Control Framework, for
example through quarterly Letters of Representation, annual internal
control testing, and internal audits. Furthermore, several employee
training programs are currently in place to create awareness about
compliance subjects. The training programs provide employees with
knowledge to recognize potential violations or non-compliance with laws,
regulations, or internal policies, so that non-compliance can be avoided.
In 2017, we implemented SpeakUp, a global reporting system allowing
employees to report on any suspected non-compliance on a confidential
basis and if desired, anonymously. In January 2018, the company
appointed a Chief Compliance Officer, who will work with the Compliance
Committee to coordinate and optimize the company’s compliance
program and initiatives. We monitor whether legislative changes require
additional compliance efforts. In 2017, the company actively worked on
the implementation of a compliance program for the new European
General Data Protection Regulation that will come into force on May 25,
2018. These efforts will continue through 2018.

Corporate Governance and Risk Management

Risk description and impact

Corruption and bribery
Wolters Kluwer businesses operate
worldwide, which brings a high
variety of business cultures and
practices. In addition, our customers
include governmental and semigovernmental organizations. These
are factors which could potentially
contribute to the risk of being
exposed to corruption and bribery.

Contractual compliance
The company could be exposed to
claims by its contractual
counterparties based on alleged
non-compliance of contractual
terms, such as the number of users
agreed upon (available licenses),
price commitments, or services to be
delivered.

Intellectual property protection
Intellectual property rights could be
challenged, limited, invalidated,
circumvented, or infringed.
Technological developments make it
increasingly difficult to protect
intellectual property rights. Changes
in legislation could have an impact
on the ability to protect intellectual
property rights.

Third-party claims
The company may be exposed to
claims (including class actions or
mass tort) by third parties relating to
products, services (including
software or SaaS offerings), or
informational content provided or
published by the company. Such
claims may be based on legal
theories such as alleged negligence,
product liability, breach of contract,
or infringement of third-party
intellectual property rights.

Wolters Kluwer    2017 Annual Report

Mitigation

Wolters Kluwer’s policies prohibit employees, either directly or indirectly,
from offering, promising, demanding, or accepting bribes to obtain or
retain business. Furthermore, the company has rules on accepting and
offering gifts and hospitality. All employees globally are made aware of
these rules through the annual compliance training, and new employees
upon their onboarding at Wolters Kluwer. The company requires the same
from its suppliers through the Wolters Kluwer Supplier Code of Conduct,
and, in addition, asks its suppliers to provide any available anti-bribery
certifications, including ISO 37001. With our global misconduct reporting
system (SpeakUp), the company encourages its employees to report on
any suspected act of corruption or bribery in their own language and if
desired, anonymously.

The company manages contractual risks by negotiating contracts with
attention to risk transfer clauses. For part of its contracts, the company
uses contract management systems to monitor material contractual
rights and obligations, and software tools to track the use of software for
which licenses are required.

Wolters Kluwer actively protects its intellectual property rights, which is
important to safeguard its portfolio of information, software solutions,
and services. The company relies on trademark, copyright, patent, and
other intellectual property laws to establish and protect its proprietary
rights to these products and services. We closely monitor legislative
developments with respect to intellectual property rights.

Wolters Kluwer manages and transfers these risks by striving to produce
high quality products, services, and content, and by including customary
and appropriate disclaimers and limitations of liability in its contracts.
Furthermore, the company expects its employees to strictly comply with
intellectual property laws and regulations.
The company’s insurance program may cover certain types of claims
exposures. The company manages a range of insurable risks by arranging
for insurance coverage for first-party and third-party liability exposures.

Property damage and business
interruption
The company could be exposed to
damages to its facilities and IT
systems, which could cause business
interruption.

Legislative developments

Mitigation

To mitigate specifically against property damage and business
interruption risks, the company has implemented a centralized worldwide
risk control and business continuity management program. Accompanied
by insurers, company risk managers perform regular loss control visits at
key operating company and supplier locations working with our operating
companies to cost-effectively implement recommendations for continued
improvement. In 2017, Wolters Kluwer established a Global Incident
Management Organization to strengthen its ability to manage crises and
incidents. Incident management is a standing topic of the Corporate Risk
Committee and incidents are reported quarterly to the Audit Committee.

The company carefully monitors legislative developments. In emerging
countries, the company often partners with local companies.

As a global information, software
solutions, and services provider,
changes in laws, legislation, or
(temporary) trade restrictions could
impact the company’s business in
certain jurisdictions. Certain
countries could impose restrictions
on ownership of publishing activities
by foreign companies.

Financial risks

Treasury
Fluctuations in exchange and
interest rates affect Wolters Kluwer’s
results.

It is the company’s goal to mitigate the effects of currency and interest
rate movements on net profit, equity, and cash flow. Whenever possible,
the company tries to do this by creating natural hedges, by matching the
currency profile of income and expenses and of assets and liabilities.
When natural hedges are not present, Wolters Kluwer strives to realize the
same effect with the aid of derivative financial instruments. For this
purpose, hedging ranges have been identified and policies and
governance are in place, including authorization procedures and limits.
The company only purchases or holds derivative financial instruments
with the aim of mitigating risks and most of these instruments qualify for
hedge accounting as defined in IAS 39. The company does not purchase or
hold derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. In line
with IFRS requirements, detailed information on financial risks and
policies is provided in Note 27 – Financial Risk Management. The Treasury
Policy on market (currency and interest), liquidity, and credit risks is
reviewed by the Audit Committee, with quarterly reporting by the Treasury
Committee to the Audit Committee on the status of these financial risks.

Corporate Governance and Risk Management

Risk description and impact

Post-employment benefits
The company maintains a number of
post-employment benefit programs
globally. Generally, these programs
are defined contribution or defined
benefit plans, some of which are
active and some are closed. The
largest of these plans are in the
Netherlands, the United States, the
United Kingdom, Canada, Belgium,
and Australia. For most of the active
plans, the company as well as
employees make investments for the
future benefit of participants. For the
closed plans, the company continues
to ensure they are properly funded
to provide the committed level of
benefits to participants. From a risk
point of view, funding requirements
are influenced by the investment
returns on the assets invested in
each respective plan, which are
influenced by financial markets and
economic conditions.

Taxes
Changes in operational taxes and
corporate income tax rates, laws and
regulations could adversely affect
the company’s financial results, tax
assets, and liabilities

Wolters Kluwer    2017 Annual Report

Mitigation

Our approach to managing risks to the company includes ongoing
evaluation of all plans to ensure we are market competitive with designs
that minimize risk and volatility. As a result, we have taken steps, such as
moving our closed retiree medical plan in the United States to a private
exchange, which eliminated the liability and the financial risk of the
program, developing exit strategies for closed defined benefit plans
starting with the United States where we have reduced the number of
participants and therefore the company’s liability through a costeffective lump sum distribution initiative. We are also closely managing
our investment strategy to see stronger asset returns with hedging
parameters to manage downside risk. To support our agenda to fulfill our
commitments to participants in the most efficient way for the company,
we partner with independent expert advisors on market competitive plan
design, plan performance monitoring, and defining investment and
hedging strategies for all of our plans. The accounting for postemployment benefit plans is based on annual actuarial calculations.

Most taxes are either transactional or employee-related and are levied
from the legal entities in the relevant jurisdictions.
Wolters Kluwer maintains a liability for certain contingencies in line with
IFRS accounting standards. The adequacy of this liability is judged on a
regular basis in consultation with external advisors. Reference is made to
Note 21 – Tax Assets and Liabilities for additional information about
corporate income tax and related risks. As a leader in Tax & Accounting
products, the company takes its responsibility as a corporate citizen
seriously. The company reviews its Tax Principles annually and updates
them where necessary. The most recent update took place in 2016. These
principles are published on www.wolterskluwer.com.

reasonable under the circumstances.
Actual results may differ from those
estimates.

Mitigation

The company mitigates these risks by maintaining an Internal Control
Framework for financial reporting as described in the introduction to this
section. In addition, senior executives in the divisional and operating
companies and senior corporate staff members provide signed Letters of
Representation quarterly in which they certify compliance with laws and
policies. Independent internal audits are also carried out to ensure
compliance with policies and procedures and ensure that existing
controls provide adequate protection against actual risks. In addition,
employees and senior executives are expected to report any suspected
non-compliance in financial reporting via the new global misconduct
reporting system SpeakUp.

met.

The group recognizes gains and losses on the settlement
of a defined benefit plan when the settlement occurs. A
curtailment occurs when an entity significantly reduces
the number of employees covered by a plan. A curtailment
may arise from an isolated event, such as disposal or
restructuring, discontinuance of an operation or
termination and suspension of a plan. Amendments to the
terms of a defined benefit plan will be considered plan
amendments and will be fully accounted for as past
service costs.
Long-term service benefits
The group’s net obligation in respect of long-term service
benefits, such as jubilee benefits, is the amount of future
benefits that employees have earned in return for their
service in the current and prior periods. The obligation is
calculated using the projected unit credit method and is
discounted to its present value, and the fair value of any
related assets is deducted.
The group recognizes all remeasurement gains and losses
arising from defined benefit plans immediately in the
period in which they occur in other comprehensive
income. All expenses related to defined benefit plans are
presented in the statement of profit or loss.
Termination benefits
Termination benefits are recognized as an expense when
the group is demonstrably committed - without realistic
possibility of withdrawal - to a formal detailed plan to
either terminate employment before the normal
retirement date, or to provide termination benefits as
result of an offer made to encourage voluntary
redundancy.

Key Audit Matter

Valuation of goodwill and acquired identifiable
intangible assets
The group has € 3,750 million of goodwill and
€ 1,322 million of acquired identifiable intangible
assets (December 31, 2016: € 4,085 million and
€ 1,437 million respectively), as disclosed in Note 17 –
Goodwill and Intangible Assets. Goodwill and acquired
identifiable intangible assets represent 59.8% of total
assets and 218.2% of equity. Goodwill is subject to an
annual impairment test.
The value-in-use of goodwill and acquired identifiable
intangible assets is dependent on expected future cash
flows from the underlying group Cash Generating Units
(CGUs) for goodwill and individual CGUs for acquired
identifiable intangible assets. The impairment
assessment prepared by management includes a
variety of internal and external factors, which
represents significant estimates that require the use of
valuation models and a significant level of management
judgment, particularly the assumptions related to the
weighted average cost of capital and the perpetual
growth rates.

How the key audit matter was addressed in the audit

We obtained an understanding of the process in place
and identified controls in the impairment assessment
of Wolters Kluwer N.V. for goodwill and acquired
identifiable intangible assets.
We obtained management’s impairment assessment
and have evaluated the impairment models. We
involved valuation specialists to assess the models
used and the key assumptions applied as outlined in
Note 17 – Goodwill and Intangible Assets.
We challenged management’s key assumptions used for
cash flow projections, weighted average cost of capital,
and perpetual growth rates. We compared rates in use
with historical trends and external data and performed
sensitivity analyses. We reconciled forecasted cash
flows per group CGU to authorized budgets and
obtained an understanding how these budgets were
compiled.
Our valuation specialists assisted us in challenging the
discount rates, future growth rates, and other rates
applied by benchmarking against independent data.
We also evaluated the adequacy of the disclosures
provided by the group in Note 17 – Goodwill and
Intangible Assets in relation to its impairment
assessment.

Acquisition accounting for significant new business
combinations
During the year ended December 31, 2017, the group
made a number of acquisitions as detailed in Note 7 –
Acquisitions and Divestments. The most significant
acquisition was Tagetik for a total consideration of €291
million. Also management reassessed the preliminary
purchase price adjustments that were prepared for the
2016 acquisitions.
The company assessed, with the assistance of thirdparty valuation specialists, the fair value of identifiable
assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquiree.
The determination and recognition of the fair value of
the acquired identifiable intangible assets required
significant management judgment. The critical
accounting judgment in respect to the identification of
acquired identifiable intangible assets is disclosed in
Note 7 – Acquisitions and Divestments.
Completeness of assets and liabilities identified in
relation to the fair value adjustments applied to the
book values of other assets acquired requires careful
consideration including due diligences.
Further information with respect to completed and
preliminary purchase price allocations is described in
Note 7 – Acquisitions and Divestments.

Revenue recognition
Revenue (transactions) may be subject to manual
adjustments for open-end contracts at balance sheet
date. There is a risk of material misstatement that
these revenue transactions are based on non-valid,
inaccurate, and improper period allocation manual
journal entries. The company’s revenue recognition
policies are disclosed in Note 3 – Accounting Estimates
and Judgments.
Significant new and amended revenue may also require
careful consideration and judgment in determining the
correct revenue recognition pattern in accordance with
IAS 18.
The company may fail to defer revenue recognition in
accordance with IAS 18 requirements associated with
significant new and amended revenue arrangements.

Other Information on the Financial Statements

How the key audit matter was addressed in the audit

We have considered the main processes and
procedures in place at Wolters Kluwer N.V. for
acquisitions. We assessed and evaluated for material
business combinations the share purchase agreements
and challenged the acquisition accounting assessments
made by management with the assistance of thirdparty valuation specialists.
Our audit procedures included the involvement of
internal valuation specialists to assess the
appropriateness of the methodology applied by
management in determining the fair valuation of
acquired identifiable intangible assets and other
assets and liabilities acquired. Key assumptions
challenged were discount rates, (terminal) growth
rates, cash flow projections, net assets acquired, and
useful lives assigned.
We also assessed the completeness of the fair value
adjustments recognized by reading e.g. sale and
purchase agreements, board papers, and due diligence
reports.
We challenged and evaluated adjustments made to
preliminary purchase price allocations made during
prior year including the required disclosures.
We also evaluated the adequacy of the disclosures
provided by the group in Note 7 – Acquisitions and
Divestments in relation to its acquisitions.

The revenue recognition testing procedures performed
on existing contracts was focused on manual
adjustments, which could impact the accuracy,
occurrence, and cut-off of recorded revenue especially
around period-end. We considered controls and
segregation of duties in place deemed relevant to our
audit. Analytical reviews were performed by segment,
product category and geographical location. Manual
entries made were challenged with authorized source
documents like contracts, third-party delivery
confirmations, and customer acceptance forms.
Component auditors were involved in assessing the
accounting methodologies and revenue recognition
policies applied for significant new and amended
contracts. Revenue and deferred income were
challenged for recognition in accordance with the
underlying contract, agreement, acceptance, usage or
delivery form. We further evaluated the adequacy of
the company’s revenue recognition policies and
revenue disclosures as included in the consolidated
financial statements in Note 3 – Accounting Estimates
and Judgments.

Accounting for complex current and deferred income
taxes (including uncertain tax positions)
The company, due to its international and decentralized
operating model, has a complex tax structure, mainly in
the U.S. and Europe.
The tax positions taken in the various income tax
returns are subject to periodic challenges by local tax
authorities. Insufficient understanding of the local
requirements may result in tax positions that are not
supported by local laws and regulations. The
assessment process of these current and deferred
income tax balances is complex and requires careful
consideration and judgment.
The current and deferred tax positions, including
uncertain tax positions, are disclosed in Note 21 – Tax
Assets and Liabilities.

Wolters Kluwer    2017 Annual Report

How the key audit matter was addressed in the audit

We involved our tax specialists to obtain an
understanding of the company’s tax strategy, including
current transfer pricing arrangements, royalty
agreements and other agreements. We considered
controls and segregation of duties in place relevant to
the assessments made by management in determining
current and deferred income tax positions and adopted
a substantive audit approach.
We analysed the accounted permanent and temporary
differences, (potential) tax risks, legislative
developments and the status of ongoing local tax
authority audits. We challenged the company’s
positions by independently testing assumptions and
estimates in use with correspondence from e.g. tax
authorities, historical track records, and tax opinions.
Our audit procedures included the involvement of tax
specialists to assess the appropriateness of deferred
and uncertain tax positions.
Contingencies were evaluated for triggers that could
result in provisions for uncertain tax positions and vice
versa. New positions taken were evaluated and
discussed with tax experts on compliance with local
laws and regulations and substance requirements.
We also evaluated the adequacy of the disclosure on
the current and deferred tax positions as included in
Note 21 – Tax Assets and Liabilities.

Internal controls over financial reporting
The company has its businesses in a large number of
countries and locations. The company operates various
IT systems, processes and procedures locally that are
important for the continuity of its business operations
and for the reliability of its financial reporting.

We have considered the company’s internal controls
over financial reporting as a basis for designing and
performing the audit activities that are deemed
appropriate for our audit. We are, however, not required
to perform an audit on internal controls over financial
reporting and accordingly we do not express an opinion
on the effectiveness of the company’s controls over
financial reporting.
We have tailored our audit procedures to the diverse
(local) IT landscapes and the implemented internal
controls. We have included specialized IT auditors in
our audit teams to test the reliability and continuity of
the automated data processing, solely to the extent
necessary within the scope of the financial statement
audit. Where relevant for the audit we have tested the
operating effectiveness of (IT) controls and performed
additional audit procedures where deemed needed.
We refer to Risk Management, where the Internal
Control Framework for financial reporting is described.

shares outstanding.
Adjusted EBITDA
EBITDA adjusted for non-benchmark
items in operating profit.
Adjusted net financing results

the after-tax effect of nonbenchmark items, amortization of
acquired identifiable intangible
assets, and impairments of goodwill

property, plant, and equipment and
other intangible assets less any
carrying value of assets disposed of.
Cash flow: cash conversion ratio

Continuing operations
The results of the group, excluding
the results of those components that
have been presented as discontinued
operations.
Diluted adjusted earnings per share
Adjusted net profit divided by the
weighted average number of ordinary
shares outstanding (adjusted
earnings per share).
Shares conditionally awarded under
LTIP-plans are included in the

average number of ordinary shares
outstanding if the vesting conditions
are satisfied.

Allocated tax
Allocated tax is benchmark tax rate
multiplied by adjusted operating

the ordinary activities of the group,
and are excluded from the
benchmark figures.
Non-benchmark items in operating
profit: results from divestments of
operations (including directly
attributable divestment costs),
additions to provisions for
restructuring of stranded costs
following divestments, acquisitionrelated costs, additions to
acquisition integration provisions,
subsequent fair value changes on

previous reporting period, adjusted
for the impact of divestments of
operations above a minimum
threshold, all translated at constant
currencies.
Tax on adjusted profit
Income tax expense adjusted for tax
benefit on amortization of acquired

Forward-looking statements and other
important legal information
This report contains forward-looking statements. These
statements may be identified by words such as “expect”,
“should”, “could”, “shall” and similar expressions. Wolters
Kluwer cautions that such forward-looking statements
are qualified by certain risks and uncertainties that could
cause actual results and events to differ materially from
what is contemplated by the forward-looking statements.
Factors which could cause actual results to differ from
these forward-looking statements may include, without
limitation, general economic conditions; conditions in the
markets in which Wolters Kluwer is engaged; behavior of
customers, suppliers, and competitors; technological
developments; the implementation and execution of new
ICT systems or outsourcing; and legal, tax, and regulatory
rules affecting Wolters Kluwer’s businesses, as well as
risks related to mergers, acquisitions, and divestments. In
addition, financial risks such as currency movements,
interest rate fluctuations, liquidity, and credit risks could
influence future results. The foregoing list of factors
should not be construed as exhaustive. Wolters Kluwer
disclaims any intention or obligation to publicly update or
revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a
result of new information, future events or otherwise.
