Heineken N.V. Annual Report 2017

Chief Executive’s Statement

HEINEKEN delivered a strong performance in 2017, in spite of continued challenges in the
external environment, including geopolitical instability and volatile currencies. All of our regions
contributed to organic volume, revenue and profit growth.
We have a broad, balanced geographic footprint which provides stability from mature markets
paired with faster growth from emerging economies.
During 2017, we significantly expanded our operations in Ethiopia, Mexico, Cambodia, Vietnam
and Haiti, and we opened our first brewery in Ivory Coast.
The acquisition of Brasil Kirin makes us the second largest beer company in Brazil and better
equips us to capture future profitable growth in this exciting beer market. Another key
investment during 2017 was our acquisition of approximately 1,900 pubs from Punch Taverns,
making us the owners of the third largest pubs business in the UK.
The Heineken® brand continued to benefit from its position as a progressive and innovative
leader in the premium segment, delivering its strongest performance in recent years. As the
premium segment continues to outpace the overall beer market, the brand power of Heineken®
is more important than ever. The launch of our latest innovation, Heineken® 0.0, has been very
promising, in tune with an increasing emphasis on health and wellbeing that is driving changes
in consumer behaviour worldwide.
Our international brands portfolio volume growth, outperformed our total beer portfolio
growth for the third consecutive year. Our local brands are more relevant than ever as local
identity and provenance increasingly matters in many markets. These brands also provide
scale and route-to-market power to build our premium portfolio and new categories.
The craft & variety segment continues to be very dynamic and is a priority area for future
growth. In May 2017, we acquired the remaining stake in Lagunitas (having entered a
50/50 partnership in 2015), allowing us to accelerate the roll-out of the brand to many more
markets around the world. Our other international craft brands, Affligem and Mort Subite,
are performing strongly; and we are successful with our crafty line extensions for brands such
as Birra Moretti, Brand and Żywiec.
Heineken® 0.0, as well as our other low- and no-alcohol offerings, represent an opportunity
to access our existing base of loyal consumers who would prefer an alcohol-free drink at
times, as well as new consumers who wouldn’t otherwise drink an alcoholic beer. In 2017
we sold almost 13 million hectolitres of our low- and no-alcohol products and we see growth
opportunities in this category.
We continue to make inroads in the cider category, which allows us to reach new consumer
groups. One in four alcohol drinkers does not drink beer. Cider can provide a great alternative.
From our position as the world’s leading cider producer, we have a unique ability to help
consumers in new markets to develop an understanding of cider – what it is, when to drink
it and the heritage and authenticity that the category represents. The potential of this
global opportunity is highlighted by the double digit volume growth of our cider portfolio
delivered outside the UK during 2017.

Heineken N.V. Annual Report 2017

During the year, HEINEKEN launched new e-commerce initiatives, both Business-to-Business
and Business-to-Consumer platforms, such as Beerwulf, which is our new craft & variety online
business channel for consumers. We also continued to introduce innovations. In 2017, for
instance, we launched The Blade, a countertop draught system with 8 litre kegs that can be
ordered online by the trade.
We have a clear strategy which is aligned with our commitment to long-term value creation,
with four priorities for action: deliver top line growth, drive end2end performance, Brew a Better
World, and engage and develop our people. You can read more about each of these priorities in
more detail later in the report.
We are making good progress with our 2020 Brew a Better World commitments.
Climate change is a major societal and environmental threat. We have the responsibility
to reduce our usage of fossil fuels and to reduce our CO2 emissions, playing our part in the
commitments set by the COP21 Paris Agreement. We are setting a new ambition for 2030 to
reduce our carbon emissions through a programme called ‘Drop the C’. Our new commitments
will cover not just production, logistics and cooling, but also for the first time packaging as an
important component of our carbon footprint. Our aim is to drive an authentic transformation
to renewable energy, deliberately excluding the possibility to achieve targets through purchasing
unbundled certificates. The name ‘Drop the C’ is inspired by the idea that taking the C out of
CO2 leaves Oxygen. The play on words is also about ensuring sea levels do not continue to rise.
We strongly believe that by fully integrating sustainability into the way we do business, we are
best placed to make a meaningful impact on the world around us. As with last year, for that
very reason, this is a joint financial and sustainability report.
Looking ahead to 2018, we are committed to long-term value creation and will continue to
strive for superior top line growth whilst working on improving our operating profit margin.
For 2018, excluding major unforeseen macro economic and political developments, we expect
to deliver an operating profit margin expansion of around 25bps. This includes a residual dilutive
effect on margins from the acquisition of Brasil Kirin and excludes the one-time benefit of IFRS
15 implementation.
With a rigorous focus on our strategic priorities, and with the engagement and energy of all
of us working at HEINEKEN, I am looking forward to 2018 being another year of progress for
our business.

Our impact on society:

Our ambition is to Brew a Better World across the entire value chain, from Barley to Bar.
This shapes our contribution to delivering the UN Sustainable Development Goals which
aim to end global poverty, protect the planet and ensure prosperity.

Employees

Communities

Our journey begins and ends
with over 80,000 employees1
in more than 70 countries.

Brewing beer and making cider
is a craft. We operate more
than 170 breweries, malteries,
cider plants and other
production facilities around
the world.

From the farmers we source
from to the people living
around our breweries, we
depend on stable local
communities and we help
them prosper.

We focus on increasing energy
and water efficiency in our
production processes, and
switching to renewable energy
sources. In absolute terms, we
have reduced CO2 emissions by 7%
since 2008, despite having grown
our business volumes by 57%.
For production we have set new
targets for 2030: growing our share
of renewable energy from 14% in
2017 to 70% by 2030. We want
to enable the transition to the
circular economy. By-products
such as spent grains are used for
cattle feed, and packaging waste
is recycled into new products.
We aim for zero waste to landfill
and 97 of our production facilities
are already there.

Our biggest influence is through our
core business: in 2017, HEINEKEN
contributed almost €11 billion in
taxes4 and provided over 80,000
direct jobs. The HEINEKEN
Africa Foundation supports
projects that improve health for
people living in communities
near the breweries. Since it was
established, the Foundation
has committed €9.2 million
to 104 projects, of which 41
projects were still running in 2017.
Around the world our operating
companies donated €24 million
to community projects addressing
areas like ecosystem conservation,
culture and education.

With 64 nationalities represented
among our senior management,
cultural diversity is HEINEKEN’s
strong point. We aim to provide
equal opportunities for all and
are focused on increasing female
representation at senior levels,
which grew by 2 percentage
points to 19%. Our Code of
Business Conduct guides our
employees both inside the
Company and in their interactions
with external stakeholders.
By end of 2017, more than 75,000
employees had completed our
Code of Business Conduct training
and anti-bribery training modules
were completed almost 19,350
times. The response rate of our
2017 HEINEKEN Climate survey
was 91%. Both participation
and employee engagement
scores grew again, reflecting
consistently higher scores than
the external benchmark2.
In this way, we support SDG

Agriculture
Our beer and cider are made
from natural ingredients,
which we source with care.
More of our raw materials –
such as barley, hops and bitter
sweet apples – now come from
sustainable sources, and we aim to
reach 50% by 2020. We work with
farmers and partners to improve
crop yields and quality. In Africa,
in addition to barley, we source
other locally3 grown ingredients
including sorghum and rice for
use in our beer. This empowers
communities and improves
livelihoods for over 150,000
smallholder farmers. Our Supplier
Code sets clear standards of
responsibility for our suppliers.
In this way, we support SDG

In this way, we support SDG

Distribution

Packaging
HEINEKEN drinks come
in bottles, cans and kegs,
all of which have an impact
on the environment.
We have a strong focus on
packaging because it is an
area where we still have a
lot to get done: optimising
production, changing design
and increasing our recycling
and re-use rates. We are in
conversation with our packaging
suppliers to reduce the amount
of energy used in producing our
packaging materials.

The majority of our products
are produced in the countries
where they are consumed,
which limits the environmental
impacts of transport.
But we continue to carefully
manage our movement of
supplies and products. We are
on track to reduce our emissions
from distribution in Europe and
the Americas. The safety of our
employees and contractors is,
and always will be, a key priority.
In this way, we support SDG

Consumers

Customers
Our brands are purchased and
consumed in bars, restaurants
and via retailers around the
world. Because our products
are best served cooled,
reducing emissions from
refrigeration is a high priority.
In 2017, we invested in almost
138,000 green fridges to help
customers reduce emissions.
Our draught system innovations
are reducing water, energy and
waste when our drinks are sold.
We believe our products should
only be sold to consumers of legal
drinking age and we encourage
our customers to promote
responsible consumption and
reduce harmful drinking.

Every day, millions of
consumers choose to enjoy one
of our more than 300 brands.
We provide choice through our
premium portfolio approach.
Innovations, especially in the lowand no-alcohol categories, are
meeting evolving consumer tastes.
We used our global partnership
with Formula 1® to launch a major
new campaign, ‘When You Drive,
Never Drink’. The majority of our
operating companies invested
more than 10% of their media
spend for Heineken® in activities
related to responsible drinking
campaigns and our target is for
all markets around the world.
44 of our operating companies
have local partnerships in place
to address alcohol-related harm.

Our business priorities (continued)

Deliver top line growth

In 2017, we made good progress in building and leading the
premium segment, led by Heineken® and supported by our portfolio
of international and local brands, alongside our focus on
craft & variety, low- and no-alcohol and cider category growth.
Our strategy is to lead the premium segment
in beer and cider across the world and leverage
the brand power of Heineken®, supported by a
strong portfolio of international premium and
local brands. As beer remains a local business,
our goal is to be the number one, or a strong
number two, in the markets where we compete
with a full brand portfolio. We will also continue
our focus on growing and leading the craft &
variety, low- and no-alcohol and cider categories,
which is becoming more important as we drive
additional customer penetration and target
more households.
In 2017, Heineken® volumes grew 4.5% showing
one of its strongest performances in recent years.
Our international brands portfolio continued to be
a strong driver of volume and premium revenue
growth. The portfolio represents all corners of the
globe and includes Amstel (which is now available
in over 100 markets), Desperados, Sol, Tiger, Tecate,
Red Stripe, Krušovice and Birra Moretti.
The rise of the craft & variety segment continues to
gain momentum as more people want to explore the
taste of beer. Craft & variety is an important emerging
category within HEINEKEN that complements the
growing international premium beer segment.
We continue to innovate with products including nonalcoholic beer, low-alcoholic beer, Radlers, nourishing dark
malts and refreshing light malts. We launched Heineken®
0.0 during the Formula 1® Grand Prix in Barcelona
and it is now available in 16 markets – a clear sign of
commitment to the category. Our low- and no-alcohol
portfolio showed consistent double digit volume
growth in Europe.

International brands

Our international brands portfolio
strengthens our presence in the premium
segment by tapping into consumer
appetite for diversity, unique stories,
purpose, and new brand experiences.
In 2017, for instance we created the world’s
first electronic orchestra in hot air balloons
with Desperados SkyFest.

Heineken®

With a presence in more than
190 markets, Heineken® is the world’s
most international beer brand.

Craft & variety

Consumers around the world are
seeking more choice and taste variety,
and it is important we have the right
brands available as consumers navigate
through a greater assortment of beer
styles. We have an attractive portfolio
of local craft line extensions such as
Brand IPA and Birra Moretti Regionale,
international craft brands that can
travel – Lagunitas, Affligem and Mort
Subite and selectively acquired local craft
breweries, for example HIBU in Italy and
Tuatara in New Zealand.

Low- and no-alcohol

Our low- and no-alcohol category is
benefiting from consumer trends towards
alcohol moderation, naturalness and
health consciousness. We have a growing
portfolio in the category made up of
distinct products. Our latest innovation
in this category is Heineken® 0.0.

We are capturing the cider opportunity and growing
the category. Our cider brand portfolio expanded to
over 50 markets. Consumer trends play well to the
strength of cider, with its unisex appeal, naturalness,
authenticity, range of different flavours and sweeter
taste. We continued to shape the cider portfolio led by
Strongbow Apple Ciders, as well as Orchard Thieves, Blind
Pig, Old Mout, Stassen and Bulmers. Consolidated cider
volume increased low single digit to reach 4.9 million
hectolitres (2016: 4.8 million hectolitres).
E-commerce and innovations continued to be important
for us. In 2017, we launched Beerwulf which is our new
craft & variety online business channel for consumers.
We also introduced The Blade, a countertop draught
system with 8 litre kegs that can be ordered online
for bars or smaller restaurants that traditionally only
sell bottles.

Global cider portfolio

We are the world’s biggest cider producer.
Around the world, a growing number of
consumers are discovering the appeal
of cider. HEINEKEN is shaping the cider
category with our portfolio of global and
local cider brands.

performance will fuel future growth and increase our margins.

Our end2end perspective starts with our
consumers and customers and focuses on
reducing non-value adding costs. Our strategy
encompasses disciplined management of capital
expenditure and working capital and a drive for
functional efficiency. This means simplifying
processes and eliminating duplication. As a
global business we need to continue to realise
the full benefit of our scale.
In 2017, we continued to invest in key developing
markets. We added capacity in Ivory Coast and
Vietnam and we started construction to extend our
Kilinto brewery in Ethiopia. We are on schedule to
open our brand new Meoqui brewery in Mexico in
early 2018. We also laid the foundation stone of our
first HEINEKEN brewery in Mozambique. The first
bottle of beer is expected to come off the production
line in the first half of 2019.
In procurement, we continue to leverage HEINEKEN’s
global scale with fewer, more strategic suppliers,
supporting both top and bottom line growth.
With this strategy, we have continued to reduce our
cost base as well as leveraging our supplier financing
tools and delivering cash benefits.
Applying continuous improvement to our New
Product Implementation (NPI) process allows us
to introduce more new products faster and more
efficiently. Our Sales and Operational Planning Process
capabilities are instrumental for matching supply
versus demand and anticipating increasing market
volatility. Through our Commercial Spend Productivity
(CSP) initiative, we continued to focus on investing
our commercial resources in the most efficient and
effective way.

Integration of Brasil Kirin
into HEINEKEN Brazil

By using an end2end approach for the
integration of Brasil Kirin, procurement,
production and logistics played
an instrumental role in identifying
the synergies and optimising the
supplier networks, contributing to
a successful integration.

Global supply chain

64% of our beverage production sites
reduced energy consumption and 63%
reduced water consumption in 2017.

HEINEKEN Financial Shared
Services centre (HFSS)

In 2017, we continued to work end2end
to achieve process improvements and
seamless operations between HFSS and
the countries.

We made good progress on our BASE programme,
which enables HEINEKEN to become more agile and
efficient by standardising core business processes
in Finance, Procurement, Production, Logistics and
Sales supported by Enterprise Resource Planning
(ERP) systems. Over the coming three years we plan
to deploy BASE in various regions and territories: Asia
Pacific, Africa, Middle East & Eastern Europe and
the Caribbean.
Taken together, these efforts to improve our
productivity contribute to increase our margins
and fuel future growth.

Media waves project

By aligning the commercial and
procurement agendas, we have
supported our Win with Brands strategy
through the consolidation of the media
spend into two global competitive
partners. This allows us to build a
sustainable relationship with our media
partners whilst maximising our reach to
the global consumers.

Our business priorities (continued)

Brew a Better World

We believe that sustainability can help drive business success, and that
business can be a positive force for change. To achieve this we embed
sustainability within our business strategy and priorities.

We have made good progress towards achieving
our 2020 commitments but we need to do more
in some areas.

Green Corridor

HEINEKEN, Nedcargo and the Port of
Rotterdam Authority are taking steps
towards a ‘green corridor’. Together with
other parties, we want to make the
logistic activities between Alphen aan
den Rijn and the port of Rotterdam
climate neutral.

We are setting our sights beyond 2020 as we
begin to raise our ambitions for the future. Our new
transformational programme ‘Drop the C’ will significantly
reduce carbon emissions from across the business. It is
a challenging plan with ambitious targets for 2030
that will require open collaboration and game-changing
innovation from players covering the entire value chain.
In 2018 we will start a similar exercise for our water
ambitions beyond 2020, called ‘Every Drop’.
We increased our efforts to make responsible
consumption cool – extending our commitment of
10% media spend for Heineken® responsible drinking
advertising from 14 operating companies to all
consolidated companies1 selling Heineken®. We also
continued to innovate in the no-alcohol category with
the successful launch of Heineken® 0.0, offering a
great tasting, natural product without alcohol and
with less calories.
We reduced once again our accident frequency, but
were deeply saddened that 14 people lost their lives
while working within the HEINEKEN Company in
2017. Based on pilots in seven operating companies,
we decided to make telematics mandatory for all
Company-operated vehicles to monitor and improve
safe driving behaviour.

Stop and think

View
case
study
online

10% of Heineken® media spend is on
ads that actively promote moderation.
The ads often show people choosing not
to drink our beer. A bold move for a beer
brand. But by being bold, we are making
people stop and think.

Tiger helping Tigers

Staying true to its name, Tiger Beer
embarked on an ambitious six-year
global partnership with the WWF
network to create a global movement
and help double the number of wild
tigers by 2022.

Brewing a Better World continues to inspire our brands,
like Tiger and Tecate, to align their purpose with some of
the big issues affecting society. The Heineken® Worlds
Apart campaign in the UK used the power of our global
brand to inspire positive social change. At a time when
people feel openness and tolerance in society is under
threat, our social experiment resonated with millions
of people – not just in the UK but worldwide.
As we continue our journey to embed Brewing
a Better World in the business agenda, we are
engaging our leaders through the introduction of a
balanced scorecard that will better monitor and drive
performance across our non-financial indicators.
We particularly value our ongoing collaboration and
dialogue with stakeholders – including NGOs, investors,
government ministries and many others. They help us
to learn and improve our approach around key issues
such as human rights and environmental protection.
We will continue this dialogue in developing our
sustainability actions beyond 2020, helping to achieve
the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

performance, please turn to the Sustainability Review on page 133.

Our business priorities (continued)

Engage and develop our people
Two of our most important differentiators and competitive
advantages are, and always have been, our people and our culture.
To achieve our ambition of being a proud and independent global
brewer committed to long-term value creation, engaging and
developing our people will remain critical.
We believe the engagement, capability and
diversity of all our people drives our continued
success. This business priority has four elements:
Develop great business driven leaders, Grow
our talent pipeline at all levels, Build critical
capabilities and strengthen functional excellence,
and Leverage diversity and our culture.
We focus on developing great business-driven leaders,
because we know that how we lead drives our business
performance and shapes our culture. Our Leadership
Expectations – introduced in 2017 and embedded
in all of our key people processes – equip our leaders
with a common understanding of what is expected of
them in their roles, and provide a simple framework to
guide their ongoing development.
To be successful today and in the future, we have to
ensure that our talent management approach is aligned
with the business strategy and that we are attracting,
identifying, developing, engaging and retaining the
best talent at all levels. We are making solid progress in
this agenda and there is increasing ownership of talent
management by business leaders.

HIMAC

Our flagship two week development
programme for senior top talents, the
HEINEKEN International Management
Course (HIMAC), explores our key
strategic and leadership challenges.
Members of our Executive Team play an
active part in the delivery. Last year it was
delivered in partnership with INSEAD
Business School. 44 high potential
leaders from across HEINEKEN attended.

Leadership Expectations

Wherever we operate, we identify and develop the
critical strategic capabilities to win in the market place.
This includes building capability for operating in an
increasingly ‘digital’ world. We focus our investments
on developing these critical capabilities and, at the
same time, strengthening our functional excellence
in a practical and disciplined way whether it is in
marketing, sales, production, finance, or other areas.
We know that our diversity across HEINEKEN can
be a big driver of innovation, creativity and business
success. This includes nationality, experiences,
thinking styles and also gender where progress still
needs to be made. To enable this we are driving the
implementation of our Inclusion & Diversity strategy
and action plan (see page 147).
We have a unique and compelling culture, reflected
in ‘We are HEINEKEN’ which we launched last year.
Our annual Climate Survey is a key barometer for
how we are doing on culture and engagement and,
in 2017, we again achieved excellent engagement
scores, placing us in the top quartile of companies
against the external benchmark1.
Workplace by Facebook is our new internal digital
engagement platform. It connects colleagues
globally and is already enabling faster, more engaging
sharing of information, stories and learning among
HEINEKEN colleagues around the world.
1

IBM external norm.

BOOST

To be successful today and in the future,
we need to attract, develop and retain
our talent. The Asia Pacific BOOST
(Building Our Own Sustainable Talent)
programme is one of many examples of
how we are building our talent pipeline
around the world through a clear focus
on local talent attraction, identification,
mobility and development – all
underpinned by senior leader ownership.

Workplace by Facebook

In 2017 we rolled out Workplace by
Facebook at HEINEKEN. We are using
this as a worldwide internal digital and
mobile collaboration platform, building
communities, sharing insights and
learning from each other. Currently we
already have around 59,000 colleagues
from across the world connected and
engaging with each other on this
new platform.

How we lead directly impacts our
business performance and shapes
our culture. In 2017 we launched our
Leadership Expectations to provide a
simple language that explains what
it takes to lead HEINEKEN into the
future. These common expectations
are embedded in our approaches to
performance management, reward,
selection and development. For example,
over the last year, more than 1,000 senior
leaders have completed 360° feedback
against these expectations.

In 2017, macro economic challenges continued in
the region. Rising inflation and currency pressure
weighed on performance, particularly in Nigeria and
Egypt. Despite this, 2017 marked a return to positive
volume growth in the region.
Heineken® performed well in South Africa with
double digit volume growth and Strongbow saw
triple digit growth. In Sedibeng, South Africa, we
invested in additional capacity. In Ethiopia our
Walia brand had continued success with double
digit volume growth and consequently, we are
extending our Kilinto brewery to add 1.5 million
hectolitres capacity. In Russia, we saw strong
performance of Heineken® 0.0.

Hard currency shortages and devaluations in Africa
have increased demand for local raw materials, which
has put pressure on both availability and pricing.
Our 2017 local1 sourcing percentage dropped
to 42%2, primarily because of a reduction in the
availability and quality of sorghum in Nigeria in the
early part of the year. We continue to invest in local
sourcing to reach our target of 60% in 2020 and

In December 2017, we laid the foundation

This new brewery, incorporating the latest
technologies, in the province of Maputo, will
have a production capacity of 0.8 million
hectolitres. The first bottle of beer is
expected to come off the production line
in the first half of 2019. Aligned with our
ambition of sourcing 60% of our agricultural
raw materials locally in Africa by 2020,
HEINEKEN Mozambique is exploring
the possibility of locally sourcing the raw
materials it will need to produce its beers.

Local sourcing project
for rice in Ivory Coast

Our balanced portfolio of premium, mainstream
and economy brands continues to be part of our
success in the region. We continued to invest in
our existing brands and in product innovation.
Following the successful launch of Ivoire, we also
launched Mützig in Ivory Coast and, to support our
strong growth in the country, we have invested in a
new bottling line.
At the end of last year we commenced the
construction of HEINEKEN’s first brewery with the
latest technologies in Mozambique, which is a major
step forward for our presence in the country.

Revenue (beia)

At the end of 2017, we launched the

between Deutsche Gesellschaft fur

National de Développement de la
Riziculture, Société Conseil Organisation
et Management de Côte d’Ivoire
and HEINEKEN. The KRISPI project
aims to help the local rice farmers to
increase their livelihood and Brassivoire,
our brewery in Ivory Coast to secure
sufficient quantities of broken rice to
use in beer production. The broken rice
is a by-product of rice processing, which
is not widely used as food.

Successful launch of
Heineken® 0.0 in Russia

In Russia, Heineken® 0.0 has been very
well received by consumers since its
successful launch in 2017. Due to the
strong Heineken® brand recognition
in Russia and effective TV and digital
campaigns for Heineken® 0.0, we are
shaping the non-alcoholic beer segment
in the market and making responsible
beer consumption aspirational.

Mexico, Brazil and Haiti delivered strong results.
The region successfully expanded volumes, revenue
and profit in 2017.
Mexico, our largest market in the region, continued
to deliver robust volume growth with excellent
growth from Tecate and Dos Equis.
During the year, HEINEKEN acquired Brasil Kirin, one
of the largest beer and soft drinks producers in Brazil.
This acquisition transforms HEINEKEN’s business by
extending its portfolio and broadening its reach across
Brazil. The integration of our business in Brazil with
Brasil Kirin was successfully concluded ahead of our
expectations. Increased scale and a strengthened
brand portfolio will allow the business to accelerate
premiumisation particularly with Heineken® and Sol,
and enable further growth of the well-established
Schin, Bavaria, Kaiser, Amstel and Devassa brands in
the mainstream and value segments. The Eisenbahn
brand is our fastest growing premium brand in Brazil
which sold more than 1 million hectolitres in 2017.
The US beer market declined in 2017, weighing
on our portfolio of brands. In this context,
effective marketing and strong sales execution
saw Heineken® lager return to growth, partially
offsetting declines of Heineken® Light.
In May 2017, HEINEKEN acquired the remaining
shares in Lagunitas Brewing Company.
Lagunitas has continued to outperform the US
craft beer market. Lagunitas is the market leader in
the IPA segment, the fastest growing sub-segment
within craft.
In Mexico, HEINEKEN donated water to earthquake
survivors. HEINEKEN also supported communities in
Puerto Rico and St. Maarten who were affected by
hurricane Irma in 2017.

Growth of Heineken®
brand in Brazil

In 2017, Heineken® continued to
grow double digit in Brazil, meeting
consumers’ demand for a premium
international beer.

Lagunitas

In 2017, HEINEKEN acquired the
remaining shares in Lagunitas Brewing
Company. To maintain the Lagunitas
culture and free spirit, the company will
continue to operate as an independent
entity within HEINEKEN and will report
within the HEINEKEN Americas Region.

Earthquake water

HEINEKEN Mexico temporarily
transformed one of its breweries to can

other items.

Our performance in the Asia Pacific region was

Significant new developments during the year
included the merger of our Mongolian business with
APU JSC, the country’s leading beverage business.
We also entered into a new Trade Mark Licensing
Agreement for Heineken® and a distribution
agreement for Birra Moretti to replace our joint

Tiger’s growth continued, with the brand selling
11.5 million hectolitres of beer in 2017. Tiger is
continuing to engage millennial consumers through
the ‘Tiger Air-Ink’ campaign as well as the announced
six year partnership with WWF to save the wild tiger.
Whilst Heineken® volume was under pressure in
China and Vietnam, it experienced robust growth in
other markets, and Heineken® Light was launched
successfully in Indonesia. Anchor is performing
well, with double digit growth driven by strong
performance in Malaysia and Cambodia.
We continued to invest for growth in the Asia Pacific
region, including extending our brewing capacity in
Vietnam and Cambodia. We opened a new brewery
in East Timor and acquired the Tuatara craft
brewery in New Zealand.
We are developing a strong pool of local Asian
talent, with over 100 Asia Pacific graduates in our
accelerated talent pipeline.

Go Bold & Go Smooth,

Beer volumes across Europe grew moderately,
but key markets including France, Italy, Spain
and Portugal delivered a particularly strong
performance. Our strategy of focusing on further
premiumisation and innovation supported margin
expansion, while our operational performance was
helped by continuous cost management.
Poland decreased in beer volume partially due
to fewer promotions at retailers. The UK also
experienced a decline as a result of a partial
delisting by a large customer.
Our UK pubs business continued to perform well and in
2017 we completed the acquisition of approximately
1,900 pubs from Punch Taverns. HEINEKEN now owns
the largest pubs business in the market and, more than
ever, this route to market is a key aspect of our strategy.
We launched Heineken® 0.0, demonstrating our
commitment to growing in the low- and no-alcohol
category. Its performance so far has been very
positive across Europe.
HEINEKEN’s cider strategy continues to deliver.
We experienced particular strong performance
in Austria, Poland, Greece, Croatia, Romania and
Ireland. Strongbow Dark Fruit showed excellent
performance, which is one-third of Strongbow
volume in the UK, and now also launched in Poland,
Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia and Slovenia.
Orchard Thieves is growing fast and is now available
in 14 European markets.
During 2017, HEINEKEN Netherlands entered into
a strategic partnership for its Beer & Cider logistics
in the Dutch Out-of-Home market with Sligro Food
Group N.V. (Sligro). Simultaneously, HEINEKEN
Netherlands divested its wholesale operations for the
other (non-Beer & Cider) product categories to Sligro.
As part of our strategy to selectively expand in the craft
& variety segment, HEINEKEN entered a partnership
in the UK with Brixton, a London based craft brewery,
and in Italy we acquired craft brewery HIBU.

Beerwulf, our online craft & variety
e-commerce platform, is a great example
of our e-commerce strategy, and has been
successfully launched in the Netherlands,
Belgium, UK, France and Germany.

Ichnusa

As an example of our premiumisation
strategy, HEINEKEN expanded Ichnusa,
our local jewel brewed for over 100 years
with passion in Sardinia, to the mainland
of Italy. This was supported by an awardwinning campaign showing the unique
Sardinian soul of Ichnusa. As part of this
roll-out we also launched Ichnusa Non
Filtrata, a very successful innovation that
builds on the craft & variety trend.

Renewable energy, Spain

As part of our sustainability drive,
HEINEKEN undertook a number of
sustainability initiatives in Spain, including
the creation of a renewable energy plant
that will fulfil 100% of HEINEKEN Spain’s
electricity demand from 2020, a biomass
plant that will fully power Jaén Brewery
and a solar powered brewery in Seville.

Risk Management

A disciplined approach
to managing our risks

To deliver its strategy, HEINEKEN systematically manages the risks
linked to its daily operations as well as the main risks and opportunities
arising from its business environment.
Business Framework
HEINEKEN’s Risk Management and Internal
Control systems are based on the COSO
reference models and form an integral part
of the HEINEKEN Business Framework.
This framework provides an overview of how
HEINEKEN’s vision, purpose and values ‘We are
HEINEKEN’ underpin the Company’s strategic
objectives and ambition to deliver long-term value
creation, enabled by HEINEKEN’s Governance
Cycle (planning and performance cycle), its
organisational structure ‘We are HEINEKEN’,
the HEINEKEN Code of Business Conduct and
the HEINEKEN Rules.

Behaviours framework, they reflect the
expected attitude in decision-making, including
risk taking.

Organisation and Accountability
HEINEKEN’s risk management and internal
control activities are organised along three
‘lines of defence’:
––Operational management (first line of
defence), has the ownership, responsibility
and accountability for assessing, controlling
and mitigating risks.
––Management is supported by second line
of defence functions (e.g. internal control,
business conduct and other functional risk
management teams). These functions
oversee compliance with HEINEKEN’s
policies, process and controls, facilitate
the implementation of effective risk
management practices and drive continuous
improvements of internal controls.

We are
HEINEKEN

Policies

People

The HEINEKEN Code of Business Conduct
and its underlying policies promote doing
business with fairness and integrity and explain
to all HEINEKEN employees what is expected
from them in this regard. Adherence to the
Code and its policies is supported by regular
communication and training as well as
HEINEKEN’s Speak Up framework. Speak Up
allows and encourages employees and third
parties to report (suspected) misconduct
confidentially and without fear of retaliation.

Systems

Execution and change management

Data

––As third line of defence, HEINEKEN’s internal
audit function (‘Global Audit’) is mandated to
perform Group-wide reviews of key processes,
projects and systems, based on HEINEKEN’s
strategic priorities and most significant
risk areas.
––Global Audit provides independent and
objective assurance and consultancy
services. It employs a systematic and
disciplined approach to evaluate and improve
the organisation’s governance and risk
management processes including reliability
of information, compliance with laws,
regulations and procedures, and efficient and

Heineken N.V. Annual Report 2017

Risk Management (continued)

To support the Executive Board’s external
representations, a formal bi-annual Letter
of Representation (LoR) process is in place.
It requires management to demonstrate
accountability and covers financial and
non-financial reporting disclosures, financial
reporting controls, compliance with the Code
of Conduct and other HEINEKEN Rules as well
as fraud and irregularities.

Risk management
Effective management of risks forms an
integral part of how HEINEKEN operates as
a business and is embedded in day-to-day
operations. HEINEKEN’s risk management
activities seek to identify and appropriately
address any significant threat to the
achievement of the Company’s strategic
objectives, its reputation, the continuity of its
operations and the safety of its employees.
HEINEKEN’s risk management system enables
management to identify, assess, prioritise and
manage risks on a continuous and systematic
basis, and covers all subsidiaries across regions,
countries, markets and corporate functions.
Ongoing identification and assessment of risks,
including new risks arising from changes in the
global or local business environment, are an
integral part of HEINEKEN’s governance and
performance management. Risk assessments
are performed annually by every operating
company and global function, and the
implementation of adequate responses
and progress of risk mitigating measures is
monitored on a quarterly basis. In parallel, the
outcome of these risk analyses is aggregated
on a global level and serves as a basis to
determine HEINEKEN’s risk exposure and risk
management priorities. Accountability for
mitigating, monitoring and reporting on the
most significant risks is assigned to functional
directors, who report on progress and residual
risk levels biannually to the risk committee.

Internal control
HEINEKEN’s internal control activities aim
to provide reasonable assurance as to
the accuracy of financial information, the
Company’s compliance with applicable laws
and internal policies, and the effectiveness of
internal processes.
Internal controls have been defined at
entity-level (HEINEKEN Rules, comprising all
mandatory standards and procedures) and at
process level (Process and Control Standards)
for key processes, including financial reporting,
IT and Tax. Compliance with company policies
is periodically assessed both in OpCos and
in Global Functions. Deviations from the
defined standards are included in a global
monitoring and follow-up tool, which supports
management in addressing these deviations.
Management is responsible for defining
and timely implementation of action plans
to remediate any deficiency identified as
part of these assessments. The results are
reported to the EB in the bi-annual Letter of
Representations. The Company Rules, policies
and controls are periodically updated to reflect
both the Company key risks and the extent
to which the Company is willing and able to
mitigate them.

Risk profile
HEINEKEN is predominantly a single-product
business, operating throughout the world in the
alcohol industry. HEINEKEN is present in more
than 70 countries, with a growing share of its
revenues originated from emerging markets.
An increasingly negative perception in society
towards alcohol could prompt legislators to
implement further restrictive measures such
as limitations on availability, advertising,
sponsorships, distribution and points of sale
and increased tax. This may cause changes
in consumption trends, which could lead to
a decrease in the brand equity and sales of
HEINEKEN’s products.

HEINEKEN has undertaken business activities
with other market parties in the form of
joint ventures and strategic partnerships.
Where HEINEKEN does not have effective
control, decisions taken by these entities may
not be fully harmonised with HEINEKEN’s
strategic objectives. Moreover, HEINEKEN may
not be able to identify and manage risks to the
same extent as in the rest of the Group.

Risk appetite
The international spread of its business, a
robust balance sheet and strong cash flow,
as well as a commitment to prudent financial
management, form the context based on
which HEINEKEN determines its appetite to
risk. A structured risk management process
allows HEINEKEN to take risks in a managed
and controlled manner. Key to determining the
risk appetite is the nature of the risks:
Strategic:
Taking strategic risks is an inherent part of
HEINEKEN’s entrepreneurial heritage. In its
pursuit of balanced growth, HEINEKEN is open
to certain risks linked to its presence in a wide
array of developing countries.
Operational:
Depending on the type of the operational risk,
HEINEKEN’s risk appetite can be described as
cautious to averse. In particular, ensuring its
employees’ and contractors’ safety, delivering
the highest level of product quality and
protecting its reputation have priority over
any other business objective.
Reporting:
HEINEKEN is averse to any risks that could
jeopardise the integrity of its reporting.
Compliance:
HEINEKEN is averse to the risk of non-compliance
with applicable laws or regulations, as well as
with its own Code of Business Conduct.

Risk Management (continued)

Main risks

The following risk overview highlights the
main risks that could hinder HEINEKEN
in achieving its financial and strategic
objectives or could represent a threat to the
business. This overview does not include all
risks and uncertainties that may ultimately
affect the Company: some risks currently
deemed immaterial, could ultimately
have an adverse impact on HEINEKEN’s
financial performance, reputation,
business objectives, employees or assets.
Timely discovery and accurate evaluation
of such risks is at the core of HEINEKEN’s risk
management processes. The financial risks
are dealt with separately in note 30 to the
Financial Statements. The Statement of the
Executive Board is included in the Corporate
Governance Statement on page 31.

Regulatory changes
related to alcohol

Economic and
political environment

What could happen
Alcohol remains under scrutiny in many
markets. This may prompt regulators to
take further measures limiting HEINEKEN’s
freedom to operate, such as restrictions
or bans on advertising and marketing,
sponsorship, availability of products, and
increased taxes and duties leading to lower
revenues and profit.

What could happen
Throughout the world, local or regional
economic and political uncertainties
could impact our business and that of
our customers. In particular, the risk of
an economic recession, change of laws,
trade restrictions, inflation, fluctuations
in exchange rates, devaluation,
nationalisation, financial crisis, or social
unrest could adversely affect our revenues
and profits.

Recent developments
Restrictive measures on alcohol consumption
and sale continue to be taken across
geographies, especially through excise
duties increases as in Vietnam, Greece,
Egypt and Russia. Continued focus by WHO,
OECD, UN and EU on alcohol as part of
the Non-Communicable Disease agenda
could lead to additional restrictions which
would impact HEINEKEN’s business across
multiple geographies.
What we are doing to manage this risk
Responsible consumption is one of the priorities
of HEINEKEN’s Brewing a Better World
sustainability programme. Using the power and
reach of its brands, HEINEKEN strives to make
responsible consumption aspirational and
works closely with local governments, NGOs
and specialists to prevent and reduce harm
caused by abuses such as underage drinking
or drinking and driving.

– Advocating responsible consumption,
pages 135, 142-143

Recent developments
Political risk has expanded beyond emerging
markets and has become a permanent
element of the economic landscape. Brexit and
the change of administration in the US have
created significant additional uncertainties.
Agility has become a priority to enable
businesses to navigate subsequent changes in
laws, currency movements, import restrictions,
scarcity of hard currencies, and their impact on
the Company’s profit.
What we are doing to manage this risk
HEINEKEN has set up various tools to limit
the impact of such events on its business
such as supplier management, short-term
liquidity management, tight foreign exchange
monitoring, prudent balance sheet measures,
and scenario planning. For events which
could threaten the continuity of the business,
contingency plans are in place.

Management capabilities

What could happen
Maintaining strong relationships
with our customers is key for brand
positioning and availability to consumers.
Consolidation among our customers,
emergence of buying alliances and rise of
e-commerce distribution channels may
affect our ability to obtain favourable
pricing and favourable trade terms and
negatively impact our operating margin.

What could happen
Consumers’ preferences and behaviours
are evolving, shaping an increasingly
complex and fragmented beer category.
This requires HEINEKEN to constantly adapt
its product offering, innovate and invest to
maintain the relevance and strength of its
brands. Failure to do so would in the longer
term affect our revenues , market share and
possibly our brand equity.

What could happen
HEINEKEN relies on the skills of its people
to lead its growth agenda and deliver on
its strategic ambitions. HEINEKEN may not
be successful in attracting, developing and
retaining diverse and talented people and
leaders with the required capabilities, which
may jeopardise its capacity to execute its
strategy and achieve the targeted returns.

Recent developments
Retail consolidation and the rise of discounters
have been reshaping the beverage industry
distribution landscape. This has led HEINEKEN
to develop its e-commerce channel, both
B2B and B2C, and to develop a unique and
innovative sales approach to boost its on-trade
business, which has been being rolled out
across all four regions.
What are we doing to manage this risk
HEINEKEN constantly invests in its business
relationships and has developed joint business
plans with distributors and key retailers,
while enhancing sales performance through
commercial capabilities programmes,
customer relationship management at
central and local level, and development
of its e-commerce capabilities.

– Deliver top line growth, page 10

Recent developments
The popularity of craft beer and the rise of lowand no-alcohol products have been the most
noticeable changes in consumer tastes over
the past years. HEINEKEN has fully embraced
these trends, as shown by the acquisition of
Lagunitas, the addition of several specialty
beers to its craft portfolio and the launch of
Heineken® 0.0. to complement its low- and
no-alcohol category.
What are we doing to manage this risk
Over the past years, HEINEKEN has further
strengthened its commercial organisation,
its innovation programme and its marketing
and sales capabilities. Significant investments
have been made in consumer and market
intelligence, new products and formats (both
through innovation and through acquisitions)
and in brand protection to anticipate and
respond to industry changes.

Explore Further:
– Deliver top line growth, page 10
– Advocating responsible consumption, page 143

Recent developments
Hiring employees with particular expertise
remains challenging, both in emerging markets
due to competition between multinationals,
and in developed markets where traditional
industries face competition from new economy
employers. HEINEKEN continues to invest in its
global employer branding, targeting especially
the young and diverse audience it needs to fuel
its talent pipeline.
What are we doing to manage this risk
To secure a strong leadership pipeline, HEINEKEN
has a robust performance management
process in place which is supported by a
leadership development curriculum with
targeted development interventions for various
levels of leaders across the organisation.
Succession planning has been enhanced by
the implementation of Functional Resource
Committees and a renewed People Strategy
that is focused on talent and leadership
development and the responsibility of people
managers to nurture our leaders of the future.

Industry consolidation

Health and Safety

Product safety and integrity

What could happen
Consolidation of the alcoholic beverage
industry may affect existing market
dynamics in the future due to competitive
disadvantage with suppliers and increased
competition on commercial spend and
customer acquisition strategies.

What could happen
HEINEKEN is committed to providing
a safe workplace for all employees and
contractors. Despite the controls in place,
incidents and accidents may happen
in the brewery, our supply chain and in
HEINEKEN’s route-to-market, leading to
physical injuries or fatalities to employees,
contractors or members of the public.

What could happen
Poor quality or contamination of any of
the HEINEKEN products, be it accidental
or malicious, could result in health hazards,
reputational damage, financial liabilities
and product recalls.

Recent developments
Despite recent market consolidation, beer
remains a very local industry with respective
country shares more relevant than global
share. HEINEKEN remains committed
to winning through a portfolio strategy
focused on premium and led by Heineken®.
Within individual markets, international and
local brands complement Heineken® and
provide valuable scale.
What are we doing to manage this risk
HEINEKEN is constantly working on improving
its cost efficiency, while rolling out its strategy
to maintain and develop its competitive
advantages, in particular in the premium
and cider markets. Through a number of
acquisitions, HEINEKEN has evolved its
footprint extensively to reach an optimal
balance of both higher growth developing
markets and more stable developed markets,
and to build an extensive and complementary
brand portfolio alongside its flagship
Heineken® brand.

Recent developments
Given its growing presence in emerging
markets, safety is an ongoing challenge and a
permanent focus area. Rolled up throughout
all operations, the HEINEKEN Life Saving Rules
target the activities that carry the greatest
safety threats to employees and contractors.
Despite these efforts, several significant fatal
accidents have occurred, underlining the
importance of realising further improvements
in the area of safety. In particular, a specific
programme to improve road safety, being one
of the highest risk areas, has been set up and is
being rolled out.
What are we doing to manage this risk
HEINEKEN has established ‘Safety First’ as
a key employee behaviour and Health and
Safety as a pillar of its Brewing a Better World
programme. The global safety programme
in place aims at enhancing global standards,
organisation and processes, and strengthening
safety leadership and safety behaviours.
Continuous improvement is achieved through
global compliance monitoring, systematic
gap-closing and central reporting of accidents,
incidents and near-misses.

Explore Further:
– Promoting Health and Safety, pages 135, 144

Recent developments
Innovations and increased local sourcing
have led HEINEKEN to further strengthen the
controls on recipe governance and production
processes in order to maintain its food safety
and quality standards. Changes to the
environment in recent years, such as high speed
of information, growing impact of social media
and tougher legal environment in certain
jurisdictions can magnify the impact of any
quality issues or allegation thereof.
What are we doing to manage this risk
HEINEKEN has established a comprehensive
company-wide Quality Assurance programme
covering production standards, recipe
governance, suppliers’ governance, production
material risk and country risk. Should this risk
materialise, Global recall and crisis procedures
are in place to mitigate the impact.

What could happen
Disruptions in the supply chain could
lead to HEINEKEN’s inability to deliver
products to key customers, revenue loss
and brand damage. Significant changes
in the availability or price of raw materials,
commodities, energy and water may
result in a shortage of those resources or
increased costs.

What could happen
HEINEKEN’s business relies heavily on its
IT infrastructure. Failure of its IT system
or a breach in the security infrastructure
may lead to business disruption, loss of
confidential information, breach of data
privacy, financial and reputational damage.

What could happen
On social media, concerns related to
HEINEKEN or any of its products, even when
unfounded, could impact the Company’s
reputation and the image of its products.
HEINEKEN may not be able to control
information or respond in a timely manner
to reputation threats, which could affect
its brand equity and income-generating
capacity at scale and at pace.

Recent developments
Political instability, terrorism, climate change
and in particular growing water scarcity and its
effects on crop yield and grain prices, require
both the market and governments to take
measures, which will in the short term result in
additional costs to the business.
What are we doing to manage this risk
Business continuity plans have been developed
for HEINEKEN’s key brands in all key markets,
and back-up plans are in place in all operating
companies. Business resilience is further
strengthened through ownership of several
strategic malteries, long-term procurement
contracts, water management plans and
central management of global insurance
policies. Taking a longer-term approach to
business continuity, HEINEKEN has included
water resources protection and sustainable
sourcing in the priorities of its Brewing a Better
World sustainability programme.

– Reducing CO2 emissions, pages 134, 138–140
– Sourcing sustainably, pages 134, 140–141

Recent developments
The rise of the Internet of Things and the
expansion of Cloud uptake, combined with
increasing professionalism of online threat
actors puts Information Security on the map
as a corporate risk, both in terms of business
continuity and of data privacy. This is also
recognised by global regulations, such as the
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR),
where mismanagement of security and data
breaches becomes financially punitive.
What are we doing to manage this risk
HEINEKEN has developed a comprehensive
information security policy and framework
addressing IT security, continuity and
confidentiality. The dedicated Risk
Management team performs central
monitoring of IT controls and focuses on
enhancing the resilience of HEINEKEN’s
IT infrastructure.

Recent developments
While robust social media risk management
measures are now in place, social media crises
increasingly happen via private channels (e.g.
WhatsApp) and cannot therefore always
be tracked. Moreover, malicious attempts
to spread false material becomes ever more
sophisticated with substantial spend behind it.
What are we doing to manage this risk
HEINEKEN has set up continuous monitoring
of the main social media platforms, in
several languages, employee training in
digital communication, and an incident
response system that includes a dedicated
digital dashboard and a dedicated crisis
communication team. Learnings from media
crisis are shared in the organisation to drive
continuous improvement.

Non-compliance

What could happen
In the last years, HEINEKEN has engaged
in several significant business improvement
projects. The large number of operating
companies and their varying level of
integration represent a specific challenge
to these projects. These strategic
transformation programmes may not
deliver the expected benefits or may incur
significant cost or time overruns.

What could happen
Historically HEINEKEN has grown its
footprint organically and through mergers
and acquisitions, which had led to a diverse
landscape of processes and systems and a
low level of centralisation. Deviations from
the common accounting and reporting
processes and related controls could
impair the accuracy of the financial and
non-financial data used for Group reporting
and external communication.

What could happen
Changes in the legal and regulatory
environment tend to increase the risk
of non-compliance to local and global
laws and regulations. Failure to comply
with applicable laws and regulations
could lead to claims, enforcement and
reputational damage.

Recent developments
The Group portfolio of global projects now
contains more than 40 programmes and
has supported the implementation of new
capabilities in the area of finance, supply chain,
procurement and human resources, thereby
serving HEINEKEN’s efficiency targets and key
risk mitigation.
What are we doing to manage this risk
By taking a portfolio approach, applying
consistent project methodology and
governance, and placing ownership of each
of them at top management level, HEINEKEN
is able to prioritise and optimise resource
allocation across its major projects to ensure
they deliver on their objectives.

Recent developments
Since 2015, HEINEKEN has engaged in a
substantial process and IT simplification and
standardisation project, which will help to
achieve further efficiency gains while delivering
fast and robust reporting, continuously
strengthening its control environment.
What are we doing to manage this risk
HEINEKEN has implemented a common Risk
and Control Framework across its operating
companies which includes standardised
internal controls on financial reporting,
common accounting policies and standard
chart of accounts, periodic mandatory training,
and active monitoring of critical access and
segregation of duties conflicts. In 2017,
HEINEKEN evolved its governance around
non-financial data to further improve the
quality of the data reported under its
Brewing a Better World programme.

Explore Further:
– Reporting basis and governance of non-financial indicators,
pages 148–149

Recent developments
Across many geographies, law enforcement
has become more systematic than in the
past, in particular with regard to anti-bribery
and corruption, competition and data privacy
laws, and human rights. This leads to an
increased risk of being subject to allegations
of violations of laws and regulations.
Over the years, HEINEKEN has constantly been
looking to enhance its internal compliance
system and resilience to the changes of the
legal environment.
What are we doing to manage this risk
HEINEKEN has embedded legal compliance
in its risk and controls system, and has
established processes and governance to drive
implementation and compliance with the
Company Rules and its HEINEKEN Code of
Business Conduct.

Operating profit (beia)
Operating profit (beia) was €3,759 million, up 9.3% organically, excluding €188 million negative foreign currency impact and €80 million increase from
consolidation changes. Growth was driven by higher revenue and cost efficiencies while we continued to increase the support to our brands with
marketing and selling expenses.

Share of net profit of associates and joint ventures (beia)
Share of net profit of associates and joint ventures (beia) decreased €8 million to €153 million, reflecting lower net profit from the joint venture
operation in the Republic of the Congo due to difficult market conditions.

Net finance expenses (beia)
Net interest expenses (beia) increased by €19 million to €374 million, reflecting a higher average net debt position. The average interest rate (beia) in
2017 was 3.0% (2016: 3.1%). Other net finance expenses (beia), which primarily includes the impact of currency revaluation on outstanding payables
in foreign currencies, increased by €22 million to €136 million.

Income tax expense (beia)
The effective tax rate (beia) was 27.6%, a slight decrease on the rate in 2016 (28.3%) due to one-off tax benefits in 2017.

Heineken N.V. Annual Report 2017

Financial Review (continued)
Capital expenditure related to property, plant and equipment amounted to €1,696 million in 2017 (2016: €1,757 million) representing 7.7% of
revenues. The investments include new capacity in Ethiopia, Mexico, Cambodia, Vietnam, Haiti and a new brewery in the Ivory Coast.
Free operating cash flow amounted to €2,031 million (2016: €1,773 million), higher than last year primarily due to higher cash flow generated from
operations and lower operational investing activities. Cash flow from changes in working capital in 2017 was again positive, albeit lower than last year
due to one offs in receivables and a less favourable change in inventories.

Equity attributable to equity holders of the Company increased by €83 million to €13,321 million, mainly driven by net profit of €1,935 million being
offset by a negative other comprehensive income impact of €1,054 million mainly relating to translation differences. Furthermore dividends paid out
of €775 million reduced the equity attributable to the equity holders of the Company.
Total gross debt amounts to €15,378 million (2016: €14,570 million). The gross debt includes €1,062 million of overdrafts in the cash pool with legally
enforceable rights to offset against cash. Net debt increased to €12,879 million (2016: €11,293 million) as cash outflow for dividends and acquisitions
exceeded the positive free operating cash flow and positive foreign currency impact on debt.
HEINEKEN remains focused on cash flow generation and disciplined working capital management, with a commitment to a long-term target net
debt/EBITDA (beia) ratio of below 2.5. The pro forma net debt/EBITDA (beia) ratio was 2.5 on 31 December 2017 (2016: 2.3).
In 2017 the following notes were issued under HEINEKEN’s Euro Medium Term Note Programme:
––SDG150 million 5-year Notes with a floating rate coupon (February 2017)
––€500 million 15-year Notes with a coupon of 2.02% (May 2017)
––€800 million 12-year Notes with a coupon of 1.50% (October 2017)
On 20 March 2017, HEINEKEN extended and amended its €2.5 billion revolving credit facility maturing in May 2021. The facility has been increased to
€3.5 billion and is now set to mature in May 2022. The facility is committed by a group of 19 banks and has two further one-year extension options.
On 29 March 2017, HEINEKEN placed USD 1.1 billion of long 10-year 144A/RegS US Notes with a coupon of 3.50%, and USD 650 million of 30 year

HEINEKEN has 576,002,613 shares in issue. For the calculation of 2017 basic EPS, the weighted impact of the treasury shares and shares purchased
for the employee incentive programme reduced the number of weighted average shares outstanding to 570,074,335 (569,737,210 in 2016). For the
calculation of 2017 diluted EPS, the number of weighted average outstanding shares is adjusted for the amount of shares to be delivered under the
employee incentive programme, resulting in a weighted average diluted number of shares of 570,652,111 (570,370,392 in 2016).

Profit appropriation
The Heineken N.V. dividend policy is to pay out a ratio of 30% to 40% of full year net profit (beia). For 2017, payment of a total cash dividend of
€1.47 per share (2016: €1.34) will be proposed to the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (AGM) on 19 April 2018. This represents an increase
of 9.7% versus 2016, translating into a 37.3% payout. If approved, a final dividend of €0.93 per share will be paid on 2 May 2018, as an interim dividend
of €0.54 per share was paid on 10 August 2017. The payment will be subject to a 15% Dutch withholding tax. The ex-final dividend date for
Heineken N.V. shares will be 23 April 2018.

Heineken N.V. Annual Report 2017

Corporate Governance Statement
Introduction
Heineken N.V. (the ‘Company’) is a public company with limited liability incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands. Its shares are listed on the
Amsterdam Stock Exchange, Euronext Amsterdam.
The Company’s management and supervision structure is organised in a so-called two-tier system, which consists of an Executive Board (made up of
two executive directors) and a Supervisory Board (made up of 10 non-executive directors). The Supervisory Board supervises the Executive Board and
ensures that external experience and knowledge are embedded in the Company’s way of operating. These two Boards are independent of one
another and accountable to the Annual General Meeting (AGM).
The Company is required to comply with, among other regulations, the Dutch Corporate Governance Code which has been amended on 8 December
2016 (the ‘Code’). Deviations from the Code are explained in accordance with the Code’s “comply or explain” principle.
In this report, the Company addresses its corporate governance structure and states to what extent it applies the best practice provisions of the Code,
and explains which best practice provisions of the Code the Company does not apply, and why. This report also includes the information that the
Company is required to disclose pursuant to the Dutch governmental decree on Article 10 Takeover Directive and the governmental decree on
Corporate Governance. Substantial changes in the Company’s corporate governance structure and in the Company’s compliance with the Code, if
any, will be submitted to the AGM for discussion under a separate agenda item.

Executive Board
General
The role of the Executive Board is to manage the Company, which means, among other things, that it is responsible for setting and achieving the
operational and financial objectives of the Company, the design of the strategy to achieve the objectives, the parameters to be applied in relation to
the strategy (for example, in respect of the financial ratios), the Company culture aimed at long-term value creation, the associated risk profile, the
development of results and corporate social responsibility issues that are relevant to the Company. Further detailed information can be found in the
CEO statement, Our Performance, Our impact on society: from Barley to Bar, Our Business Priorities and the Risk Management section. The Executive
Board is accountable for this to the Supervisory Board and to the AGM. In discharging its role, the Executive Board shall be guided by the interests of
the Company and its affiliated enterprises, taking into consideration the interests of the Company’s stakeholders. The Executive Board is responsible
for complying with all primary and secondary legislation, for managing the risks associated with the Company’s activities and for financing
the Company.
The Company has four operating regions: Africa Middle East & Eastern Europe, Americas, Asia Pacific and Europe. Each region is headed by a
President. The two members of the Executive Board, the four Presidents and four functional Chief Officers (namely Commercial, Corporate Affairs,
Human Resources and Supply Chain) jointly form the Executive Team. The choice to work with an Executive Team is to ensure effective implementation
of the key priorities and strategies across the organisation. Throughout the year, members of the Executive Team were invited to give presentations to
the Supervisory Board. A two-day meeting was also held between the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board to discuss the Company’s strategic
priorities and main risks of the business also in light of its long-term value creation and Company culture contributing to this. During this meeting,
members of the Executive Team presented their respective strategic topics and risks per region or function, as the case may be.
Executive Board members are appointed by the AGM from a non-binding nomination drawn up by the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board
appoints one of the Executive Board members as Chairman/CEO. The AGM can dismiss members of the Executive Board by a majority of the votes
cast, if the subject majority at least represents one-third of the issued capital.
At the 2017 AGM, the Supervisory Board nominated Mr. Jean-François van Boxmeer for re-appointment for a four-year term as member of the
Executive Board and Chairman/CEO, which proposal was adopted.

Corporate Governance Statement (continued)
Composition of the Executive Board
The Executive Board currently consists of two members, Chairman/CEO Jean-François (J.F.M.L.) van Boxmeer and CFO Laurence (L.M.) Debroux.
Information on these Executive Board members is provided below.
Jean-François (J.F.M.L.) van Boxmeer (1961)
Belgian nationality; male.
Initial appointment in 2001;
Reappointment: 2017*;
four-year term ends in 2021;
Chairman/CEO (since 2005).
No supervisory board seats (or non-executive board memberships) in Large Dutch Entities**.
Other positions***: Mondelez International, USA; Henkel AG & Co., Germany; National Opera & Ballet, Netherlands (Chairman).
Laurence (L.M.) Debroux (1969)
French nationality; female.
Initial appointment in 2015;
four-year term ends in 2019;
CFO (since 2015).
Supervisory board seats (or non-executive board memberships) in Large Dutch Entities**: EXOR Holding N.V., the Netherlands.
Other positions***: HEC (Ecole des Hautes Etudes Commerciales) Paris, France.
* For the maximum period of four years.
**	Large Dutch Entities are Dutch N.V.s, B.V.s or Foundations (that are required to prepare annual accounts pursuant to Chapter 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code or similar legislation) that meet two of the following
criteria (on a consolidated basis) on two consecutive balance sheet dates:
(i) The value of the assets (according to the balance sheet with the explanatory notes and on the basis of acquisition and manufacturing costs) exceeds €20 million;
(ii) The net turnover exceeds €40 million;
(iii) The average number of employees is at least 250.
*** Under ‘Other positions’, other functions are mentioned that may be relevant to performance of the duties of the Executive Board.

Best practice provision 2.2.1 of the Code recommends that an Executive Board member is appointed for a maximum period of four years and that a
member may be reappointed for a term of not more than four years at a time. In compliance with this best practice provision, the Supervisory Board
has drawn up a rotation schedule in order to avoid, as far as possible, a situation in which Executive Board members retire at the same time.
Members of the Executive Board are not allowed to hold more than two supervisory board memberships or non-executive directorships in a Large
Dutch Entity or foreign equivalent. Acceptance of such external supervisory board memberships or non-executive directorships by members of the
Executive Board is subject to approval by the Supervisory Board, which has delegated this authority to the Selection & Appointment Committee.

Diversity
The importance of diversity is recognised by the Company as described in the Diversity Policy for the Supervisory Board, Executive Board and
Executive Team, which considers the elements of a diverse composition in terms of nationality, gender, age, expertise and experience. It is the aim of
the Company to reflect this in its composition and strives to give appropriate weight to the diversity policy in the selection and appointment process,
while taking into account the overall profile and selection criteria for the appointments of suitable candidates to the Executive Board. In terms of
gender diversity and pursuant to Dutch law, executive boards of large Dutch public companies, such as Heineken N.V., are deemed to have a balanced
composition if they consist of at least 30% female and 30% male members. Currently, the Executive Board is composed of one male and one female
member, and is therefore deemed to be balanced within the meaning of Dutch law.

Conflict of Interest
Dealing with (apparent) conflicts of interest between the Company and members of its Executive Board is governed by the Articles of Association of
the Company (the ‘Articles of Association’) and the Code. A member of the Executive Board shall not take part in any discussion or decision-making
that involves a subject or transaction in relation to which he has a personal conflict of interest with the Company. Decisions to enter into transactions
under which members have conflicts of interest that are of material significance to the Company and/or the relevant member(s) of the Executive
Board require the approval of the Supervisory Board. Any such decisions shall be published in the Annual Report for the relevant year, along with a
reference to the conflict of interest and a declaration that the relevant best practice provisions of the Code have been complied with. In 2017, no
transactions were reported under which a member of the Executive Board had a conflict of interest that was of material significance.

Remuneration
In line with the remuneration policy adopted by the AGM, the remuneration of the members of the Executive Board is determined by the Supervisory
Board, upon recommendation of the Remuneration Committee. The remuneration policy and the elements of the remuneration of the Executive
Board members are set out in the Remuneration Report and Notes 27 and 33 to the Financial Statements. The main elements of the employment
agreement with Mr. Van Boxmeer and the service agreement with Mrs. Debroux are available on our corporate website.

Supervisory Board
General
The role of the Supervisory Board is to supervise the management of the Executive Board and the general affairs of the Company and its affiliated
enterprises, as well as to assist the Executive Board by providing advice. In discharging its role, the Supervisory Board shall be guided by the interests
of the Company and its affiliated enterprises and shall take into account the relevant interest of the Company’s stakeholders.
The supervision of the Executive Board by the Supervisory Board includes the achievement of the Company’s objectives, the corporate strategy
and the risks inherent in the business activities, the design and effectiveness of the internal risk and control system, the financial reporting process,
compliance with primary and secondary legislation, the Company-shareholder relationship and corporate social responsibility issues that are relevant
to the Company. The Supervisory Board evaluates at least once a year the corporate strategy and main risks to the business, and the result of the
assessment by the Executive Board of the design and effectiveness of the internal risk management and control system, as well as any significant
changes thereto.
The division of duties within the Supervisory Board and the procedure of the Supervisory Board are laid down in the Regulations for the Supervisory
Board, which are available on our corporate website.
The Supervisory Board members are appointed by the AGM from a non-binding nomination drawn up by the Supervisory Board. The AGM can
dismiss members of the Supervisory Board by a majority of the votes cast, if the subject majority at least represents one-third of the issued capital.

Composition of the Supervisory Board
The Supervisory Board consists of 10 members: Hans Wijers (Chairman), José Antonio Fernández Carbajal (Vice-Chairman), Maarten Das,
Michel de Carvalho, Annemiek Fentener van Vlissingen, Christophe Navarre, Javier Astaburuaga Sanjinés, Jean Marc Huët, Pamela Mars Wright
and Yonca Brunini.
The Supervisory Board endorses the principle that the composition of the Supervisory Board shall be such that its members are able to act critically
and independently of one another and of the Executive Board and any particular interests. Each Supervisory Board member is capable of assessing
the broad outline of the overall strategy of the Company and its businesses and carrying out its duties properly.
Given the structure of the Heineken Group, the Company is of the opinion that, in the context of preserving the continuity of the Heineken Group and
ensuring a focus on long-term value creation, it is in its best interest and that of its stakeholders that the Supervisory Board includes a fair and adequate
representation of persons who are related by blood or marriage to the late Mr. A.H. Heineken (former Chairman of the Executive Board), or who are
members of the Board of Directors of Heineken Holding N.V., even if those persons would not, formally speaking, be considered ‘independent’ within
the meaning of best practice provision 2.1.8 of the Code.
Currently, the majority of the Supervisory Board (i.e. six of its 10 members) qualify as ‘independent’ as per best practice provision 2.1.8 of the Code.
There are four members whom in a strictly formal sense do not meet the applicable criteria for being ‘independent’ as set out in the Code: Mr. de Carvalho
(who is the spouse of Mrs. C.L. de Carvalho – Heineken, the daughter of the late Mr. A.H. Heineken, and also an executive director of Heineken Holding
N.V.), Mr. Das (who is the Chairman of Heineken Holding N.V.), Mr. Fernández Carbajal (who is a non-executive director of Heineken Holding N.V.
and representative of FEMSA) and Mr. Astaburuaga Sanjinés (who is a representative of FEMSA). However, the Supervisory Board has ascertained
that Mr. de Carvalho, Mr. Das, Mr. Fernández Carbajal and Mr. Astaburuaga Sanjinés in fact act critically and independently. Since Mr. de Carvalho,
Mr Das, Mr. Fernández Carbajal and Mr. Astaburuaga Sanjinés are representing or affiliated with Heineken Holding N.V. or FEMSA who (in)directly hold
more than 10% of the shares in our Company, the maximum of one representative or affiliate per such shareholder of best practice provision 2.1.7 sub iii
of the Code is not complied with and as a consequence, the Company also does not comply with best practice provision 2.1.10 of the Code, to the
extent that this provision provides that the Supervisory Board report shall state that best practice provision 2.1.7 through 2.1.9 has been fulfilled.
In line with the belief that the focus on long-term value creation is best ensured by a fair and adequate representation of persons who are related
by blood or marriage to the late Mr. A.H. Heineken (former Chairman of the Executive Board) or who are members of the Board of Directors of
Heineken Holding N.V., best practice provision 2.2.2 of the Code is not applied to Mr. de Carvalho, Mr. Das and Mr. Fernández Carbajal which provides
that a person may be appointed to the Supervisory Board for a maximum of two four-year terms, followed by two terms of two years each with an
explanation in the Corporate Governance Statement. It should also be noted that a non-binding nomination for the reappointment of Mr.
Fernandez Carbájal and Mr Astaburuaga Sanjinés for a period of four years shall be submitted to the AGM. Both are representatives of FEMSA
(that (in)directly holds a 14.76% economic interest in the Company), and their respective appointments to the Supervisory Board are based on the
Corporate Governance Agreement, which was concluded between (among others) the Company and FEMSA on 30 April 2010, and which was
approved by the AGM on 22 April 2010 (in connection with the acquisition by the Company of FEMSA’s beer activities). A reappointment of Mr.
Fernández Carbajal and Mr. Astaburuaga Sanjinés for a period of four years is a deviation of the applicable two-year appointment term as per
best practice provision 2.2.2. of the Code. It is however deemed to be in line with the profile of the Supervisory Board and a reflection of FEMSA’s
involvement as a long-term shareholder of the Company.
The Supervisory Board has drawn up a rotation schedule in order to avoid, as far as possible, a situation in which many Supervisory Board members
retire at the same time. The rotation schedule is available on our corporate website.

Corporate Governance Statement (continued)
Profile and Diversity
The Supervisory Board has prepared a profile of its size and composition, taking account of the nature of the business, its activities and the desired
expertise and background of the Supervisory Board members. The profile deals with the aspects of diversity in the composition of the Supervisory
Board that are relevant to the Company and states what specific objective is pursued by the Supervisory Board in relation to diversity. At least one
member of the Supervisory Board shall be a financial expert with relevant knowledge and experience of financial administration and accounting for
listed companies or other large legal entities. The composition of the Supervisory Board shall be such that it is able to carry out its duties properly.
The profile is available on our corporate website.
The importance of diversity is also described in the Diversity Policy for the Supervisory Board, Executive Board and Executive Team, which considers the
elements of a diverse composition in terms of nationality, gender, age, expertise and experience. With respect to gender, Dutch law stipulates that
supervisory boards of large Dutch public companies, such as Heineken N.V., are deemed to have a balanced composition if they consist of at least 30%
female and 30% male members. The Supervisory Board currently consists of 10 members, seven male (70%) and three female (30%) members and is
therefore deemed to be balanced within the meaning of Dutch law. The Supervisory Board will also take the balanced composition requirements into
account when nominating and selecting new candidates for the Supervisory Board and has established a list of potential female candidates who will
be considered should a vacancy in the Supervisory Board arise. The Supervisory Board also notes that, in its opinion, gender is only one element of
diversity, and that experience, background, knowledge, skills and insight are equally important and relevant criteria in selecting new members as is also
reflected in its profile.

Regulations of the Supervisory Board
The tasks and responsibilities, as well as internal procedural matters for the Supervisory Board, are addressed in the Regulations of the Supervisory
Board, and are available on our corporate website.
The Supervisory Board appoints from its members a Chairman (currently Mr. G.J. Wijers). The Chairman of the Supervisory Board may not be a former
member of the Executive Board. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board determines the agenda, chairs the meetings of the Supervisory Board,
ensures the proper functioning of the Supervisory Board and its Committees, arranges for the adequate provision of information to its members and
acts on behalf of the Supervisory Board as the main contact for the Executive Board and for shareholders regarding the functioning of the Executive
Board and the Supervisory Board members. The Chairman also ensures the orderly and efficient conduct of the AGM.
The Chairman of the Supervisory Board is assisted in his role by the Company Secretary. All members of the Supervisory Board have access to the advice
and services of the Company Secretary. The Company Secretary is responsible for ensuring that procedures are followed and that the Supervisory
Board acts in accordance with its statutory obligations as well as its obligations under the Articles of Association.
The Supervisory Board appoints from its members a Vice-Chairman (currently Mr. J.A. Fernández Carbajal). The Vice-Chairman of the Supervisory
Board acts as deputy for the Chairman. The Vice-Chairman acts as contact for individual Supervisory Board members and Executive Board members
concerning the functioning of the Chairman of the Supervisory Board.
The Supervisory Board can only adopt resolutions in a meeting if the majority of its members is present or represented at that meeting. In such
meetings, resolutions must be adopted by absolute majority of the votes cast. In addition, approval of a resolution by the Supervisory Board, as
referred to in Article 8, section 6 under a, b and c of the Articles of Association, requires the affirmative vote of the delegated member.

Induction and training
After appointment to the Supervisory Board, members receive an induction programme, drawn up by the Company in consultation with the
Chairman of the Supervisory Board. The programme includes a general information package in respect of the Company and its corporate
governance, as well as meetings with members of the Executive Team and other senior management leaders, and a tour of our brewery in
Zoeterwoude, the Netherlands. Furthermore, the Executive Board provides regular updates to the Supervisory Board on the Company’s operations,
legal matters, corporate governance, accounting and compliance.

Conflict of Interest
The Articles of Association and the Regulations of the Supervisory Board prescribe how to deal with (apparent) conflicts of interest between the
Company and members of the Supervisory Board. A member of the Supervisory Board shall not take part in any discussion or decision-making that
involves a subject or transaction in relation to which he has a personal conflict of interest with the Company. Decisions to enter into transactions under
which Supervisory Board members have conflicts of interest that are of material significance to the Company and/or the relevant member(s) of the
Supervisory Board require the approval of the Supervisory Board. Any such decisions shall be published in the Annual Report for the relevant year,
along with a reference to the conflict of interest and a declaration that the relevant best practice provisions of the Code have been complied with.
Note 33 of the 2017 Financial Statements sets out related party transactions in 2017.

Remuneration
Supervisory Board members receive a fixed annual remuneration fee, as determined by the AGM. More information on the remuneration of Supervisory
Board members can be found in Note 33 to the 2017 Financial Statements.

Corporate Governance Statement (continued)
Resolutions subject to Supervisory Board approval
Certain resolutions of the Executive Board are subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board. Examples are resolutions concerning the operational
and financial objectives of the Company, the strategy designed to achieve the objectives, the parameters to be applied in relation to the strategy
(for example, in respect of the financial ratios) and corporate social responsibility issues that are relevant to the Company. Also, decisions to enter into
transactions under which Executive Board or Supervisory Board members would have conflicts of interest that are of material significance to the
Company and/or to the relevant Executive Board member/Supervisory Board member require the approval of the Supervisory Board. Further reference
is made to Article 8 paragraph 6 of the Articles of Association, which contains a list of resolutions of the Executive Board that require Supervisory
Board approval.

Delegated Member
The AGM may appoint one of the Supervisory Board members as Delegated Member. Mr. M. Das currently acts as the Delegated Member.
The delegation to the Delegated Member does not extend beyond the duties of the Supervisory Board and does not comprise the management
of the Company. It intends to effect more intensive supervision and advice, and more regular consultation with the Executive Board. The Delegated
Member has a veto right concerning resolutions of the Supervisory Board to approve the resolutions of the Executive Board referred to in Article 8
paragraph 6 under a, b and c of the Articles of Association of the Company.
The role of Delegated Member is consistent with best practice provision 2.3.8 of the Code, except insofar that the delegation is not temporary but is
held for the term for which the member concerned is appointed by the AGM. The Company is of the opinion that the position of Delegated Member,
which has been in existence since 1952, befits the structure of the Company.

Committees
The Supervisory Board has five committees: the Preparatory Committee, the Audit Committee, the Remuneration Committee, the Selection &
Appointment Committee and the Americas Committee. The function of these committees is to prepare the decision-making of the Supervisory Board.
The Supervisory Board has drawn up regulations for each committee, setting out the role and responsibility of the committee concerned, its composition
and the manner in which it discharges its duties. These regulations are available on our corporate website. In 2017, more than half of the members of
the Audit Committee were independent within the meaning of best practice provision 2.1.8 of the Code. For the Remuneration Committee and the
Selection and Appointment Committee the independence criteria of best practice provision 2.3.4 are not met.
The Report of the Supervisory Board states the composition of the committees, the number of committee meetings and the main items discussed.

Preparatory Committee
The Preparatory Committee prepares decision-making of the Supervisory Board on matters not already handled by any of the other committees,
such as in relation to acquisitions and investments.

Audit Committee
The Audit Committee may not be chaired by the Chairman of the Supervisory Board or by a former member of the Executive Board.
At least one member of the Audit Committee shall be a financial expert with relevant knowledge and experience of financial administration and
accounting for listed companies or other large legal entities.
The Audit Committee focuses on supervising the activities of the Executive Board with respect to (i) the operation of the internal risk management
and control system, including the enforcement of the relevant primary and secondary legislation and supervising the operation of codes of conduct,
(ii) the provision of financial information by the Company, (iii) compliance with recommendations and observations of internal and external auditors,
(iv) the role and functioning of the internal audit function, (v) the policy of the Company on tax risk management, (vi) relations with the external
auditor, including, in particular, its independence, remuneration and any non-audit services for the Company, (vii) the financing of the Company and
(viii) the applications of information and communication technology.
The Audit Committee acts as the principal contact for the external auditor if the external auditor discovers irregularities in the content of the
financial reporting.
The Audit Committee meets with the external auditor as often as it considers necessary, but at least once a year, without the Executive Board
members being present.

Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee may not be chaired by the Chairman of the Supervisory Board or by a former member of the Executive Board
or by a Supervisory Board member who is a member of the management board of another listed company. However, given the structure of the
Heineken Group and the character of the Board of Directors of Heineken Holding N.V., the regulations of the Remuneration Committee permit that
the Remuneration Committee is chaired by a Supervisory Board member who is a member of the Board of Directors of Heineken Holding N.V.
The current Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, Mr. M. Das, is a Non-Executive Director (and Chairman) of Heineken Holding N.V.
No more than one member of the Remuneration Committee may be a member of the management board of another Dutch listed company.
The Remuneration Committee, inter alia, makes the proposal to the Supervisory Board for the remuneration policy to be pursued, and makes a proposal
for the remuneration of the individual members of the Executive Board for adoption by the Supervisory Board.

Corporate Governance Statement (continued)
Selection & Appointment Committee
The Selection & Appointment Committee, inter alia, (i) draws up selection criteria and appointment procedures for Supervisory Board members and
Executive Board members, (ii) periodically assesses the size and composition of the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board, and makes a proposal
for a composition profile of the Supervisory Board, (iii) periodically assesses the functioning of individual Supervisory Board members and Executive
Board members and reports on this to the Supervisory Board, (iv) makes proposals for appointments and reappointments, (v) supervises the policy of
the Executive Board on the selection criteria and appointment procedures for senior management, and (vi) decides on a request from Executive Board
members to accept a board membership of a Large Dutch Entity (as defined above) or foreign equivalent.

Americas Committee
The Americas Committee advises the Supervisory Board on the overall strategic direction of the Americas Region and reviews and evaluates the
performance, the organisation and the management in the Americas Region.

General Meeting of Shareholders
Annually, within six months of the end of the financial year in which the AGM should be held, inter alia, the following items shall be brought forward:
(i) the discussion of the Annual Report, (ii) the discussion and adoption of the financial statements, (iii) discharge of the members of the Executive
Board for their management, (iv) discharge of the members of the Supervisory Board for their supervision on the management and (v) appropriation
of profits. The AGM shall be held in Amsterdam.

Convocation
Pursuant to the law, the Executive Board or the Supervisory Board shall convene the AGM with a convocation period of at least 42 days (excluding the
date of the meeting, but including the convocation date).
The Executive Board and the Supervisory Board are obliged to convene an AGM upon request of shareholders individually or collectively owning 25%
of the shares. Such meeting shall then be held within eight weeks from the request and shall deal with the subjects as stated by those who wish to hold
the meeting.

Right to include items on the agenda
If the Executive Board has been requested in writing not later than 60 days prior to the date of the AGM to deal with an item by one or more shareholders
who solely or jointly (i) represent at least 1% of the issued capital or (ii) at least represent a value of €50 million, then the item will be included in the
convocation or announced in a similar way. A request of a shareholder for an item to be included on the agenda of the AGM needs to be
substantiated. The principles of reasonableness and fairness may allow the Executive Board to refuse the request.
The Code provides the following in best practice provision 4.1.6: “A shareholder should only exercise the right to put items on the agenda after they
have consulted with the management board on this. If one or more shareholders intend to request that an item be put on the agenda that may result
in a change in the company’s strategy, for example as a result of the dismissal of one or several management board or supervisory board members,
the management board should be given the opportunity to stipulate a reasonable period in which to respond (the response time). The opportunity to
stipulate the response time should also apply to an intention as referred to above for judicial leave to call a general meeting pursuant to Section 2:110
of the Dutch Civil Code. The relevant shareholder should respect the response time stipulated by the management board, within the meaning of best
practice provision 4.1.7.”
If the Executive Board invokes a response time, such period shall not exceed 180 days from the moment the Executive Board is informed by one
or more shareholders of their intention to put an item on the agenda to the day of the general meeting at which the item is to be dealt with.
The Executive Board shall use the response time for further deliberation and constructive consultation. This shall be monitored by the Supervisory
Board. The response time shall be invoked only once for any given general meeting and shall not apply to an item in respect of which the response
time has been previously invoked.

Record date
For each AGM, the Company shall determine a record date for the exercise of the voting rights and participation in the meeting. The record date shall
be the 28th day prior to the date of the meeting. The record date shall be included in the convocation notice, as well as the manner in which those
entitled to attend and/or vote in the meeting can be registered and the manner in which they may exercise their rights.
Only persons who are shareholders on the record date may participate and vote in the AGM.

Participation in person, by proxy or through electronic communication
Each shareholder is entitled, either personally or by proxy authorised in writing, to attend the AGM, to address the meeting and to exercise his or her
voting rights.
The Executive Board may determine that the powers set out in the previous sentence may also be exercised by means of electronic communication.
If a shareholder wants to exercise his or her rights by proxy authorised in writing, the written power of attorney must be received by the Company no
later than on the date indicated for that purpose in the convocation notice. Through its corporate website, the Company generally facilitates that
shareholders can give electronic voting instructions.

by means of electronic communication remains entitled, whether or not represented by a holder of a written power of attorney, to participate in
the AGM.

Heineken N.V. Annual Report 2017

Corporate Governance Statement (continued)
Substantial shareholdings
Pursuant to the Financial Supervision Act (Wet op het financieel toezicht) and the Decree on Disclosure of Major Holdings and Capital Interests in
Issuing Institutions (Besluit melding zeggenschap en kapitaalbelang in uitgevende instellingen), the Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets
has been notified about the following substantial shareholdings regarding the Company during 2017:
Mrs. C.L. de Carvalho-Heineken (indirectly 50.005%; the direct 50.005% shareholder is Heineken Holding N.V.).
Voting Trust (FEMSA) (indirectly 8.63%; the direct 8.63% shareholder is CB Equity LLP). It is noted that in 2017 Voting Trust (FEMSA)’s indirect
shareholding in the Company has reduced from 12.53% to 8.63%.

Restrictions related to shares held by FEMSA
Upon completion (on 30 April 2010) of the acquisition of the beer operations of Fomento Económico Mexicano, S.A.B. de C.V. (FEMSA), CB Equity LLP
(belonging to the FEMSA group) received Heineken N.V. shares (and Heineken Holding N.V. shares). Pursuant to the Corporate Governance Agreement
of 30 April 2010 concluded between the Company, Heineken Holding N.V., L’Arche Green N.V., FEMSA and CB Equity LLP the following applies:
Subject to certain exceptions, FEMSA, CB Equity LLP, and any member of the FEMSA group shall not increase its shareholding in Heineken Holding N.V.
above 20% and shall not increase its holding in the Heineken Group above a maximum of 20% economic interest (such capped percentages referred
to as the ‘Voting Ownership Cap’).
Subject to certain exceptions, FEMSA, CB Equity LLP and any member of the FEMSA group may not exercise any voting rights in respect of any shares
beneficially owned by it, if and to the extent that such shares are in excess of the applicable Voting Ownership Cap.
Unless FEMSA’s economic interest in the Heineken Group were to fall below 14%, the current FEMSA control structure were to change or FEMSA were
to be subject to a change of control, FEMSA is entitled to have two representatives on the Company’s Supervisory Board, one of whom will be
Vice-Chairman, who also serves as the FEMSA representative on the Board of Directors of Heineken Holding N.V.

Share plans
There is a share-based Long-Term Variable Award (‘LTV’) for both the Executive Board members and senior management. Eligibility for participation
in the LTV by senior management is based on objective criteria.
Each year, performance shares are awarded to the participants. Depending on the fulfilment of certain predetermined performance conditions during
a three-year performance period, the performance shares will vest and the participants will receive Heineken N.V. shares.
Shares received by Executive Board members upon vesting under the LTV Award are subject to a holding period of five years as from the date of
award of the respective performance shares, which is approximately two years from the vesting date.
Under the Short-Term Variable Pay (STV) for the Executive Board, the Executive Board members are entitled to receive a cash bonus subject to the
fulfilment of predetermined performance conditions. The Executive Board members are obliged to invest at least 25% of their STV payout in Heineken
N.V. shares (investment shares) to be delivered by the Company; the maximum they can invest in Heineken N.V. shares is 50% of their STV payout (at
their discretion).
The investment shares (which are acquired by the Executive Board members in the year after the year over which the STV payout is calculated) are
subject to a holding period of five years as from 1 January of the year in which the investment shares are acquired. Executive Board members are
entitled to receive one additional Heineken N.V. share (a matching share) for each investment share held by them at the end of the respective holding
period. The entitlement to receive matching shares shall lapse upon the termination by the Company of the employment agreement (in respect of
Mr. Van Boxmeer), or service agreement (in respect of Mrs. Debroux), as the case may be, for an urgent reason (‘dringende reden’) within the meaning
of the law or in case of dismissal for cause (‘ontslag met gegronde redenen’) whereby the cause for dismissal concerns unsatisfactory functioning of
the Executive Board member.
In exceptional situations, extraordinary share entitlements may be awarded by the Executive Board to employees. These share entitlements are
usually non-performance-related and the employees involved are usually entitled to receive Heineken N.V. shares after the expiry of a period of time.
The shares required for the LTV, the STV and the extraordinary share entitlements will be acquired by the Company on the basis of an authorisation
granted by the AGM and subject to approval of the Supervisory Board of the Company.

Change of control
There are no important agreements to which the Company is a party and that will automatically come into force, be amended or be terminated under
the condition of a change of control over the Company as a result of a public offer.
However, the contractual conditions of most of the Company’s important financing agreements and notes issued (potentially) entitle the banks and
noteholders respectively to claim early repayment of the amounts borrowed by the Company in the situation of a change of control over the
Company (as defined in the respective agreement).
Also, some of HEINEKEN’s important joint venture agreements provide that in case of a change of control over HEINEKEN (as defined in the respective
agreement), the other party to such agreement may exercise its right to purchase HEINEKEN’s shares in the joint venture, as a result of which the
respective joint venture agreement will terminate.

Heineken N.V. Annual Report 2017

Corporate Governance Statement (continued)
Appointment and dismissal of Supervisory and Executive Board members
Members of the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board are appointed by the AGM on the basis of a non-binding nomination by the
Supervisory Board.
The AGM can dismiss members of the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board by a majority of the votes cast, if the subject majority at least
represents one-third of the issued capital.

Amendment of the Articles of Association
The Articles of Association can be amended by resolution of the AGM in which at least half of the issued capital is represented and exclusively either at
the proposal of the Supervisory Board or at the proposal of the Executive Board that has been approved by the Supervisory Board, or at the proposal
of one or more shareholders representing at least half of the issued capital.

Acquisition of own shares
On 20 April 2017, the AGM authorised the Executive Board (for the statutory maximum period of 18 months) to acquire own shares subject to the
following conditions and with due observance of the law and the Articles of Association (which require the approval of the Supervisory Board):
The maximum number of shares which may be acquired is 10% of the issued share capital of the Company.
Transactions must be executed at a price between the nominal value of the shares and 110% of the opening price quoted for the shares in the Official
Price List (Officiële Prijscourant) of Euronext Amsterdam on the date of the transaction or, in the absence of such a price, the latest price
quoted therein.
Transactions may be executed on the stock exchange or otherwise.
The authorisation may be used in connection with the variable awards for the members of the Executive Board and the LTV for senior management,
but may also serve other purposes, such as other acquisitions. A new authorisation will be submitted for approval at the next AGM on 19 April 2018.

Issue of shares
On 20 April 2017, the AGM also authorised the Executive Board (for a period of 18 months) to issue shares or grant rights to subscribe for shares and
to restrict or exclude shareholders’ pre-emption rights, with due observance of the law and Articles of Association (which require the approval of the
Supervisory Board). The authorisation is limited to 10% of the Company’s issued share capital, as per the date of issue. The authorisation may be used
in connection with the LTV for the members of the Executive Board and the LTV for senior management, but may also serve other purposes, such as
acquisitions. A new authorisation will be submitted for approval to the AGM at 19 April 2018.

Compliance with the Code
On 8 December 2016, a new Code was published which came into effect on 1 January 2017. The Code can be downloaded at http://www.mccg.nl.
As stated in the Code, there should be a basic recognition that corporate governance must be tailored to the company-specific situation and therefore
that non-application of individual provisions by a company may be justified.
HEINEKEN in principle endorses the Code’s principles and applies virtually all best practice provisions. However, given the structure of the HEINEKEN
Group, and specifically the relationship between the Company and its controlling shareholder Heineken Holding N.V., the Company does not (fully)
apply the following best practice provisions:
2.1.7, 2.1.8, 2.1.10 and 2.3.4:
Number of independent Supervisory Board members as well as number of independent members of the Remuneration and Selection & Appointment
Committees; in that light the Supervisory Board report does not state that best practice provision 2.1.7 through 2.1.9 has been fulfilled.
2.2.2:
Maximum terms of appointment Supervisory Board members; and
2.3.8:
Temporary nature of appointing a delegated Supervisory Board member.
Furthermore, HEINEKEN does not fully apply best practice provision 3.2.3 (severance payment Executive Board members and notably the one-year
salary limit for such payments) to Mr. Van Boxmeer, in view of his longstanding employment relationship (over 25 years in service) with the Company.
The agreement with Mrs. Debroux was made in line with the best practice provisions of the 2008 Dutch Corporate Governance Code. Under the 2016
Code, the requirements regarding severance payments are more stringent and as such the Company strictly speaking does not comply with this best
practice provision 3.2.3 during her first term (ending in April 2019). The Company shall comply with it in any subsequent terms after April 2019.
For more information please see the Remuneration Report.

Statement of the Executive Board
The Report of the Executive Board, together with pages 133–154 of the Sustainability Review, serves as the management report for the purpose of
section 391, Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.
In accordance with best practice provision 1.4.3 of the Code, we are of the opinion that, in respect of financial reporting risks, the internal risk management
and control system, as described in the Risk Management section of this Annual Report 2017:
Provides sufficient insights into any failings in the effectiveness of the internal risk management and control systems;
The aforementioned systems provide reasonable assurance that the financial reporting does not contain any material inaccuracies in the design and
operation of the internal risk management and control systems during the past financial year;
Based on the current state of affairs, it is justified that the financial reporting is prepared on a going concern basis; and
The report states those material risks and uncertainties that are relevant to the expectation of the Company’s continuity for the period of 12 months
after the preparation of the report.
It should be noted that the foregoing does not imply that this system and these procedures provide absolute assurance as to the realisation of operational
and strategic business objectives, or that they can prevent all misstatements, inaccuracies, errors, fraud and non-compliance with legislation, rules and
regulations. For a detailed description of the risk management system and the principal risks identified, please refer to the Risk Management section.
In accordance with Article 5:25c paragraph 2 sub c of the Financial Markets Supervision Act, we confirm that, to the best of our knowledge, the
financial statements in this Annual Report 2017 give a true and fair view of our assets and liabilities, our financial position at 31 December 2017,
and the results of our consolidated operations for the financial year 2017; and
the Report of the Executive Board includes a fair review of the position at 31 December 2017 and the development and performance during the
financial year 2017 of Heineken N.V. and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, and describes the principal risks that
Heineken N.V. faces.
This statement cannot be construed as a statement in accordance with the requirements of Section 404 of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which Act
is not applicable to Heineken N.V.

Heineken N.V. Annual Report 2017

To the Shareholders
During the year under review, the Supervisory Board performed its duties in accordance with primary and
secondary legislation and the Articles of Association of Heineken N.V. and supervised and advised the
Executive Board on an ongoing basis.
Financial statements and profit appropriation
The Supervisory Board hereby submits to the shareholders the financial statements and the report of the Executive Board for the financial year 2017,
as prepared by the Executive Board and approved by the Supervisory Board in its meeting of 9 February 2018. Deloitte Accountants B.V. audited the
financial statements. Its report can be found on page 156 in the Other Information section.
The Supervisory Board recommends that shareholders, in accordance with the Articles of Association, adopt these financial statements and, as proposed
by the Executive Board, appropriate €838 million for payment of dividend. The underlying principle of the dividend policy is that 30-40% of net
profit before exceptional items and amortisation of acquisition-related intangible assets (net profit beia) is placed at the disposal of shareholders for
distribution as dividend. The proposed dividend amounts to €1.47 per share of €1.60 nominal value, of which €0.54 was paid as an interim dividend on
10 August 2017.

Heineken N.V. Annual Report 2017

To the Shareholders (continued)
The Supervisory Board has a diverse composition in terms of experience, gender, nationality and age. Three out of 10 members are women and six
out of 10 members are non-Dutch. There are five nationalities (American, Belgian, British, Dutch and Mexican) and age ranges between 46 and 73.
The Supervisory Board is of the opinion that a diversity of experience and skills is represented on its board. The elements of a diverse composition of
the Supervisory Board are laid down in the Diversity Policy of the Supervisory Board, Executive Board and Executive Team as per best practice provision
2.1.5 of the revised Dutch Corporate Governance Code, which was published on 8 December 2016 and which came into effect on 1 January 2017
(the ‘Code’).
In line with Dutch law, the profile of the Supervisory Board and the Diversity Policy state that the Supervisory Board shall pursue that at least 30% of the
seats shall be held by men and at least 30% by women. Currently, 30% (i.e. three out of 10) of the Supervisory Board members are female and it is
therefore deemed to be balanced within the meaning of Dutch law. Diversity and gender are important drivers in the selection process. With reference
thereto, the Supervisory Board will retain an active and open attitude as regards selecting female candidates, and has established a list of potential
female candidates who will be considered should a vacancy in the Supervisory Board arise. The Supervisory Board however also notes that, in its
opinion, gender is only one element of diversity, and that experience, background, knowledge, skills and insight are equally important and relevant
criteria in selecting new members.
Mr. J.A. Fernández Carbajal, Mr. J.G. Astaburuaga Sanjinés, Mr. J.M. Huët and Mrs. A.M. Fentener van Vlissingen will have completed their four year
appointment terms per the end of the AGM on 19 April 2018. Mr. Huët is eligible for reappointment for a period of four years and a non-binding
nomination shall be submitted to the AGM in that respect. A non-binding nomination for the reappointment of Mr. Fernández Carbajal and Mr.
Astaburuaga Sanjinés for a period of four years shall also be submitted to the AGM. Both are representatives of FEMSA (that (in)directly holds a
14.76% economic interest in the Company), and their respective appointments are based on the Corporate Governance Agreement, which was
concluded between (among others) the Company and FEMSA on 30 April 2010, and which was approved by the AGM on 22 April 2010 (in connection
with the acquisition by the Company of FEMSA’s beer activities). A reappointment of Mr. Fernández Carbajal and Mr. Astaburuaga Sanjinés for a period
of four years is a deviation of the applicable two-year appointment term as per best practice provision 2.2.2. of the Code, it is however deemed to be in
line with the profile of the Supervisory Board and a reflection of FEMSA’s involvement as a long-term shareholder of the Company.
The Supervisory Board is grateful for the commitment of Mrs. Fentener van Vlissingen over the past 12 years and for the way she contributed to the
Supervisory Board, as well as its Audit Committee and Selection & Appointment Committee.
A non-binding nomination will be submitted to the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders in 2018 to appoint Mrs. Marion Helmes as member
of the Supervisory Board as of 19 April 2018 for a period of four years. It is the intention that Mrs. Helmes will join the Audit Committee and in time
become the Chair of the Audit Committee, taking over this role from Mr. Huët who will remain a member of the Audit Committee.

Independence
The Supervisory Board endorses the principle that the composition of the Supervisory Board shall be such that its members are able to act critically
and independently of one another and of the Executive Board and any particular interests.
Given the structure of the Heineken Group, the Company is of the opinion that, in the context of preserving the continuity of the Heineken Group
and ensuring a focus on long-term value creation, it is in its best interest and that of its stakeholders that the Supervisory Board includes a fair and
adequate representation of persons who are related by blood or marriage to the late Mr. A.H. Heineken (former Chairman of the Executive Board),
or who are members of the Board of Directors of Heineken Holding N.V., even if those persons would not, formally speaking, be considered
‘independent’ within the meaning of best practice provision 2.1.8 of the Code.
Currently, the majority of the Supervisory Board (i.e. six of its 10 members) qualify as ‘independent’ as per best practice provision 2.1.8 of the
Code. There are four members whom in a strictly formal sense do not meet the applicable criteria for being ‘independent’ as set out in the Code:
Mr. de Carvalho (who is the spouse of Mrs. C.L. de Carvalho – Heineken, the daughter of the late Mr. A.H. Heineken, and also an executive director of
Heineken Holding N.V.), Mr. Das (who is the Chairman of Heineken Holding N.V.), Mr. Fernández Carbajal (who is a non-executive director of Heineken
Holding N.V. and representative of FEMSA) and Mr. Astaburuaga Sanjinés (who is a representative of FEMSA). However, the Supervisory Board has
ascertained that Mr. de Carvalho, Mr. Das, Mr. Fernández Carbajal and Mr. Astaburuaga Sanjinés in fact act critically and independently.

Remuneration
The AGM determines the remuneration of the members of the Supervisory Board. In 2011, the AGM resolved to adjust the remuneration of the
Supervisory Board effective 1 January 2011. The detailed amounts are stated in the notes to the financial statements.

Meetings and activities of the Supervisory Board
During 2017, the Supervisory Board held seven meetings with the Executive Board. The agenda regularly included subjects such as the development
of and the manner in which the Executive Board implements the Company’s strategy aimed at long-term value creation, as well as enabling Company
culture aiming to ensuring proper monitoring by the Supervisory Board, its financial position, the results of the Regions and Operating Companies,
acquisitions, large investment proposals, the yearly budget, management changes, the new Dutch Corporate Governance Code and the internal risk
management and control system. The external auditor attended the meeting in which the annual results were discussed. In 2017, specific attention
was given to the following:
The Supervisory Board had a two-day meeting with the Executive Board to discuss the Company’s strategic priorities and main risks of the business
associated with it in depth. During this meeting, members of the Executive Team presented their respective strategic topics and risks per region or
function, as the case may be.
The Supervisory Board visited London, the United Kingdom, where the Managing Directors of Heineken UK, Heineken Italy and the Europe Region
presented an update on business performance. In addition, a visit was made to the Google UK offices and the Mars Slough factory.
During the year, several representatives of senior management and the Executive Team were invited to give presentations to the Supervisory Board.
In 2017, the following subjects were presented in more detail:
––Sustainability
––Digital Commerce
––Human Resources and succession planning (including the remuneration of the members of the Executive Team)
––Global Information Systems, including Cyber Security
Regular Executive Sessions were held without the Executive Board being present. The purpose of these sessions was to evaluate the Supervisory Board
meetings and, where relevant, further reflect on particular subjects discussed at the meetings. One Executive Session was dedicated to the evaluation
of the Supervisory Board relating to the performance, working methods, procedures and functioning of the Supervisory Board, its committees and its
individual members as well as the functioning of the Executive Board and its individual members. These evaluations were conducted on the basis of
responses to a questionnaire submitted by the members of the Supervisory Board to the Chairman followed by individual interviews with the Chairman.
The questionnaire and discussions with the Chairman covered topics such as the composition and expertise of the Supervisory Board, access to
information, frequency and quality of the meetings, quality and timeliness of the meeting materials, and the nature of the topics discussed during
meetings. The responses provided by the Supervisory Board members indicated that the Board continues to be a well-functioning team.
The Chairman of the Supervisory Board met frequently with the CEO to, among others, prepare the Supervisory Board meetings.

Committees
The Supervisory Board has five Committees: the Preparatory Committee, the Audit Committee, the Selection & Appointment Committee, the
Remuneration Committee and the Americas Committee. The terms of reference for the Committees are posted on the Company’s website.
Preparatory Committee
Composition: Mr. Wijers (Chairman), Mr. de Carvalho, Mr. Das and Mr. Fernández Carbajal. The Preparatory Committee met seven times.
The Committee prepares decision-making by the Supervisory Board on matters not already handled by any of the other Committees, such as
in relation to acquisitions and investments.
Audit Committee
Composition: Mr. Huët (Chairman), Mr. Astaburuaga Sanjinés, and Mrs. Fentener van Vlissingen. The Audit Committee met four times. The members
collectively have the experience and financial expertise to supervise the Executive Board in its activities in relation to the publication of financial
statements and operation of the internal risk management and control systems, including the risk profile of Heineken N.V.
The Executive Board attended all meetings, and so did the external auditor, the Executive Director Global Audit, and the Senior Director Global
Accounting and Reporting.
The Executive Director Global Audit has direct access to the Audit Committee, primarily through its Chairman. During the year, the Audit Committee
met once with the external auditors and once with the Executive Director Global Audit, in both instances without management being present.
In addition, the Chairman of the Audit Committee and the Executive Director Global Audit held regular update meetings during the year.

Remuneration Committee
Composition: Mr. Das (Chairman), Mr. de Carvalho, Mr. Wijers and Ms. Brunini. The Remuneration Committee met four times in 2017.
The Remuneration Committee discussed the new Code and in particular the best practice provisions related to remuneration, including the pay ratio
within the Company.
The Committee made recommendations to the Supervisory Board on 2017 target setting and 2016 payout levels for the STV pay and LTV awards to
the Executive Board, all of which were endorsed by the Supervisory Board. As part of the recommendations the Remuneration Committee took note
of the Executive Board member’s views with regard to the amount and structure of their own remuneration.
The Remuneration Committee received a report on status and trends in executive remuneration and executive remuneration governance in order to
fulfil its remuneration governance responsibilities. The report aimed to review, amongst other things, alignment of HEINEKEN’s remuneration practices
with its remuneration principles, to provide an overview of HEINEKEN’s competitive remuneration positioning versus the market, to assess the relation
between actual remuneration and performance and to update the Committee on executive compensation trends and regulatory development.
A copy of the report was also submitted to the full Supervisory Board.
In addition, a review was performed on the Executive Board Remuneration Policy as well as the Supervisory Board fees and recent developments were
discussed in light of the new Code and the European Shareholders Rights Directive.

To the Shareholders (continued)
Executive Board composition and remuneration
Composition
Best practice provision 2.2.1 of the Code recommends that an Executive Board member is appointed for a period of four years and that a member
may be reappointed for a term of not more than four years at a time. In compliance with this best practice provision, the Supervisory Board has drawn
up a rotation schedule in order to avoid, as far as possible, a situation in which Executive Board members retire at the same time.
Mr. Jean-François van Boxmeer was initially appointed for an indefinite term in 2001 and was reappointed for a period of four years in 2017.
Mrs. Laurence Debroux was appointed in 2015 for a period of four years.
Pursuant to Dutch law, the Supervisory Board shall pursue that on the Executive Board at least 30% of the seats shall be held by men and at least 30%
by women. The current composition of the Executive Board is compliant with this target. HEINEKEN also strives to appoint a well-balanced mix of men
and women to its senior management. We note that there may be various pragmatic reasons – such as other relevant selection criteria and the
availability of suitable candidates – that could play a complicating role in achieving a well-balanced mix of men and women to its senior
management, at least in the short term.
Remuneration
The AGM approved the current remuneration policy for the Executive Board in 2011 and 2014, respectively. Details of the policy and its implementation
are described in the Remuneration Report.
Appreciation
The Supervisory Board wishes to express its gratitude to the members of the Executive Board and all HEINEKEN employees for their hard work and
dedication in 2017.

Heineken N.V. Annual Report 2017

Remuneration Report
The Executive Board remuneration policy reflects our longstanding remuneration principles of
supporting the business strategy, paying for performance, and paying competitively and fairly.
The remuneration policy and underlying principles continue to support our business growth in the
widely diverse markets in which we operate.
For 2017, the Remuneration Committee and Supervisory Board reviewed the Executive Board remuneration policy versus its implementation, and its
outcome versus performance. With regard to policy, the Supervisory Board decided not to recommend any policy change to the 2018 Annual General
Meeting of Shareholders. With regard to implementation, the Supervisory Board decided to realign the Executive Board base salaries with the aspired
policy levels, to adjust the relative weights of the financial and operational measures within the Short-term variable pay plan, and to change the name
of one of the measures in the Short-term and Long-term variable pay plans.
This Remuneration Report includes three sections:
Part I
Describes the prevailing Executive Board remuneration policy, as it was adopted by the AGM in 2011, and as it has been implemented in 2017 and
will be implemented in 2018.
Part II
Provides details of the Executive Board actual remuneration for performance ending in, or at year-end, 2017.
Part III
Outlines adjustments to the Executive Board remuneration policy and implementation for 2018.

Part I – Executive Board remuneration policy
Remuneration principles
The Executive Board remuneration policy is designed to meet four key principles:
Support the business strategy
We align our remuneration policy with business strategies focused on creating long-term growth and shareholder value, while maintaining a tight
focus on short-term financial results.
Pay for performance
We set clear and measurable targets for our short-term variable pay and long-term variable award policies, and we pay higher remuneration when
targets are exceeded and lower remuneration when targets are not met.
Pay competitively
We set target remuneration to be competitive with other relevant multinational corporations of similar size and complexity.
Pay fairly
We set target remuneration to be internally consistent and fair; we regularly review internal pay relativities between the Executive Board and senior
managers and aim to achieve consistency and alignment where possible.

validates the peer group to ensure relevance, and recommends adjustments to the Supervisory Board if needed. For 2017, the peer group consisted
of the following companies:
Anheuser-Busch InBev (BE)

Diageo (UK)

Nestlé (CH)

Carlsberg (DK)

Henkel (DE)

Heineken N.V. Annual Report 2017

Remuneration Report (continued)
The change for 2017 involved the replacement of Philips and SABMiller by Nestlé. Philips has been removed from the labour market peer group due to
the divestment of its lighting business, thus leaving two smaller entities that are fairly remote from HEINEKEN industry-wise, and SABMiller has been
removed due to its acquisition by Anheuser-Busch Inbev. As replacement, the Supervisory Board has decided to include Nestlé in the labour market
peer group.

Base salary
Base salaries are determined by reference to the median base salary levels of the aforementioned labour market peer group. Every year, peer group
and base salary levels are reviewed, and the Remuneration Committee may propose adjustments to the Supervisory Board taking into account the
external labour market peer group data and internal pay relativities. The annual base salaries for 2017 were €1,200,000 for the CEO, and €720,000
for the CFO. For 2018 these base salary levels will be increased to €1,250,000 for the CEO and €735,000 for the CFO respectively, to realign these base
salaries with the aspired policy levels following from the medians of the aforementioned Labour market peer group.

Short-term variable pay
The short-term variable pay (STV) is designed to drive and reward the achievements of HEINEKEN’s annual performance targets. Through its payout
in both cash and investment shares it also drives and rewards sound business decisions for HEINEKEN’s long-term health while aligning Executive
Board and shareholder interests at the same time. The target STV opportunities for both 2017 and 2018 are 140% of base salary for the CEO and
100% of base salary for the CFO. These percentage opportunities are well aligned with the labour market peer group medians.
The STV opportunities are for a weighted 75% based on financial and operational measures for Heineken N.V., and for a weighted 25% on individual
leadership measures. At the beginning of each year, the Supervisory Board establishes the performance measures, their relative weights and
corresponding targets based on HEINEKEN’s business priorities for that year. The financial and operational measures and their relative weights
are reported in the Remuneration Report upfront; the numerical performance targets themselves are not disclosed as they are considered to be
commercially sensitive. In the first weeks of the following year, the Supervisory Board reviews the Company and individual performance against the
pre-set targets, and approves the STV payout levels based on the performance achieved. The performance on each of the measures is reported
in qualitative terms in the Remuneration Report after the end of the performance period (cf. Part II). The STV payout for 2017 is subject to four
performance measures with equal weights of 25% each: Organic Revenue Growth, Organic Net Profit beia Growth, Free Operating Cash Flow
and Individual Leadership measures. For 2018 the same performance measures will apply, yet with adjusted weights of 35%, 15%, 25% and 25%
respectively, to further increase focus on top line growth. In addition, as from 2018 the name of the 2017 Organic Revenue Growth performance
measure will be changed into Organic Net Revenue Growth, since IFRS has changed the definition of ‘Revenue’ to include certain types of excise duties
whereas we wish to maintain the performance measure net of excise duties and thus unchanged in its content.
For each performance measure, a threshold, target and maximum performance level is set with the following STV payout, as a percentage
of target payout:
Threshold performance
50% of target payout
Target performance
100% of target payout
Maximum performance
200% of target payout.
For each measure, payout in between these performance levels is on a straight-line basis; below threshold performance the payout is zero, whereas
beyond maximum performance it is capped at 200% of payout at target.
In line with policy, 25% of the STV payout is paid out in shares, referred to as investment shares. At their discretion, the Executive Board members have
the opportunity to indicate before the end of the performance year whether they wish to receive up to another 25% of their STV payout in additional
investment shares. All investment shares thus received are then blocked and cannot be sold under any circumstance, including resignation, for five
calendar years to link the value of the investment shares to long-term Company performance. Withholding tax on the investment shares and on the
cash part of the STV payout is settled with the cash part at the time of payout. After the blocking period is completed after five calendar years, the
Company will match the investment shares 1:1 in the first weeks of the following year, i.e. one matching share is granted for each investment share. As
from then, there are no holding requirements on these investment shares anymore, and there are no holding requirements on the resulting matching
shares that remain after withholding tax on these shares. According to plan rules, matching entitlements will be forfeited in case of dismissal by the
Company for an urgent reason within the meaning of the law (‘dringende reden’), or in case of dismissal for cause (‘gegronde reden’) whereby the
cause for dismissal concerns unsatisfactory functioning of the Executive Board member. With this ‘deferral-and-matching’ proposition a significant
share ownership by the Executive Board is ensured, creating an increased alignment with the interests of shareholders. The Supervisory Board has the
power to revise the amount of the STV payout to an appropriate amount if the STV payout that would have been payable in accordance with the
agreed payment schedule would be unacceptable according to standards of reasonableness and fairness. The Supervisory Board is entitled to claw
back all or part of the STV payout (in cash, investment shares or matching shares) insofar as it has been made on the basis of incorrect information
about achieving the performance conditions.

Heineken N.V. Annual Report 2017

Remuneration Report (continued)
Long-term variable award
The long-term variable award (LTV) is designed to drive and reward sound business decisions for HEINEKEN’s long-term health, and to align the
Executive Board with shareholder interests. The target LTV opportunities for both 2017 and 2018 are 150% of base salary for the CEO and 125% of
base salary for the CFO.
Each year, a target number of performance shares is conditionally granted based on the aforementioned target LTV opportunity percentage of
that year, the base salary of that year, and the closing share price of 31 December of the preceding year. The vesting of these performance shares is
contingent on HEINEKEN’s performance over a period of three years on four fundamental financial performance measures:
Organic Revenue Growth
To drive top line growth
Organic Operating Profit beia Growth
To drive profitability and operational efficiency
Earnings Per Share (EPS) beia Growth
To drive overall long-term Company performance
Free Operating Cash Flow
To drive focus on cash.
These four performance measures have equal weights to minimise the risk that participants over-emphasise one performance measure to the
detriment of others. At the beginning of each performance period, the Supervisory Board establishes the corresponding numerical targets for these
performance measures based on HEINEKEN’s business priorities. These targets are not disclosed upfront as they are considered to be commercially
sensitive. In the first weeks after the end of the performance period, the Supervisory Board reviews the Company’s performance against the pre-set
targets, and approves the LTV vesting based on the performance achieved. The performance on each of the measures is reported in qualitative terms
in the Remuneration Report after the performance period has been completed (cf. Part II).
For each performance measure, a threshold, target and maximum performance level is set with the following performance share vesting schedule:
Threshold performance
50% of performance shares vests
Target performance
100% of performance shares vests
Maximum performance
200% of performance shares vests.
For each measure, vesting in between these performance levels is on a straight-line basis; below threshold performance the vesting is zero, whereas
beyond maximum performance it is capped at 200% of vesting at target.
The Supervisory Board has the power to revise the amount of performance shares that will vest to an appropriate number if the number of
performance shares that would have vested under the agreed vesting schedule would be unacceptable according to standards of reasonableness
and fairness. The Supervisory Board is entitled to claw back all or part of the shares transferred to the Executive Board members upon vesting (or the
value thereof) insofar as vesting occurred on the basis of incorrect information about achieving the performance conditions. The vested performance
shares that remain after withholding tax are subject to an additional holding restriction of two years, to arrive at a five-year holding restriction after the
date of the conditional performance grant.
As from the 2017 grant, the performance measure ‘Organic Operating Profit beia Growth’ replaced the performance measure ‘Organic EBIT beia
Growth’, as approved by the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on 20 April 2017. For the LTV grants for the performance period 2015-2017
and the performance period 2016-2018 the original EBIT targets remained in place. As from 2018 the name of the 2017 Organic Revenue Growth
performance measure will be changed into Organic Net Revenue Growth, since IFRS has changed the definition of ‘Revenue’ to include certain types
of excise duties whereas we wish to maintain the performance measure net of excise duties and thus unchanged in its content.

Pay mix
The mix between fixed pay and variable pay for various levels of performance is illustrated overleaf. In these charts, fixed pay refers to base salary only,
excluding pensions and other emoluments, and variable pay consists of the aforementioned short-term variable pay and long-term variable award
opportunities, including the ‘deferral-and-matching’ proposition. Share price movements during performance and holding periods are hereby not
included since these are unknown in the context of target remuneration.

Pensions
The members of the Executive Board participate in a defined-contribution Capital Creation Plan. As of 2015, following pension reforms in the
Netherlands, new members of the Executive Board receive the same contribution as new top executives under Dutch employment contract below
the Executive Board, which is currently 18% of base salary. This applies to our current CFO who became an Executive Board member in 2015. For the
CEO the same capital creation arrangement as for 2014 remained in force, since the existing top executives below the Executive Board at that time
were compensated on an individual basis for the impact of the aforementioned pension reforms. The contribution to the CEO therefore remains an
age-dependent percentage of base salary and STV payout. Both Executive Board members have chosen to receive their full pension contributions
as taxable income, as opposed to applying tax deferral to the maximum amount possible.

Compensation rights on termination of employment/service agreement
If the Company gives notice of termination of the employment agreement of Mr. Van Boxmeer for a reason which is not an urgent reason (‘dringende
reden’) within the meaning of the law, the Company shall pay severance compensation to Mr. Van Boxmeer on expiry of his employment agreement.
This severance compensation shall be set on the basis of the notion of reasonableness taking into account all the circumstances of the matter, including
whether Mr. Van Boxmeer shall be bound by a non-competition obligation and whether any allowance is paid by the Company in relation to this
non-competition obligation. In case of dismissal for cause (‘ontslag met gegronde reden’) whereby the cause for dismissal concerns unsatisfactory
functioning of Mr. Van Boxmeer, the severance compensation cannot exceed one year’s base salary.
If the Company gives notice of termination of the service agreement of Mrs. Debroux for a reason which is not an urgent reason (‘dringende reden’)
within the meaning of the law, or decides not to extend the service agreement upon its expiry, or if the AGM does not re-appoint Mrs. Debroux
as member of the Executive Board for a subsequent term, the Company shall pay Mrs. Debroux an amount equal to two years of base salary (in
the event of termination during or upon expiry of Mrs. Debroux’s first four-year term), or an amount equal to one year base salary (in the event of
termination during or upon expiry of any subsequent term), respectively. This agreement with Mrs. Debroux was made in line with the best practice
provisions of the 2008 Dutch Corporate Governance Code. Under the revised 2016 Code, the requirements regarding severance payments are more
stringent and as such the Company does not, strictly speaking, comply with best practice provision 3.2.3 during her first term (ending in April 2019).
The Company shall comply with the requirements in any subsequent terms after April 2019.

Loans
HEINEKEN does not provide loans to the members of the Executive Board.

ad (2) – 2017 Short-term variable pay
The 2017 Short-term variable pay (STV) relates to the performance year 2017, and becomes payable in 2018. The STV pay for 2017 was subject to
four performance measures: Organic Revenue Growth, Organic Net Profit beia Growth, Free Operating Cash Flow and Individual leadership measures,
each with a weight of 25%. The Supervisory Board determined the results against the pre-set targets on these measures as follows:
Organic Revenue Growth
between target and maximum performance
Organic Net Profit beia Growth
at maximum performance
Free Operating Cash Flow
at maximum performance
Individual leadership measures
between target and maximum performance
The resulting STV payout for 2017 is close to 163% of payout at target level for both members of the Executive Board. In line with policy, 25% of the
STV payout is paid out in investment shares against the closing share price of 12 February 2018, the publication date of these financial statements.
In addition, the Executive Board members have had the opportunity to indicate before the end of the 2017 performance year whether they wished
to receive up to another 25% of their STV payout in additional investment shares; for 2017 the Executive Board members did not elect to receive
additional investment shares beyond the mandatory 25% share investment. The investment shares are restricted for sale for five calendar years,
after which they are matched 1:1 by matching shares. Revision and clawback provisions apply to this award, including the related matching share
entitlement. The table below provides an overview of the investment shares at year-end that were awarded as part of STV payouts in the past, and
that have remained blocked and await 1:1 matching by the Company, provided the conditions thereto are met. Only when the holding period of the
investment shares has been completed, will the matching share entitlements be converted into shares and transferred to the recipient.

ad (3) – 2015-2017 Long-term variable award: number of performance shares vesting
The 2015-2017 Long-term variable award (LTV) relates to the performance period 2015-2017 and vests shortly after 12 February 2018, the
publication date of these financial statements. The vesting of the LTV award for performance period 2015-2017 is subject to Heineken N.V.
performance on four financial measures with equal weights. The Supervisory Board determined the results against the pre-set targets as follows:
Organic Revenue Growth
between target and maximum performance
Organic EBIT beia Growth
between target and maximum performance
Earnings Per Share (EPS) beia Growth
at maximum performance
Free Operating Cash Flow
between target and maximum performance.
As a result, the vesting of the LTV grant for performance period 2015-2017 will be equal to 163% of the vesting at target level. For the CEO this plan
performance implies that 47,699 shares will vest shortly after 12 February 2018, as a result of the 29,263 conditional performance shares granted to
him in 2015. For the CFO this plan performance implies that 19,327 shares will vest shortly after 12 February 2018, as a result of the 11,857 conditional
performance shares granted to her in 2015. The resulting share awards are defined in before-tax terms (i.e. before deduction of withholding tax due);
the actual net shares awarded (i.e. after withholding tax due) remain blocked for an additional period of two years until 12 February 2020, also in case
of resignation during that period. Revision and clawback provisions apply to this award. The table below provides an overview of outstanding LTV
awards (awards granted but not yet vested, or awards vested but still blocked) as of 31 December 2017.

Remuneration Report (continued)
Actual remuneration paid to former members of the Executive Board
The resignation per 1 May 2015 of the former CFO Mr. Hooft Graafland has been considered a retirement under the LTV Plan Rules. Existing
agreements from 2005 for a specific group of senior managers (including the Executive Board members at the time) to compensate for the negative
effects of a structural change in their variable pay plan designs, implied that unvested LTV awards as of his retirement date would continue to be
subject to vesting at their regular vesting dates, insofar and to the extent that the predetermined performance conditions are met. Shares that may
vest under these plans will be subject to a holding period of two years in accordance with the LTV Plan Rules, to arrive at a five-year holding restriction
after the date of the conditional performance grant. For Mr. Hooft Graafland this involved the three Long-term variable award plans over performance
years 2013-2015, 2014-2016 and 2015-2017 respectively. In the previous two years the remuneration related to the vesting of the former two
plans has been disclosed. Following year-end 2017 the 2015-2017 plan has vested with a performance of 163% as mentioned under ‘ad (3)’ above,
implying a vesting of 22,467 shares for Mr. Hooft Graafland and, given an end-of-year share price of €86.93, a value of €1,953,056. This concludes all
remuneration to Mr. Hooft Graafland following his retirement.

Pay Ratio
In the Netherlands a revised corporate governance code has come into effect as of financial year 2017. This revised code requires Dutch stock-listed
companies to consider pay ratios between Executive Board members and other employees within the Company when formulating the remuneration
policy for the Executive Board, and to disclose these ratios in the Remuneration Report every year.
As is commonly understood, such ratios are specific to the company’s industry, geographical footprint and organisational model. HEINEKEN has a
truly wide geographical footprint, with the majority of its business and employees in emerging markets with widely different pay levels and structures
compared to the Netherlands and Europe. In addition, HEINEKEN has a large number of breweries and sales forces in-house worldwide, which adds
to the variety of pay within the Company. For other companies in other industries this will be different. Finally, pay ratios can also be quite volatile over
time, as they can vary with exchange rate movements and can be very dependent on the Company’s annual performance since that performance
impacts the remuneration of the Executive Board much more than of all other employees.
The 2017 pay ratios for HEINEKEN are 215 for the CEO and 100 for the CFO. These ratios are obtained by dividing the 2017 total remuneration for
the CEO and CFO by the 2017 average total remuneration of all other employees worldwide. The common denominator of these ratios is derived
from note 10 on page 87 by dividing the 2017 total personnel expense (after subtracting the expense for contractors and for the Executive Board’s
remuneration), by the reported FTE (minus two; excluding contractors), leading to an amount of €42,074. The total remuneration for the CEO and
CFO is retrieved from note 33 on page 119. The reason why the Executive Board’s remuneration is obtained from note 33 rather than from this
Remuneration Report is explained by the fact that the personnel expense in note 10 is based on IFRS valuation standards, which implies that the
Executive Board’s remuneration also needs to be based on these standards for reasons of comparability.

Part III – Adjustments to the Executive Board remuneration policy and implementation for 2018
Policy changes
The Supervisory Board reviewed the remuneration policy and decided not to submit any changes for approval to the 2018 Annual General Meeting
of Shareholders.

Implementation changes
The Supervisory Board also reviewed the remuneration policy versus its implementation and decided to implement the following changes as from
2018 onwards.
––The Executive Board base salaries will be increased from €1,200,000 to €1,250,000 for the CEO and from €720,000 to €735,000 for the CFO, to
realign these base salaries with the aspired policy levels following from the medians of the Labour market peer group.
––The relative weights of the financial and operational measures within the Short-term variable pay plan will change from 25% to 35% for Organic
Revenue Growth, to further increase focus on top line growth, and from 25% to 15% for Organic Net Profit beia Growth; the relative weights for Free
Operating Cash flow and the Individual leadership objectives will remain the same at 25% each.
––The name of the 2017 Organic Revenue Growth performance measure within the Short-term and Long-term variable pay plans will be changed
into Organic Net Revenue Growth, since IFRS has changed the definition of ‘Revenue’ to include certain types of excise duties whereas we wish to
maintain the performance measure net of excise duties and thus unchanged in its content.

Heineken N.V. Annual Report 2017

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

1. Reporting entity
Heineken N.V. (the ‘Company’) is a company domiciled in the Netherlands. The address of the Company’s registered office is Tweede
Weteringplantsoen 21, Amsterdam. The consolidated financial statements of the Company as at and for the year ended 31 December
2017 comprise the Company, its subsidiaries (together referred to as ‘HEINEKEN’) and HEINEKEN’s interest in joint ventures and associates.
The Company is registered in the Trade Register of Amsterdam No. 33011433. HEINEKEN is primarily involved in the brewing and selling of beer
and cider. Led by the Heineken® brand, HEINEKEN has a portfolio of more than 300 international, regional, local and speciality beers and ciders.

2. Basis of preparation
(a) Statement of compliance
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as endorsed
by the European Union (EU) and also comply with the financial reporting requirements included in Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.
All standards and interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the International Financial Reporting
Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) effective year-end 2017 have been adopted by the EU. Consequently, the accounting policies applied by the
Company also comply fully with IFRS as issued by the IASB.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Executive Board of the Company and authorised for issue on 9 February 2018
and will be submitted for adoption to the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on 19 April 2018.

(b) Basis of measurement
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis unless otherwise indicated. The methods used to measure
fair values are discussed further in notes 3 and 4.

(c) Functional and presentation currency
These consolidated financial statements are presented in Euro, which is the Company’s functional currency. All financial information presented in
Euro has been rounded to the nearest million unless stated otherwise.

(d) Use of estimates and judgements
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and
assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which
the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.
Information about assumptions and estimation uncertainties and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most
significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements are described in the following notes and related
accounting policies:
Note 5 Operating segments, particularly the estimation of discount accruals in revenue at the end of the year based on the individual
customer agreements.
Note 6 Acquisitions and disposals of subsidiaries, particularly with regard to the identification and valuation of acquired assets and liabilities.
Note 15 Intangible assets, particularly the assumptions used in goodwill impairment testing.
Note 18 Deferred tax assets and liabilities, particularly with regard to the assessment of the recoverability of past tax losses.
Note 26 Employee benefits, particularly with regard to assumptions for discount rates, future pension increases and life expectancy to calculate the
defined benefit obligation.
Note 28 Provisions and note 32 Contingencies, particularly with regard to estimating the likelihood and timing of potential cash outflows relating
to claims and litigations.
Note 29 Trade and other payables, particularly with regard to the estimation of circulation times and market losses in determining the returnable
packaging deposit liability.
Note 30 Financial risk management and financial instruments, particularly with regard to the estimation of the recoverability of loans and
advances to customers and trade receivables.

Heineken N.V. Annual Report 2017

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
(e) Changes in accounting policies
HEINEKEN has adopted the following new standards and amendments to standards, including any consequential amendments to other
standards, with a date of initial application of 1 January 2017:
––Disclosure Initiative (amendments to IAS 7)
––Recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses (amendments to IAS 12)
––Annual Improvements to IFRS’s 2014-2016 Cycle – amendments to IFRS 12
These changes had no significant impact on the disclosures or amounts recognised in HEINEKEN’s consolidated financial statements.

3. Significant accounting policies
General
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements and have
been applied consistently by HEINEKEN entities.

(a) Basis of consolidation
(i) Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred
to HEINEKEN. HEINEKEN controls an entity when it has power over the investee, is exposed or has the right to variable returns from its involvement
with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
HEINEKEN measures goodwill at the acquisition date as the fair value of the consideration transferred plus the fair value of any previously held
equity interest in the acquiree and the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, less the net recognised amount
(generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised
immediately in profit or loss.
The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships. Such amounts are generally
recognised in profit or loss.
Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that HEINEKEN incurs in connection with a
business combination are expensed as incurred.
Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it is
not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent considerations
are recognised in profit or loss.
Contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are recognised at fair value even if it is not probable that an outflow will be required
to settle the obligation. After initial recognition and until the liability is settled, cancelled or expired, the contingent liability is measured at the
higher of the amount that would be recognised in accordance with IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets and the initial
liability amount.
(ii) Acquisitions of non-controlling interests
Acquisitions of non-controlling interests are accounted for as transactions with owners in their capacity as owners and therefore no goodwill is
recognised as a result. Adjustments to non-controlling interests arising from transactions that do not involve the loss of control are based on a
proportionate amount of the net assets of the subsidiary.
(iii) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by HEINEKEN. HEINEKEN controls an entity when it has power over the investee, is exposed or has the right
to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The financial
statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control
ceases. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by HEINEKEN.
Losses applicable to the non-controlling interests in a subsidiary are allocated to the non-controlling interests, even if doing so causes the noncontrolling interests to have a deficit balance.
(iv) Loss of control
Upon the loss of control, HEINEKEN derecognises the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, any non-controlling interests and the other
components of equity related to the subsidiary. Any resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. If HEINEKEN retains any interest in the
previous subsidiary, such interest is measured at fair value at the date that control is lost. Subsequently, it is accounted for as an equity-accounted
investee or as an available-for-sale financial asset, depending on the level of influence retained.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

3. Significant accounting policies (continued)
(v) Interests in equity-accounted investees
HEINEKEN’s investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Investments in associates are
those entities in which HEINEKEN has significant influence, but no control or joint control, over the financial and operating policies. Joint ventures
are the arrangements in which HEINEKEN has joint control, whereby HEINEKEN has rights to the net assets of the arrangement, rather than rights
to its assets and obligations for its liabilities.
Investments in associates and joint ventures are recognised initially at cost. The cost of the investment includes transaction costs.
The consolidated financial statements include HEINEKEN’s share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income, after adjustments to align
the accounting policies with those of HEINEKEN, from the date that significant influence or joint control commences until the date that significant
influence or joint control ceases.
When HEINEKEN’s share of losses exceeds the carrying amount of the associate or joint venture, including any long-term investments, the carrying
amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that HEINEKEN has an obligation or has made a
payment on behalf of the associate or joint venture.
(vi) Transactions eliminated on consolidation
Intra-HEINEKEN balances and transactions, and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intra-HEINEKEN
transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity-accounted
associates and JVs are eliminated against the investment to the extent of HEINEKEN’s interest in the investee. Unrealised losses are eliminated in
the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.

(b) Foreign currency
(i) Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of HEINEKEN entities at the exchange rates at the dates of
the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are retranslated to the functional currency
at the exchange rate at that date. The foreign currency gain or loss arising on monetary items is the difference between amortised cost in the
functional currency at the beginning of the period, adjusted for effective interest and payments during the period, and the amortised cost
in foreign currency translated at the exchange rate at the end of the reporting period.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at fair value are retranslated to the functional currency
at the exchange rate at the date that the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items in a foreign currency that are measured at cost are
translated into the functional currency using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Foreign currency differences arising on retranslation are recognised in profit or loss, except for differences arising on the retranslation of availablefor-sale (equity) investments and foreign currency differences arising on the retranslation of a financial liability designated as a hedge of a net
investment, which are recognised in other comprehensive income.
(ii) Foreign operations
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated to Euro at
exchange rates at the reporting date. The income and expenses of foreign operations, excluding foreign operations in hyperinflationary economies,
are translated to Euro at exchange rates approximating to the exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. Group entities, with a
functional currency being the currency of a hyperinflationary economy, first restate their financial statements in accordance with IAS 29, Financial
Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies. The related income, costs and balance sheet amounts are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling
at the balance sheet date. In 2017 HEINEKEN did not have any foreign operations in hyperinflationary economies.
Foreign currency differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and are presented within equity in the translation reserve. However,
if the operation is not a wholly owned subsidiary, the relevant proportionate share of the translation difference is allocated to the non-controlling
interests. When a foreign operation is disposed of such that control, significant influence or joint control is lost, the cumulative amount in the
translation reserve related to that foreign operation is reclassified to profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal. When HEINEKEN disposes
of only part of its interest in a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation while retaining control, the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount
is reattributed to non-controlling interests. When HEINEKEN disposes of only part of its investment in an associate or joint venture that includes
a foreign operation while retaining significant influence or joint control, the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reclassified to profit
or loss.
Foreign exchange gains and losses arising from a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign operation, the settlement of which is
neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, are considered to form part of a net investment in a foreign operation and are recognised in
other comprehensive income, and are presented within equity in the translation reserve.

(iii) Hedge of net investments in foreign operations
Foreign currency differences arising on the translation of a financial liability designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation are
recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent that the hedge is effective and regardless of whether the net investment is held directly or
through an intermediate parent. These differences are presented within equity in the translation reserve. To the extent that the hedge is ineffective,
such differences are recognised in profit or loss. When the hedged part of a net investment is disposed of, the relevant amount in the translation
reserve is transferred to profit or loss as part of the profit or loss on disposal.

(c) Non-derivative financial instruments
(i) General
Non-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity and debt securities, trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents,
loans and borrowings, and trade and other payables.
Non-derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value plus, for instruments not at fair value through profit or loss, any directly
attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, non-derivative financial instruments are measured as described below.
If HEINEKEN has a legal right to offset financial assets with financial liabilities and if HEINEKEN intends either to settle on a net basis or to realise
the asset and settle the liability simultaneously, financial assets and liabilities are presented in the statement of financial position as a net amount.
The right of set-off is available today and not contingent on a future event and it is also legally enforceable for all counterparties in a normal course
of business, as well as in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy.
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. Bank overdrafts and commercial papers form an integral part of HEINEKEN’s
cash management and are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
Accounting policies for interest income, interest expenses and other net finance income and expenses are discussed in note 3(r).
(ii) Held-to-maturity investments
If HEINEKEN has the positive intent and ability to hold debt securities to maturity, they are classified as held-to-maturity. Debt securities are loans
and long-term receivables and are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses. Investments heldto-maturity are recognised or derecognised on the day they are transferred to or by HEINEKEN.
(iii) Available-for-sale investments
HEINEKEN’s investments in equity securities and certain debt securities are classified as available-for-sale. Subsequent to initial recognition, they are
measured at fair value and changes therein – other than impairment losses (see note 3i(i)) and foreign currency differences on available-for-sale
monetary items (see note 3b(i)) – are recognised in other comprehensive income and presented within equity in the fair value reserve. When these
investments are derecognised, the relevant cumulative gain or loss in the fair value reserve is transferred to profit or loss.
Where these investments are interest-bearing, interest calculated using the effective interest method is recognised in profit or loss. Available-for-sale
investments are recognised or derecognised by HEINEKEN on the date it commits to purchase or sell the investments.
(iv) Other
Other non-derivative financial instruments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.

3. Significant accounting policies (continued)
(d) Derivative financial instruments (including hedge accounting)
(i) General
HEINEKEN uses derivatives in the ordinary course of business in order to manage market risks. Generally, HEINEKEN applies hedge accounting in
order to minimise the effects of foreign currency, interest rate or commodity price fluctuations in profit or loss.
Derivatives that can be used are interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements, caps and floors, commodity swaps, spot and forward exchange
contracts and options. Transactions are entered into with a limited number of counterparties with strong credit ratings. Foreign currency, interest
rate and commodity hedging operations are governed by internal policies and rules approved and monitored by the Executive Board.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value, with attributable transaction costs recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
Derivatives for which hedge accounting is not applied are accounted for as instruments at fair value through profit or loss. When derivatives qualify
for hedge accounting, subsequent measurement is at fair value, and changes therein accounted for as described in 3b(iii), 3d(ii) or 3d(iii).
(ii) Cash flow hedges
Changes in the fair value of the derivative hedging instrument designated as a cash flow hedge are recognised in other comprehensive income
and presented in the hedging reserve within equity to the extent that the hedge is effective. To the extent that the hedge is ineffective, changes in
fair value are recognised in profit or loss.
If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, hedge accounting is
discontinued. The cumulative unrealised gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the hedging reserve
in equity is recognised in profit or loss immediately. When a hedging instrument is terminated, but the hedged transaction still is expected to occur,
the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in other comprehensive income and is recognised in accordance with the above-mentioned policy
when the transaction occurs. When the hedged item is a non-financial asset, the amount recognised in other comprehensive income is transferred
to the carrying amount of the asset when it is recognised. In other cases, the amount recognised in other comprehensive income is transferred to
the same line of profit or loss in the same period that the hedged item affects profit or loss.
(iii) Fair value hedges
Changes in the fair value of a derivative hedging instrument designated as a fair value hedge are recognised in profit or loss. The hedged item is
also stated at fair value in respect of the risk being hedged; the gain or loss attributable to the hedged risk is recognised in profit or loss and adjusts
the carrying amount of the hedged item.
If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged item for which the effective
interest method is used is amortised to profit or loss over the period to maturity.
(iv) Separable embedded derivatives
Embedded derivatives are separated from the host contract and accounted for separately if the economic characteristics and risks of the host
contract and the embedded derivative are not closely related, a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would
meet the definition of a derivative, and the combined instrument is not measured at fair value through profit or loss. Changes in the fair value
of separable embedded derivatives are recognised immediately in profit or loss.

(e) Share capital
(i) Ordinary shares
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares are recognised as a deduction from
equity, net of any tax effects.
(ii) Repurchase of share capital (treasury shares)
When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, which includes directly attributable costs, is net
of any tax effects recognised as a deduction from equity. Repurchased shares are classified as treasury shares and are presented in the reserve
for own shares.
When treasury shares are sold or reissued subsequently, the amount received is recognised as an increase in equity, and the resulting surplus or
deficit on the transaction is transferred to or from retained earnings.
(iii) Dividends
Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are declared.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
(f) Property, plant and equipment
(i) Owned assets
Items of property, plant and equipment (P, P & E) are measured at cost less government grants received (refer to (q)), accumulated depreciation
(refer to (iv)) and accumulated impairment losses (3i(ii)).
Cost comprises the initial purchase price increased with expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset (such as transports
and non-recoverable taxes). The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labour and any other costs directly
attributable to bringing the asset to a working condition for its intended use (refer to an appropriate proportion of production overheads), and
the costs of dismantling and removing the items and restoring the site on which they are located. Borrowing costs related to the acquisition or
construction of qualifying assets are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset. Cost also may include transfers from equity of any gain or loss on
qualifying cash flow hedges of foreign currency purchases of P, P & E.
Spare parts that are acquired as part of an equipment purchase and only to be used in connection with this specific equipment or purchased
software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment are capitalised and amortised as part of that equipment. In all other cases,
spare parts are carried as inventory and recognised in the income statement as consumed. Where an item of P, P & E comprises major components
having different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of P, P & E.
Returnable bottles and kegs in circulation are recorded within P, P & E and a corresponding liability is recorded in respect of the obligation to repay
the customers’ deposits. Deposits paid by customers for returnable items are reflected in the consolidated statement of financial position within
current liabilities.
(ii) Leased assets
Leases in terms of which HEINEKEN assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Upon initial
recognition, P, P & E acquired by way of finance lease is measured at an amount equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value of the
minimum lease payments at inception of the lease. Lease payments are apportioned between the outstanding liability and finance charges so as
to achieve a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Other leases are operating leases and are not recognised in HEINEKEN’s statement of financial position. Payments made under operating leases
are charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. When an operating lease is terminated before the lease period
has expired, any payment required to be made to the lessor by way of penalty is recognised as an expense in the period in which termination
takes place.
(iii) Subsequent expenditure
The cost of replacing a part of an item of P, P & E is recognised in the carrying amount of the item or recognised as a separate asset, as
appropriate, if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the part will flow to HEINEKEN and its cost can be measured
reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. The costs of the day-to-day servicing of P, P & E are recognised in profit or loss
when incurred.
(iv) Depreciation
Depreciation is calculated over the depreciable amount, which is the cost of an asset, or other amount substituted for cost, less its residual value.
Land, except for financial leases on land over the contractual period, is not depreciated as it is deemed to have an infinite life. Depreciation on
other P, P & E is charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of items of P, P & E, and major components that are
accounted for separately, since this most closely reflects the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits embodied in the
asset. Assets under construction are not depreciated. Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives unless it
is reasonably certain that HEINEKEN will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term. The estimated useful lives for the current and comparative
years are as follows:
––Buildings

30 – 40 years

––Plant and equipment

10 – 30 years

––Other fixed assets

3 – 10 years

Where parts of an item of P, P & E have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of P, P & E.
The depreciation methods and residual value as well as the useful lives are reassessed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each financial year-end.
(v) Gains and losses on sale
Net gains on sale of items of P, P & E are presented in profit or loss as other income. Net losses on sale are included in depreciation. Net gains
and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, recovery of the
consideration is probable, the associated costs can be estimated reliably, and there is no continuing management involvement with the P, P & E.

3. Significant accounting policies (continued)
(g) Intangible assets
(i) Goodwill
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures and represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition over
HEINEKEN’s interest in net fair value of the net identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree.
Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in ‘intangible assets’. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of associates and joint ventures is
included in the carrying amount of the associates and joint ventures.
Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses (refer to accounting policy 3i(ii)). Goodwill is allocated to individual or groups of
cash-generating units (CGUs) for the purpose of impairment testing and is tested annually for impairment. Negative goodwill is recognised directly
in profit or loss as other income.
(ii) Brands
Brands acquired, separately or as part of a business combination, are capitalised if they meet the definition of an intangible asset and the
recognition criteria are satisfied.
Strategic brands are well-known international/local brands with a strong market position and an established brand name. Brands are amortised
on an individual basis over the estimated useful life of the brand.
(iii) Customer-related, contract-based intangibles and reacquired rights
Customer-related and contract-based intangibles are capitalised if they meet the definition of an intangible asset and the recognition criteria
are satisfied. If the amounts are not material, these are included in the brand valuation. The relationship between brands and customer-related
intangibles is carefully considered so that brands and customer-related intangibles are not both recognised on the basis of the same cash flows.
Reacquired rights are identifiable intangible assets recognised in an acquisition that represent the right an acquirer previously has granted to the
acquiree to use one or more of the acquirer’s recognised or unrecognised assets.
Customer-related and contract-based intangibles acquired as part of a business combination are valued at fair value. Customer-related and
contract-based intangibles acquired separately are measured at cost.
Customer-related, contract-based intangibles and reacquired rights are amortised over the remaining useful life of the customer relationships
or the period of the contractual arrangements.
(iv) Software, research and development and other intangible assets
Purchased software is measured at cost less accumulated amortisation (refer to (vi)) and impairment losses (refer to accounting policy 3i(ii)).
Expenditure on internally developed software is capitalised when the expenditure qualifies as development activities, otherwise it is recognised
in profit or loss when incurred.
Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new technical knowledge and understanding, is recognised in profit
or loss when incurred.
Development activities involve a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products, software and processes.
Development expenditure is capitalised only if development costs can be measured reliably, the product or process is technically and commercially
feasible, future economic benefits are probable, and HEINEKEN intends to and has sufficient resources to complete development and to use or sell
the asset. The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and overhead costs that are directly attributable to preparing the
asset for its intended use, and capitalised borrowing costs. Other development expenditure is recognised in profit or loss when incurred.
Capitalised development expenditure is measured at cost less accumulated amortisation (refer to (vi)) and accumulated impairment losses (refer
to accounting policy 3i(ii)).
Other intangible assets that are acquired by HEINEKEN and have finite useful lives are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation (refer to
(vi)) and impairment losses (refer to accounting policy 3i(ii)). Expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands is recognised in profit or loss
when incurred.
(v) Subsequent expenditure
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates.
All other expenditure is expensed when incurred.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
(vi) Amortisation
Amortisation is calculated over the cost of the asset, or other amount substituted for cost, less its residual value. Intangible assets with a finite life
are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives from the date they are available for use, since this most closely reflects the
expected pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits embodied in the asset. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
––Strategic brands

40 – 50 years

––Other brands

15 – 25 years

––Customer-related and contract-based intangibles

5 – 20 years

––Reacquired rights

3 – 12 years

––Software

3 – 7 years

––Capitalised development costs

3 years

Amortisation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted if appropriate.
(vii) Gains and losses on sale
Net gains on sale of intangible assets are presented in profit or loss as other income. Net losses on sale are included in amortisation. Net gains
and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, recovery of
the consideration is probable, the associated costs can be estimated reliably, and there is no continuing management involvement with the
intangible assets.

(h) Inventories
(i) General
Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of inventories is based on the weighted average cost formula, and
includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories, production or conversion costs and other costs incurred in bringing them to their existing
location and condition. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion
and selling expenses.
(ii) Finished products and work in progress
Finished products and work in progress are measured at manufacturing cost based on weighted averages and taking into account the production
stage reached. Costs include an appropriate share of direct production overheads based on normal operating capacity.
(iii) Other inventories and spare parts
The cost of other inventories is based on weighted averages. Spare parts are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Value reductions
and usage of parts are charged to profit or loss. Spare parts that are acquired as part of an equipment purchase and only to be used in connection
with this specific equipment are initially capitalised and depreciated as part of the equipment.

(i) Impairment
(i) Financial assets
A financial asset is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any objective evidence that it is impaired. A financial asset is
considered to be impaired if objective evidence indicates that one or more events have had a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows
of that asset that can be estimated reliably.
Evidence of impairment may include indications that the debtors or a group of debtors are experiencing significant financial difficulty, default
or delinquency in interest or principal payments, the probability that they will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation, and where
observable data indicates that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows, such as changes in arrears or economic
conditions that correlate with defaults.
An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the difference between its carrying amount and the
present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate. An impairment loss in respect of an available-forsale financial asset is calculated by reference to its current fair value.
Individually significant financial assets are tested for impairment on an individual basis. The remaining financial assets are assessed collectively
in groups that share similar credit risk characteristics.
All impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. Any cumulative loss in respect of an available-for-sale financial asset recognised previously
in other comprehensive income and presented in the fair value reserve in equity is transferred to profit or loss.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

3. Significant accounting policies (continued)
An impairment loss is reversed if the reversal can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised. For financial
assets measured at amortised cost and available-for-sale financial assets that are debt securities, the reversal is recognised in profit or loss.
For available-for-sale financial assets that are equity securities, the reversal is recognised in other comprehensive income.
(ii) Non-financial assets
The carrying amounts of HEINEKEN’s non-financial assets, other than inventories (refer to accounting policy (h)) and deferred tax assets (refer
to accounting policy (s)), are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication
exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. For goodwill and intangible assets that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount
is estimated each year at the same time.
For the purpose of impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that
generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets (the cashgenerating unit, ‘CGU’).
The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, the
estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time
value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the acquirer’s CGUs, or groups of CGUs
expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level
within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. Goodwill is monitored on regional, sub-regional or country
level depending on the characteristics of the acquisition, the synergies to be achieved and the level of integration.
An impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss if the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses
recognised in respect of a CGU are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units and then to reduce the
carrying amounts of the other assets in the unit (group of units) on a pro rata basis. An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss
has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable
amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have
been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
Goodwill that forms part of the carrying amount of an investment in an associate and joint venture is not recognised separately, and therefore is
not tested for impairment separately. Instead, the entire amount of the investment in an associate and joint venture is tested for impairment as a
single asset when there is objective evidence that the investment in an associate may be impaired.

(j) Assets or disposal groups classified as held for sale
Assets or disposal groups comprising assets and liabilities, that are expected to be recovered primarily through sale rather than through continuing
use are classified as held for sale. Immediately before classification as held for sale, the assets, or components of a disposal group, are measured at
the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs of disposal. Any impairment loss on a disposal group is first allocated to goodwill, and
then to remaining assets and liabilities on a pro rata basis, except that no loss is allocated to inventories, financial assets, deferred tax assets and
employee defined benefit plan assets, which continue to be measured in accordance with HEINEKEN’s accounting policies. Impairment losses on
initial classification as held for sale and subsequent gains or losses on remeasurement are recognised in profit or loss. Gains are not recognised in
excess of any cumulative impairment loss.
Intangible assets and P, P & E once classified as held for sale are not amortised or depreciated. In addition, equity accounting of equity-accounted
investees ceases once classified as held for sale.

(k) Employee benefits
(i) Defined contribution plans
A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan (pension plan) under which HEINEKEN pays fixed contributions into a separate
entity. HEINEKEN has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all
employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an employee benefit expense in profit or loss in the periods
during which services are rendered by employees. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction
in future payments is available. Contributions to a defined contribution plan that are due more than 12 months after the end of the period in
which the employee renders the service are discounted to their present value.
(ii) Defined benefit plans
A defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan (pension plan) that is not a defined contribution plan. Typically, defined benefit plans
define an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of
service and compensation.

Heineken N.V. Annual Report 2017

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
HEINEKEN’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future
benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its present
value. The fair value of any defined benefit plan assets is deducted. The discount rate is the yield at balance sheet date on high-quality credit-rated
bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of HEINEKEN’s obligations and that are denominated in the same currency in which
the benefits are expected to be paid.
The calculations are performed annually by qualified actuaries using the projected unit credit method. When the calculation results in a benefit to
HEINEKEN, the recognised asset is limited to the present value of economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or
reductions in future contributions to the plan. In order to calculate the present value of economic benefits, consideration is given to any minimum
funding requirements that apply to any plan in HEINEKEN. An economic benefit is available to HEINEKEN if it is realisable during the life of the
plan, or on settlement of the plan liabilities.
When the benefits of a plan are changed, the expense or benefit is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
HEINEKEN recognises all actuarial gains and losses arising from defined benefit plans immediately in other comprehensive income and all
expenses related to defined benefit plans in personnel expenses and other net finance income and expenses in profit or loss.
(iii) Other long-term employee benefits
HEINEKEN’s net obligation in respect of long-term employee benefits, other than pension plans, is the amount of future benefit that employees
have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value
of any related assets is deducted. The discount rate is the yield at balance sheet date on high-quality credit-rated bonds that have maturity dates
approximating to the terms of HEINEKEN’s obligations. The obligation is calculated using the projected unit credit method. Any actuarial gains and
losses are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise.
(iv) Termination benefits
Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by HEINEKEN before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee
accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits.
Termination benefits are recognised as an expense when HEINEKEN is demonstrably committed to either terminating the employment of current
employees according to a detailed formal plan without possibility of withdrawal, or providing termination benefits as a result of an offer made to
encourage voluntary redundancy. Termination benefits for voluntary redundancies are recognised if HEINEKEN has made an offer encouraging
voluntary redundancy, it is probable that the offer will be accepted, and the number of acceptances can be estimated reliably.
Benefits falling due more than 12 months after the balance sheet date are discounted to their present value.
(v) Share-based payment plan (LTV)
HEINEKEN has a performance-based share plan (Long-Term Variable award (LTV)) for both the Executive Board and senior management (refer to
note 27).
The grant date fair value, adjusted for expected dividends, of the share rights granted is recognised as personnel expenses with a corresponding
increase in equity (equity-settled) over the period that the employees become unconditionally entitled to the share rights. The costs of the
share plan for both the Executive Board and senior management members are spread evenly over the performance period, during which
vesting conditions are applicable subject to continued services. The total amount to be expensed is determined taking into consideration the
expected forfeitures.
At each balance sheet date, HEINEKEN revises its estimates of the number of share rights that are expected to vest, for the 100 per cent internal
performance conditions of the running share plans for the senior management members and the Executive Board. It recognises the impact of
the revision of original estimates (only applicable for non-market performance conditions, if any) in profit or loss, with a corresponding adjustment
to equity.
(vi) Matching share entitlement
The Executive Board is entitled to matching shares (refer to note 33). The grant date fair value of the matching shares is recognised as personnel
expenses in the income statement as it is deemed an equity-settled share-based payment.
(vii) Short-term employee benefits
Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is
recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term benefits if HEINEKEN has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this
amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.

(l) Provisions
(i) General
A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, HEINEKEN has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and
it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are measured at the present value of the
expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of
money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised as part of net finance expenses.
(ii) Restructuring
A provision for restructuring is recognised when HEINEKEN has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring has either
commenced or has been announced publicly. Future operating losses are not provided for. The provision includes the benefit commitments in
connection with early retirement and redundancy schemes.
(iii) Onerous contracts
A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by HEINEKEN from a contract are lower than the unavoidable
cost of meeting its obligations under the contract. The provision is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the
contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract and taking into consideration any reasonably obtainable sub-leases for onerous
lease contracts. Before a provision is established, HEINEKEN recognises any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract.
(iv) Other
The other provisions, not being provisions for restructuring or onerous contracts, consist mainly of surety and guarantees, litigation and claims and
environmental provisions.

(m) Loans and borrowings
Loans and borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Loans and borrowings are subsequently stated at
amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in profit or loss over the
period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. Loans and borrowings included in a fair value hedge are stated at fair value in respect
of the risk being hedged.
Loans and borrowings for which HEINEKEN has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance
sheet date are classified as non-current liabilities.

(n) Revenue
(i) Products sold
Revenue relates to the sale and delivery of products (own-produced finished goods and goods for resale) in the ordinary course of business. The product
portfolio of HEINEKEN mainly consists of beer, soft drinks and cider. Revenue is recognised in the income statement when all significant risks and rewards
have been transferred to the customer and when the income can be reliably measured and no significant uncertainties remain regarding recovery of the
consideration due, associated costs or the possible return of goods, and there is no continuing management involvement with the goods. For the majority
of the sales transactions, the risks and rewards are transferred to the buyer on delivery of the products. Revenue from the sale of goods is measured at the
fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of returns and allowances, trade discounts, volume rebates, discounts for cash payments and
excise taxes.
If it is probable that discounts will be granted and the amount can be measured reliably, the discount is recognised as a reduction of revenue as the
sales are recognised.
(ii) Other revenue
Other revenues are proceeds from royalties, rental income, pub management services and technical services to third parties, net of sales tax.
Royalties are recognised in profit or loss on an accrual basis in accordance with the relevant agreement. Rental income, pub management services
and technical services are recognised in profit or loss when the services have been delivered.

(o) Other income
Other income includes gains from sale of P, P & E, intangible assets and (interests in) subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, net of sales tax.
They are recognised in profit or loss when risks and rewards have been transferred to the buyer.

(p) Expenses
(i) Operating lease payments
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease incentives received
are recognised in profit or loss as an integral part of the total lease expense, over the term of the lease.
(ii) Finance lease payments
Minimum lease payments under finance leases are apportioned between the finance expense and the reduction of the outstanding liability.
The finance expense is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining
balance of the liability. Contingent lease payments are accounted for by revising the minimum lease payments over the remaining term of the
lease when the lease adjustment is confirmed.

(q) Government grants
Government grants are recognised at their fair value when it is reasonably assured that HEINEKEN will comply with the conditions attaching to
them and the grants will be received.
Government grants relating to P, P & E are deducted from the carrying amount of the asset.
Government grants relating to costs are deferred and recognised in profit or loss over the period necessary to match them with the costs that they
are intended to compensate.

(r) Interest income, interest expenses and other net finance income and expenses
Interest income and expenses are recognised as they accrue in profit or loss, using the effective interest method unless collectability is in doubt.
Borrowing costs that are not directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are recognised in profit or loss
using the effective interest method.
Other net finance income and expenses comprises dividend income, gains and losses on the disposal of available-for-sale investments, changes
in the fair value of investments designated at fair value through profit or loss and held for trading investments, changes in fair value of hedging
instruments that are recognised in profit or loss, unwinding of the discount on provisions, impairment losses recognised on investments and interest
on the net defined benefit obligation. Dividend income is recognised in the income statement on the date that HEINEKEN’s right to receive
payment is established, which in the case of quoted securities is the ex-dividend date.
Foreign currency gains and losses are reported on a net basis in the other net finance income and expenses.

3. Significant accounting policies (continued)
(s) Income tax
Income tax comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax and deferred tax are recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it
relates to a business combination, or items recognised directly in equity, or in other comprehensive income.
(i) Current tax
Current tax is the expected income tax payable or receivable in respect of taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to income tax payable in respect of previous years.
(ii) Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting
purposes and their tax bases.
Deferred tax is not recognised for:
––temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither
accounting nor taxable profit or loss
––temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures to the extent that HEINEKEN is able to control the
timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future
––taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.
The measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities reflects the tax consequences that would follow the manner in which HEINEKEN expects, at
the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are expected
to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income
taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different taxable entities which intend either to settle current tax liabilities
and assets on a net basis or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
Deferred tax is provided for on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing of the reversal
of the temporary difference is controlled by HEINEKEN and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
A deferred tax asset is recognised for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences, to the extent that it is probable that
future taxable profits will be available against which they can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date and are
reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
(iii) Uncertain tax positions
In determining the amount of current and deferred income tax, HEINEKEN takes into account the impact of uncertain income tax positions and
whether additional taxes and interest may be due. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of judgements
about future events. New information may become available that causes HEINEKEN to change its judgement regarding the adequacy of existing
tax liabilities; such changes to tax liabilities will impact the income tax expense in the period that such a determination is made.

(t) Discontinued operations
A discontinued operation is a component of HEINEKEN’s business that represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of
operations that has been disposed of or is held for sale or distribution, or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. Classification as a
discontinued operation occurs upon disposal or when the operation meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, if earlier. When an operation
is classified as a discontinued operation, the comparative statement of comprehensive income is re-presented as if the operation had been
discontinued from the start of the comparative year.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
(u) Earnings per share
HEINEKEN presents basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss
attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, adjusted
for the weighted average number of own shares purchased in the year. Diluted EPS is determined by dividing the profit or loss attributable to
ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding, adjusted for the weighted average number of own shares
purchased in the year and for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares which comprise share rights granted to employees.

(v) Cash flow statement
The cash flow statement is prepared using the indirect method. Changes in balance sheet items that have not resulted in cash flows such as
translation differences, fair value changes, equity-settled share-based payments and other non-cash items have been eliminated for the purpose of
preparing this statement. Assets and liabilities acquired as part of a business combination are included in investing activities (net of cash acquired).
Dividends paid to ordinary shareholders are included in financing activities. Dividends received are classified as operating activities. Interest paid is
also included in operating activities.

(w) Operating segments
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Executive Board, which is considered to be
HEINEKEN’s chief operating decision-maker. An operating segment is a component of HEINEKEN that engages in business activities from which
it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of HEINEKEN’s other components.
All operating segments’ operating results are reviewed regularly by the Executive Board to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the
segment and to assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available.
Inter-segment transfers or transactions are entered into under the normal commercial terms and conditions that would also be available to
unrelated third parties.
Segment results, assets and liabilities that are reported to the Executive Board include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those
that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. Unallocated result items comprise net finance expenses and income tax expenses. Unallocated assets
comprise current other investments and cash call deposits.
Segment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the period to acquire P, P & E, and intangible assets other than goodwill.

(x) Recently issued IFRS
New relevant standards and interpretations not yet adopted
A number of new standards and amendments to standards are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 January 2017, which HEINEKEN has
not applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements.
IFRS 9 Financial instruments
IFRS 9, was published in July 2014 and subsequently endorsed by the European Union on 9 November 2017. IFRS 9 includes revised guidance
on classification and measurement of financial instruments, including a new expected credit loss model for calculating impairment on financial
assets, and new general hedge accounting requirements. The standard replaces existing guidance in IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition
and Measurement. HEINEKEN will implement IFRS 9 per 1 January 2018 using the modified retrospective approach, meaning that the 2017
comparative numbers in the 2018 financial statements will not be restated. Any impact of IFRS 9 as of 1 January 2018 will be recognised directly
in equity.
HEINEKEN has reviewed the impact of this new standard and has concluded that the impact is limited:
––With regard to the revised classification and measurement principles, IFRS 9 contains three classification categories: ‘measured at amortised cost’,
‘fair value through other comprehensive income’ (FVTOCI) and ‘fair value through profit and loss’ (FVTPL). The standard eliminates the existing
IAS 39 categories: ‘loans and receivables’, ‘held to maturity’ and ‘available-for-sale’. For HEINEKEN this new classification only means that the
assets currently classified as available-for-sale will be measured at FVTOCI which constitutes no significant change, except for the accounting for
accumulative gains or losses when equity securities measured at FVTOCI are disposed of. These cumulative gains or losses will not be recognised
in the income statement upon disposal but kept in the fair value reserve. HEINEKEN has no investments classified as held to maturity and the
other categories involve no change in measurement for HEINEKEN.
––With regard to the impact of the expected loss model on trade receivables and both advances and loans to customers HEINEKEN concluded that
the impact is immaterial. The impact on HEINEKEN’s future consolidated income statement is also expected to be immaterial as the standard
requires provisions to be recorded earlier and the initial impact of this timing difference is recorded in equity upon implementation.
––For the new hedging requirements of IFRS 9 HEINEKEN concluded that all current hedging relationships will continue to qualify as hedging
relationships upon application of IFRS 9. For existing hedges HEINEKEN will exclude the foreign currency basis spread from the hedge relation
only when this improves hedge effectiveness by applying the cost of hedging approach. HEINEKEN will retrospectively apply the cost of hedging
approach for these hedges and recognise any initial impact, which is expected to be immaterial, directly in equity upon implementation.

3. Significant accounting policies (continued)
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
In May 2014, the International Accounting Standards Board issued IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’, which was subsequently
endorsed by the European Union on 22 September 2016. IFRS 15 establishes a framework for determining whether, how much and when revenue
is recognised from contracts with customers. IFRS 15 supersedes existing standards and interpretations related to revenue. HEINEKEN will apply the
new standard as per 1 January 2018. For implementation the full retrospective method will be applied, meaning prior period financial information
will be restated. HEINEKEN concluded that IFRS 15 will not impact the timing of revenue recognition. However the amount of recognised revenue
will be impacted by payments to customers and excise taxes. HEINEKEN has evaluated the available practical expedients for application of the
standard and concluded that these options have no significant impact on HEINEKEN’s revenue recognition. The practical expedients will therefore
not be applied.
IFRS 15 will impact the accounting for certain payments to customers, such as listing fees and marketing support expenses. Most of these
payments are currently recorded as operating expenses, but will be considered a reduction of revenue under IFRS 15. Only when these payments
relate to a distinct service the amounts will continue to be recorded as operating expenses.
IFRS 15 will also impact the accounting for excise tax. Based on the current revenue standards different policies are applied by peers in our industry.
Some companies include all excises in revenue, some record excise only for specific countries and some, like HEINEKEN, exclude all excise from
revenue. The clarifications to IFRS 15 describes that an ‘all or nothing’ approach is no longer possible; an assessment of the excise tax needs to be
done on a country by country basis. In most countries where HEINEKEN operates, excise duties are effectively a production tax. Increases in excise
duty are not always (fully) passed on to customers and where customers fail to pay for products received, HEINEKEN cannot, or can only partly,
reclaim the excise duty. In these countries the excise tax is borne by HEINEKEN and included in revenue applying IFRS 15. Only for those countries
where excise tax is fully based on the sales value, HEINEKEN concluded that the excise tax is collected on behalf of a third party. For these countries
the excise is excluded from revenue. The conclusion whether excise is collected on behalf of a third party or borne by HEINEKEN requires significant
judgement due to the variety in excise tax legislation in the countries HEINEKEN operates in.
To provide full transparency on the impact of the accounting for excise, HEINEKEN will present the excise tax expense on a separate line below
revenue in the consolidated income statement. A new subtotal called ‘Net revenue’ will be added. This ‘Net revenue’ subtotal is ‘revenue’ as defined
in IFRS 15 (after discounts) minus the excise taxes for those countries where the excise is borne by HEINEKEN. HEINEKEN will furthermore disclose
the excise collected on behalf of third parties, which is excluded from revenue, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
The IFRS 15 changes described above will have no impact on operating profit, net profit and EPS.
The following table presents 2017 figures, including the impact of applying IFRS 15. The final impact is still under review and as a result the actual
restated financial information may differ materially from those included in this overview. However this table gives HEINEKEN’s best estimate of the
impact of IFRS 15:

IFRS 16 Leases
IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ was published in January 2016 and subsequently endorsed by the European Union on 9 November 2017. IFRS 16 establishes
a revised framework for determining whether a lease is recognised in the (Consolidated) Statement of Financial Position. The standard replaces
existing guidance on leases, including IAS 17. HEINEKEN will implement IFRS 16 per 1 January 2019 by applying the modified retrospective
method, meaning that the 2018 comparative numbers in the 2019 financial statements will not be restated to show the impact of IFRS 16.
Under the new standard lease contracts will be recognised on HEINEKEN’s balance sheet and subsequently depreciated on a straight line basis.
The liability recognised upon transition is measured based on discounted future cash flows and the future interest will be recorded in interest
expenses. Lease expenses currently recorded in the income statement will therefore be replaced by depreciation and interest expenses for all lease
contracts within the scope of the standard. The financial impact of the new standard on HEINEKEN is not yet known.
HEINEKEN completed the selection of a lease contract management and accounting tool in 2017, which will support the implementation of
the new standard. HEINEKEN has around 30,000 operating leases that will be recorded on HEINEKEN’s balance sheet as a result of IFRS 16.
These operating leases mainly relate to offices, warehouses, pubs, stores, cars and (forklift) trucks.
In selecting which practical expedients to apply HEINEKEN has focused on reducing the complexity of implementation. Based on analysis of the
options available, HEINEKEN will:
––use the option to grandfather classification as a lease for the existing contracts
––measure the Right of Use Asset based on the lease liability recognised
––apply the short-term and low value exemptions
––not use the transition option for leases with a short remaining contract period
––apply the option to exclude non-lease components from the lease liability for real estate leases
––most likely not use the option to exclude non-lease components from the lease liability for equipment leases because the lessors of HEINEKEN
are currently not able to provide a sufficiently reliable and consistent split for both the calculation and invoicing.

Other standards and interpretations
The following new or amended standards are not expected to have a significant impact of HEINEKEN’s consolidated financial statements:
––Classification and measurement of Share-based Payments (amendments to IFRS 2)
––Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration (IFRIC 22)
––Uncertainty over tax treatments (IFRIC 23)
––Transfers of Investment Property (amendments to IAS 40)
––Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2014–2016 Cycle (amendments IFRS 1 and IAS 28).

4. Determination of fair values
General
A number of HEINEKEN’s accounting policies and disclosures require the determination of fair value, for both financial and non-financial assets and
liabilities. Fair values have been determined for measurement and/or disclosure purposes based on the following methods. When applicable, further
information about the assumptions made in determining fair values or for the purpose of impairment testing is disclosed in the notes specific to
that asset or liability.

Fair value as a result of business combinations
(i) Property, plant and equipment
The fair value of P, P & E recognised as a result of a business combination is based on depreciated replacement cost, taking into account
economical and functional obsolescence, or market prices for similar items when available. For acquired pub estates, the fair values are based
on the stabilised earnings valuation method.
(ii) Intangible assets
The fair value of brands acquired in a business combination is based on the relief from royalty method or determined using the multi-period excess
earnings method (MEEM). The fair value of customer relationships acquired in a business combination is determined using the multi-period excess
earnings method, taking into account the historical chum rate of the acquired customer base. The valuation of customer relationships and brands
(when using MEEM valuation) takes into account a fair return on all other assets that support the generation of the related cash flows. The fair
value of reacquired rights and other intangible assets is based on the discounted cash flows expected to be derived from the use and eventual sale
of the assets.
(iii) Inventories
The fair value of inventories acquired in a business combination is determined based on its estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business
less the estimated costs of completion and sale, and a reasonable profit margin based on the effort required to complete and sell the inventories.
(iv) Trade and other receivables
The fair value of trade and other receivables is estimated at the present value of future cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the
reporting date. This fair value is determined for disclosure purposes or when acquired in a business combination.
(v) Provisions
Determining the fair value of acquired claims is subject to significant estimation. The fair value of these claims are recorded based on an estimate
of the likelihood, the expected timing and the amount of a potential cash outflow. Contrary to accounting for provisions under IAS 37, provisions
for civil and labour claims are also recognised for claims with a likelihood of less than probable, but more than remote. For income tax claims
HEINEKEN applies IAS 12, which requires recognition of provisions only when the likelihood of cash outflow is considered probable.

Fair value from normal business
(i) Investments in equity and debt securities
The fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, held-to-maturity investments and available-for-sale financial assets is
determined by reference to their quoted closing bid price at the reporting date or, if unquoted, determined using an appropriate valuation
technique. The fair value of held-to-maturity investments is determined for disclosure purposes only. In case the quoted price does not exist at the
date of exchange or in case the quoted price exists at the date of exchange but was not used as the cost, the investments are valued indirectly
based on discounted cash flow models.
(ii) Derivative financial instruments
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is based on their listed market price, if available. If a listed market price is not available, fair value is
in general estimated by discounting the difference between the cash flows based on contractual price and the cash flows based on current price for
the residual maturity of the contact using observable interest yield curves, basis spread and foreign exchange rates.
Fair values include the instrument’s credit risk and adjustments to take account of the credit risk of the HEINEKEN entity and counterparty
when appropriate.
(iii) Non-derivative financial instruments
Fair value, which is determined for disclosure purposes or when fair value hedge accounting is applied, is calculated based on the present value
of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date. For finance leases, the market rate of
interest is determined by reference to similar lease agreements.
Fair values include the instrument’s credit risk and adjustments to take account of the credit risk of the HEINEKEN entity and counterparty
when appropriate.

5. Operating segments
HEINEKEN distinguishes the following five reportable segments:
––Africa, Middle East & Eastern Europe*
––Americas
––Asia Pacific
––Europe
––Head Office and Other/eliminations
* Within the Africa, Middle East & Eastern Europe segment, Eastern Europe consists of Belarus and Russia.

The first four reportable segments as stated above are HEINEKEN’s business regions. These business regions are each managed separately
by a Regional President. The Regional President is directly accountable for the functioning of the segment’s assets, liabilities and results of the
region and reports regularly to the Executive Board (the chief operating decision-maker) to discuss operating activities, regional forecasts and
regional results. The Head Office operating segment falls directly under the responsibility of the Executive Board. The Executive Board reviews the
performance of the segments based on internal management reports on a monthly basis.
Information regarding the results of each reportable segment is included in the table on the next page. Performance is measured based on
operating profit (beia), as included in the internal management reports that are reviewed by the Executive Board. Operating profit beia has
replaced EBIT beia as key measure of profitability as of 1 January 2017. Operating profit better reflects the profitability that is under the direct
control of HEINEKEN. Exceptional items are defined as items of income and expense of such size, nature or incidence, that in the view of
management their disclosure is relevant to explain the performance of HEINEKEN for the period. Operating profit and operating profit (beia) are
not financial measures calculated in accordance with IFRS. Operating profit (beia) is used to measure performance as management believes that
this measurement is the most relevant in evaluating the results of the segments.
HEINEKEN has multiple distribution models to deliver goods to end customers. There is no reliance on major clients. Deliveries to end consumers
are done in some countries via own wholesalers or own pubs, in other markets directly and in some others via third parties. As such, distribution
models are country-specific and diverse across HEINEKEN. In addition, these various distribution models are not centrally managed or monitored.
Consequently, the Executive Board is not allocating resources and assessing the performance based on business type information and therefore no
segment information is provided on business type.
Inter-segment pricing is determined on an arm’s length basis. As net finance expenses and income tax expenses are monitored on a consolidated
level (and not on an individual regional basis) and regional presidents are not accountable for that, net finance expenses and income tax expenses
are not provided for the reportable segments.

5. Operating segments (continued)
Reconciliation of segment profit or loss
In the internal management reports, HEINEKEN measures its segmental performance primarily based on operating profit and operating profit beia
(before exceptional items and amortisation of acquisition-related intangible assets). Operating profit beia is a non-GAAP measure not calculated in
accordance with IFRS. Beia adjustments are also applied on other metrics. The presentation of these financial measures may not be comparable to
similarly titled measures reported by other companies due to differences in the ways the measures are calculated.
The table below presents the reconciliation of operating profit (beia) to profit before income tax.

The 2017 exceptional items and amortisation of acquisition-related intangibles in operating profit amounts to €407 million (2016: €785 million).
This amount consists of:
––€302 million (2016: €315 million) of amortisation of acquisition-related intangibles recorded in operating profit.
––€105 million (2016: €470 million) of exceptional items recorded in operating profit, of which €20 million in revenue (2016: nil), €93 million
of restructuring expenses (2016: €80 million), €19 million of reversal of impairments of property, plant and equipment (2016: €316 million
impairment loss of which €286 million related to The Democratic Republic of Congo), €72 million of acquisition and integration costs
(2016: €8 million) and €61 million of other exceptional net benefits (2016: €66 million expense). Other exceptional net benefits include
the gain on sale of non-beer and cider wholesale operations in the Netherlands.

6. Acquisitions and disposals of subsidiaries
Acquisition of Brasil Kirin
On 13 February 2017, HEINEKEN announced that it had entered into an agreement with Kirin Holdings Company, Limited to acquire Brasil
Kirin Holding S.A. (‘Brasil Kirin’), one of the largest beer and soft drinks producers in Brazil, through its wholly owned subsidiary Bavaria S.A.
The acquisition transforms HEINEKEN’s existing business across the country by extending its footprint, increasing scale and further strengthening
its brand portfolio. The transaction completed on 31 May 2017 as from which date Brasil Kirin is consolidated within HEINEKEN. The total
consideration paid by HEINEKEN to Kirin for all the shares was €594 million, mainly paid in cash.
In the condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the six-month period ended 30 June 2017, the major classes of consideration
transferred and the recognised provisional amounts of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date of 31 May 2017, have
been disclosed. IFRS 3 requires the acquirer to retrospectively adjust the provisional amounts recognised at the acquisition date to reflect new
information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. The following table summarises the revised purchase
price allocation as per 31 December 2017 for the acquisition of Brasil Kirin:

Heineken N.V. Annual Report 2017

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
The main cause for the adjustments is that HEINEKEN had a short period to determine the opening balance, the complexity of the business and
the high number of existing labour, civil and tax claims acquired. Per 31 December 2017 the provisional accounting period has been closed for all
assets and liabilities, except for completion of the assessment on labour, tax and civil claims acquired given the aforementioned reason.
The goodwill is attributable to earnings beyond the period over which intangible assets are amortised, workforce, expected synergies and future
customers. The goodwill for Brasil Kirin could potentially be tax deductible in the future.

Acquisition of Punch
On 15 December 2016, HEINEKEN announced that following Vine Acquisitions Limited’s announcement of a recommended cash offer for Punch
Taverns plc (‘Punch’), HEINEKEN through HEINEKEN UK had agreed a back-to-back deal with Vine Acquisitions to acquire Punch Securitisation
A (‘Punch A’), comprising approximately 1,900 pubs across the UK. The transaction completed on 29 August 2017 as from which date Punch is
consolidated within HEINEKEN. HEINEKEN believes that there is compelling strategic rationale for enlarging its existing pub business through the
acquisition of Punch A. HEINEKEN considers pubs to be an integral part of British culture and believes that high-quality, well invested pubs run by
skilled and motivated operators will continue to prosper.
HEINEKEN has paid an aggregate consideration of GBP308 million (€331 million) for all shares in Punch A. This consideration is mainly paid
in cash.
The following table summarises the consideration transferred and the recognised amounts of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the
acquisition date:

HEINEKEN considers the measurement period for the acquisition of Punch to be closed as per 31 December 2017. Any adjustments afterwards will
be recognised in the consolidated income statement.
In total €37 million of acquisition-related costs have been recognised for Kirin and Punch in the income statement for the period ended
31 December 2017.
The amount of revenue for the acquisition of Brasil Kirin and Punch after obtaining control amounts to €684 million and €97 million respectively;
the amount of profit recognised after obtaining control amounts to €17 million and €28 million respectively. Would the acquisitions have taken
place on 1 January 2017, revenue and profit for HEINEKEN would have been €22.4 billion and €2.1 billion respectively.

In 2017, no impairment loss was charged to profit or loss.
In 2016 impairment losses of €295 million were charged to profit or loss. These impairment losses were mainly related to The Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC). A slowdown of the expected future economic growth in DRC due to lower commodity prices, power constraints
and lower investments and consumption resulting from political uncertainties, resulted in an impairment of assets in the cash generating unit
(CGU). The impairment primarily related to property, plant and equipment and has been recorded on the line ‘Amortisation, depreciation and
impairments’ in the Income Statement. The CGU DRC is part of the Africa, Middle East and Eastern Europe segment. The determination of the
recoverable amount of these assets was based on a fair value less costs of disposal (FVLCD) valuation. The FVLCD was based on a discounted
10-year cash flow forecast (level 3). The key assumptions used to determine the cash flows are based on market expectations and management’s
best estimates. See the table below for the key assumptions used for the impairment in DRC in 2016:

Sales volume growth (CAGR)
Cost inflation

Property, plant and equipment under construction
P, P & E under construction mainly relates to extension of brewing capacity in various countries.

Brands, customer-related and contract-based intangibles
The main brands capitalised are the brands acquired in various acquisitions such as Fosters, Strongbow, Lagunitas, Dos Equis, Tiger and Bintang.
The main customer-related and contract-based intangibles relate to customer relationships with retailers in Mexico and Asia Pacific (constituted
either by way of a contractual agreement or by way of non-contractual relations) and reacquired rights.

Impairment tests for cash-generating units containing goodwill
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill in respect of Europe, the Americas (excluding Brazil) and Asia Pacific is allocated and monitored on
a regional basis. For Brazil and subsidiaries within Africa, Middle East and Eastern Europe and Head Office, goodwill is allocated and monitored on
an individual country basis. The carrying amounts of goodwill allocated to each (group of) CGU(s) are as follows:

Throughout the year, goodwill increased mainly due to the Brasil Kirin acquisition offset by net foreign currency differences.
The recoverable amounts of the (group of) CGUs are based on the higher of the fair value less costs of disposal and value in use calculations.
Value in use was determined by discounting the future cash flows generated from the continuing use of the unit using a pre-tax discount rate.
The key assumptions used for the value in use calculations are as follows:
––Cash flows were projected based on actual operating results and the three-year business plan. Cash flows for a further seven-year period (except for
Europe, where a further two-year period was applied) were extrapolated using expected annual per country volume growth rates, which are based on
external sources. Management believes that this period is justified due to the long-term development of the local beer business and past experiences.
––The beer price growth per year after the first three-year period is assumed to be at specific per country expected annual long-term inflation, based
on external sources.
––Cash flows after the first 10-year (Europe five-year) period were extrapolated using a perpetual growth rate equal to the expected annual
long-term inflation, in order to calculate the terminal recoverable amount.
––A per CGU-specific pre-tax Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) was applied in determining the recoverable amount of the units.
The values assigned to the key assumptions used for the value in use calculations are as follows:

The outcome of these impairment tests in 2017 did not result in an impairment loss (2016: nil) being charged to profit or loss.

Sensitivity to changes in assumptions
The outcome of a sensitivity analysis of a 100 basis points adverse change in key assumptions (lower growth rates or higher discount rates
respectively) did not result in a materially different outcome of the impairment test.

The increase in long-term prepayments is mainly related to deposits paid for existing legal proceedings which were inherited as part of the Brasil
Kirin acquisition (refer to note 6).
The other receivables mainly originate from the acquisition of the beer operations of FEMSA and represent a receivable on the Brazilian authorities
on which interest is calculated in accordance with Brazilian legislation. Collection of this receivable is expected to be beyond a period of five years.
A part of the aforementioned receivable qualifies for indemnification towards FEMSA.
HEINEKEN has interests in several entities where it has less than significant influence. These are classified as available-for-sale investments and
valued based on their share price when publicly listed. For investments that are not listed fair values are established using multiples. Debt securities
(which are interest-bearing) with a carrying amount of €15 million (2016: €15 million) are included in available-for-sale investments.

Sensitivity analysis – equity price risk
As at 31 December 2017, an amount of €396 million (2016: €342 million) of available-for-sale investments and investments held for trading is listed on
stock exchanges. An increase or decrease of 1% in the share price at the reporting date would not result in a material impact on HEINEKEN’s financial position.

Net tax assets/(liabilities)

Of the total net deferred tax assets of €768 million as at 31 December 2017 (2016: €1,011 million), €253 million (2016: €405 million) is recognised
in respect of subsidiaries in various countries where there have been tax losses in the current or preceding period. Management’s projections support
the assumption that it is probable that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to utilise these deferred tax assets.
This judgement is performed annually and based on budgets and business plans for the coming years, including planned commercial initiatives.
No deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of undistributed earnings of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, with a net impact of
€75 million (2016: €58 million). This because HEINEKEN is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences, and it is probable
that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Tax losses carried forward
HEINEKEN has tax losses carried forward of €3,593 million as at 31 December 2017 (2016: €2,370 million), out of which €137 million (2016: €145 million)
expires in the following five years. €434 million (2016: €338 million) will expire after five years and €3,023 million (2016: €1,887 million) can be carried forward
indefinitely. Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of tax losses carried forward of €1,619 million (2016: €637 million) as it is not probable
that taxable profit will be available to offset these losses. The increase in the amount of tax losses carried forward relates mainly to the acquisition of Brasil Kirin.

HEINEKEN operates in a number of territories where there is limited availability of foreign currency resulting in restrictions on remittances.
Mainly as a result of these restrictions, ¤208 million of cash included in cash and cash equivalents is restricted for use by the Company, yet available
for use in the relevant subsidiary’s day-to-day operations.

22. Capital and reserves
Share capital
As at 31 December 2017, the issued share capital comprised 576,002,613 ordinary shares (2016: 576,002,613). The ordinary shares have a par
value of €1.60. All issued shares are fully paid. The share capital as at 31 December 2017 amounted to €922 million (2016: €922 million).
The Company’s authorised capital amounts to €2,500 million, consisting of 1,562,500,000 shares.
The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends as declared from time to time and are entitled to one vote per share at meetings of
the Company. In respect of the Company’s shares that are held by HEINEKEN, rights are suspended.

Share premium
As at 31 December 2017, the share premium amounted to €2,701 million (2016: €2,701 million).

Translation reserve
The translation reserve comprises foreign currency differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations of
HEINEKEN (excluding amounts attributable to non-controlling interests) as well as value changes of the hedging instruments in the net investment
hedges. HEINEKEN considers this a legal reserve.

Hedging reserve
This reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow hedging instruments where the hedged
transaction has not yet occurred. HEINEKEN considers this a legal reserve.

Fair value reserve
This reserve comprises the cumulative net change in the fair value of available-for-sale investments until the investment is derecognised or
impaired. HEINEKEN considers this a legal reserve.

Other legal reserves
These reserves relate to the share of profit of joint ventures and associates over the distribution of which HEINEKEN does not have control.
The movement in these reserves reflects retained earnings of joint ventures and associates minus dividends received. In case of a legal or other
restriction which means that retained earnings of subsidiaries cannot be freely distributed, a legal reserve is recognised for the restricted part.
Furthermore, part of the reserve comprises a legal reserve for capitalised development costs.

Reserve for own shares
The reserve for the Company’s own shares comprises the cost of the Company’s shares held by HEINEKEN. As at 31 December 2017, HEINEKEN
held 5,808,418 of the Company’s shares (2016: 6,321,833).

Basic earnings per share
The calculation of basic earnings per share for the period ended 31 December 2017 is based on the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of
the Company (net profit) of €1,935 million (2016: €1,540 million) and a weighted average number of ordinary shares – basic outstanding during
the year ended 31 December 2017 of 570,074,335 (2016: 569,737,210). Basic earnings per share for the year amounted to €3.39 (2016: €2.70).

Diluted earnings per share
The calculation of diluted earnings per share for the period ended 31 December 2017 is based on the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders
of the Company (net profit) of €1,935 million (2016: €1,540 million) and a weighted average number of ordinary shares – basic outstanding after
adjustment for the dilutive effect of share-based payment plan obligations of 570,652,111 (2016: 570,370,392). Diluted earnings per share for
the year amounted to €3.39 (2016: €2.70).

The difference between the total repayment of loans and borrowings in the above tables and the total repayment of loans and borrowings
in the consolidated statement of cash flows is caused by the settlement of short-term derivative liabilities of €39 million. As at 31 December
2017, the value of derivative assets used by HEINEKEN to manage the currency denomination of the interest-bearing debts was €117 million
(2016: €242 million). The change in the value is caused by fair value movements.

Financing headroom
The committed financing headroom at Group level was approximately €4.0 billion as at 31 December 2017 and consisted of the undrawn
revolving credit facility and centrally available cash, minus the amount of commercial paper in issue at Group level.

Incurrence covenant
HEINEKEN has an incurrence covenant in some of its financing facilities. This incurrence covenant is calculated by dividing net debt (excluding the
market value of cross-currency interest rate swaps) by EBITDA (beia) (both based on proportional consolidation of joint ventures and including
acquisitions made in 2017 on a pro-forma basis). As at 31 December 2017 this ratio was 2.4 (2016: 2.3). If the ratio would be beyond a level of
3.5, the incurrence covenant would prevent HEINEKEN from conducting further significant debt financed acquisitions.

HEINEKEN provides employees in the Netherlands with an average pay pension plan based on earnings up to the legal tax limit. Indexation of
accrued benefits is conditional on the funded status of the pension fund. HEINEKEN pays contributions to the fund up to a maximum level agreed
with the Board of the pension fund and has no obligation to make additional contributions in case of a funding deficit. In 2017, HEINEKEN’s cash
contribution to the Dutch pension plan was at the maximum level. The same level is expected to be paid in 2018.

Heineken N.V. Annual Report 2017

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

26. Employee benefits (continued)
HEINEKEN’s UK plan (Scottish & Newcastle pension plan ‘SNPP’) was closed to future accrual in 2010 and the liabilities thus relate to past service
before plan closure. Based on the triennial review finalised in early 2016, HEINEKEN has renewed the funding plan (until 31 May 2023) including
an annual Company contribution of GBP37.5 million in 2017, thereafter increasing with GBP1.7 million per year. Deficit payments as of 2019 will
be reviewed and may be replaced following the upcoming triennial valuation. No additional liability has been recognised as the net present value
of the minimum funding requirement does not exceed the net obligation.
Other countries where HEINEKEN offers a defined benefit plan to (former) employees include: Austria (closed in 2007 to new entrants), Belgium,
France, Greece (closed in 2014 to new entrants), Ireland (closed in 2012 to all future accrual), Jamaica (closed in 2017 to all future accrual), Mexico
(plan changed to hybrid defined contribution for majority of employees in 2014), Nigeria (closed to new entrants in 2007), Portugal, Spain (closed
to management in 2010 and changed to a defined contribution plan for actives in 2017) and Switzerland.
The vast majority of benefit payments are from pension funds that are held in trusts (or equivalent); however, there is a small portion where
HEINEKEN meets the benefit payment obligation as it falls due. Plan assets held in trusts are governed by Trustee Boards composed of
HEINEKEN representatives and independent and/or member representation, in accordance with local regulations and practice in each country.
The relationship and division of responsibility between HEINEKEN and the Trustee Board (or equivalent) including investment decisions and
contribution schedules are carried out in accordance with the plan’s regulations.
In other countries, retirement benefits are provided to employees via defined contribution plans.
Other long-term employee benefits mainly relate to long-term bonus plans, termination benefits, medical plans and jubilee benefits.

The HEINEKEN pension funds monitor the mix of debt and equity securities in their investment portfolios based on market expectations.
Material investments within the portfolio are managed on an individual basis. Through its defined benefit pension plans, HEINEKEN is exposed to a
number of risks, the most significant which are detailed below:

Asset volatility
The plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields. If the return on the plan assets is less than the
return on the liabilities implied by this assumption, this will create a deficit. Both the Netherlands and the UK plans hold a significant proportion of
equities, which are expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term, while providing volatility and risk in the short term.
In the Netherlands, an Asset-Liability Matching (ALM) study is performed at least on a triennial basis. The ALM study is the basis for the strategic
investment policies and the (long-term) strategic investment mix. This resulted in a strategic asset mix comprising 38% equity securities, 40%
bonds, 7% property and real estate and 15% other investments. The objective is to hedge currency risk on the US dollar, Japanese yen and British
pound for 50% of the equity exposure in the strategic investment mix.
In the UK, an Asset-Liability Matching study is performed at least on a triennial basis. The ALM study is the basis for the strategic investment
policies and the (long-term) strategic investment mix. This resulted in a strategic asset mix comprising 45% of plan assets in liability driven
investments, 18% in absolute return, 16% in equities (global and emerging markets), 5.5% in alternatives and 15.5% in private markets.
The objective is to hedge 100% of currency risk on developed non-GBP equity market exposures in the strategic investment mix.

Interest rate risk
A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the plans’ fixed
rate instruments holdings.
In the Netherlands, interest rate risk is partly managed through fixed income investments. These investments match the liabilities for 22.9%
(2016: 22.9%). In the UK, interest rate risk is partly managed through the use of a mixture of fixed income investments and interest rate swap
instruments. These investments and instruments match 32% of the interest rate sensitivity of the total liabilities (2016: 28%).

26. Employee benefits (continued)
Inflation risk
Some of the pension obligations are linked to inflation. Higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities, although in most cases caps on the level of
inflationary increases are in place to protect the plan against extreme inflation. The majority of the plan assets are either unaffected by or loosely
correlated with inflation, meaning that an increase in inflation will increase the deficit.
HEINEKEN provides employees in the Netherlands with an average pay pension plan, whereby indexation of accrued benefits is conditional on the
funded status of the pension fund. In the UK, inflation is partly managed through the use of a mixture of inflation-linked derivative instruments.
These instruments match 35% of the inflation-linked liabilities (2016: 41%).

Life expectancy
The majority of the plans’ obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase
in the plans’ liabilities. This is particularly significant in the UK plan, where inflation-linked increases result in higher sensitivity to changes in
life expectancy. In 2015, the Trustee of SNPP implemented a longevity hedge to remove the risk of a higher increase in life expectancy than
anticipated for the 2015 population pensioners.

Principal actuarial assumptions as at the balance sheet date
Based on the significance of the Dutch and UK pension plans compared with the other plans, the table below only includes the major actuarial
assumptions for those two plans as at 31 December:

Assumptions regarding future mortality rates are based on published statistics and mortality tables. For the Netherlands, the rates are obtained
from the ‘AG-Prognosetafel 2016’, fully generational. Correction factors (2016) from ‘Sprenkels en Verschuren’ are applied on these rates. For the
UK, the future mortality rates are obtained by applying the Continuous Mortality Investigation 2014 projection model with an assumed long
term rate of 1.5% p.a. to the Self-Administered Pension Schemes Series 2 (year of birth) tables with a 112% (male)/109% (female) weighting for
pensioners and a 105% (male)/106% (female) weighting for non-pensioners.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period is 18 years.
HEINEKEN expects the 2018 contributions to be paid for the defined benefit plans to be in line with 2017.

Sensitivity analysis
Reasonably possible changes at the reporting date to one of the relevant actuarial assumptions, holding other assumptions constant, would have
affected the defined benefit obligation by the amounts shown below:
31 December 2017

27. Share-based payments – Long-Term Variable Award
HEINEKEN has a performance-based share plan (Long-Term Variable award (LTV)) for the Executive Board and senior management. Under this
LTV plan, share rights are conditionally awarded to incumbents on an annual basis. The vesting of these rights is subject to the performance of
Heineken N.V. on specific internal performance conditions and continued service over a three-year period.
The performance conditions for LTV 2015-2017, LTV 2016-2018 and LTV 2017-2019 are the same for the Executive Board and senior
management and comprise solely of internal financial measures, being Organic Revenue Growth, Organic operating profit (as of LTV 2017-2019.
LTV 2015-2017 and 2016-2018 are on Organic EBIT beia growth), Earnings Per Share (EPS) beia growth and Free Operating Cash Flow.
At target performance, 100% of the awarded share rights vest. At threshold performance, 50% of the awarded share rights vest. At maximum
performance, 200% of the awarded share rights vest for the Executive Board as well as senior managers contracted by the US, Mexico, Brazil and
Singapore, and 175% vest for all other senior managers. As per LTIP 2017-2019 the maximum performance is set at 200% for all senior managers.
The performance period for the aforementioned plans are:

31 December 2018

2017-2019

1 January 2017

31 December 2019

The vesting date for the Executive Board is shortly after the publication of the annual results of 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively and for senior
management on 1 April 2018, 2019 and 2020 respectively.
As HEINEKEN will withhold the tax related to vesting on behalf of the individual employees, the number of Heineken N.V. shares to be received will
be a net number. The share rights are not dividend-bearing during the performance period. The fair value has been adjusted for expected dividends
by applying a discount based on the dividend policy and historical dividend payouts, during the vesting period.
The number of share rights granted and share price at grant date are as follows:
Grant date/employees entitled

Under the LTV 2014-2016, a total of 61,508 (gross) shares vested for the Executive Board and 740,873 (gross) shares vested for senior
management. The number of shares vested for the Executive Board only relates to Mr. Jean-François van Boxmeer, as Ms. Laurence Debroux
received LTI as per LTIP 2015-2017.
Based on the performance conditions, it is expected that approximately 689,495 shares of the LTV 2015-2017 will vest in 2018 for senior
management and the Executive Board.
The number, as adjusted for the expected performance for the various awards, and weighted average share price per share under the LTV of senior

Restructuring
The provision for restructuring of €104 million (2016: €99 million) mainly relates to restructuring programmes in Spain and the Netherlands.
For large restructurings, management assesses the timing of the costs to be incurred, which influences the classification as current or noncurrent liabilities.

Claims and litigation
The provision for claims and litigation of €403 million mainly relates to the litigation inherited from the acquisition of Brasil Kirin, as well as the
beer operations of FEMSA in 2010 (refer to note 32). Management assesses provisions for claims and litigation on an ongoing basis. The outcome
depends on future events, which are by nature uncertain. In assessing the likely outcome of lawsuits and tax disputes etc., management bases its
assessment on internal and external legal assistance and established precedents.

Other provisions
Included are, among others, surety and guarantees provided of €42 million (2016: €35 million) and provisions for taxes of €498 million
(2016: €56 million). The increase mainly relates to the acquisition of Brasil Kirin (refer to note 4 and 6) as tax legislation in Brazil is highly complex
and subject to interpretation. The timing of the cash outflows for these provisions is uncertain.

The returnable packaging liability is based on the expected return of delivered returnable packaging materials with a deposit such as bottles,
crates and kegs, where HEINEKEN has the legal or constructive obligation to buy back the materials. The expected return is determined based on
measured circulation times and historical losses of returnable packaging materials in the market.

30. Financial risk management and financial instruments
Overview
HEINEKEN has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments, as they arise in the normal course of HEINEKEN’s business:
––Credit risk
––Liquidity risk
––Market risk
This note presents information about HEINEKEN’s exposure to each of the above risks, and it summarises HEINEKEN’s policies and processes
that are in place for measuring and managing risk, including those related to capital management. Further quantitative disclosures are included
throughout these consolidated financial statements.

Risk management framework
The Executive Board, under the supervision of the Supervisory Board, has overall responsibility and sets rules for HEINEKEN’s risk management and
control systems. They are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and HEINEKEN’s activities. The Executive Board oversees the
adequacy and functioning of the entire system of risk management and internal control, assisted by HEINEKEN Group departments.
The Global Treasury function focuses primarily on the management of financial risk and financial resources. Some of the risk management
strategies include the use of derivatives, primarily in the form of spot and forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps, but options can be
used as well. It is HEINEKEN’s policy that no speculative transactions are entered into.

Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to HEINEKEN if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations,
and it arises principally from HEINEKEN’s receivables from customers and investment securities.
All local operations are required to comply with the principles contained within the Global Credit Policy and develop local credit management
procedures accordingly. HEINEKEN regularly reviews and updates the Global Credit Policy ensuring that adequate controls are in place to mitigate
any identified risks in respect of customer credit risk.
As at the balance sheet date, there were no significant concentrations of credit risk. The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the
carrying amount of each financial instrument, including derivative financial instruments, in the consolidated statement of financial position.

Loans and advances to customers
HEINEKEN’s exposure to credit risk is mainly influenced by the individual characteristics of each customer. HEINEKEN’s loans and receivables
include loans and advances to customers, issued based on a loan or advance contract. Loans and advances to customers are secured by, among
others, rights on property or intangible assets, such as the right to take possession of the premises of the customer. On loans to customers interest
rates calculated by HEINEKEN are at least based on the risk-free rate plus a margin, which takes into account the risk profile of the customer and
value of security given.
In a few countries HEINEKEN provides guarantees to third parties who issue loans to our customers.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

30. Financial risk management and financial instruments (continued)
Trade and other receivables
HEINEKEN’s local management has credit policies in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. Under the credit
policies, all customers requiring credit over a certain amount are reviewed and new customers are analysed individually for creditworthiness before
HEINEKEN’s standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered. HEINEKEN’s review can include external ratings, where available,
and in some cases bank references. Credit limits are established for each customer and these limits are reviewed regularly. Customers that fail to
meet HEINEKEN’s benchmark creditworthiness may transact with HEINEKEN only on a prepayment basis.
In monitoring customer credit risk customers are, on a country basis, grouped according to their credit characteristics, including whether they
are an individual or legal entity, which type of distribution channel they represent, geographic location, industry, ageing profile, maturity and
existence of previous financial difficulties. Customers that are graded as high risk are placed on a restricted customer list, and sales are made on
strict payment conditions only with approval of management. In addition HEINEKEN issued an Anti-Money Laundering and Sanction Letter to
safeguard our reputation and operations. HEINEKEN considers it important to know with whom business is done and from whom HEINEKEN is
receiving payments.
HEINEKEN has multiple distribution models to deliver goods to end customers. Deliveries are done via own wholesalers, directly or via third parties,
depending the countries specifics. As such distribution models are country-specific and diverse across HEINEKEN, the results and the balance
sheet items cannot be split between types of customers on a consolidated basis. The various distribution models are also not centrally managed
or monitored.

Allowances
HEINEKEN establishes allowances for impairment of loans, trade and other receivables that represent the estimate of incurred losses. The main
components of these allowances are specific loss components that relates to individually exposures, and a collective loss component established for
groups of similar customers in respect of losses that have been incurred but not yet identified. The collective loss allowance is determined based on
historical data of payment statistics.

Investments
HEINEKEN limits its exposure to credit risk by only investing available cash balances in deposits and liquid securities and only with counterparties
that have strong credit ratings. HEINEKEN actively monitors these credit ratings.

Guarantees
HEINEKEN’s policy is to avoid issuing guarantees where possible unless this leads to substantial benefits for HEINEKEN. In cases where HEINEKEN
does provide guarantees, such as to banks for loans (to third parties), HEINEKEN aims to receive security from the third party.
Heineken N.V. has issued a joint and several liability statement to the provisions of Section 403, Part 9, Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code with respect
to legal entities established in the Netherlands. Refer to Note 42 of the Company financial statements.

Exposure to credit risk
The carrying amount of financial assets and guarantees to banks for loans represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to
credit risk at the reporting date was:

The allowance accounts in respect of trade and other receivables and held-to-maturity investments are used to record impairment losses, unless
HEINEKEN is satisfied that no recovery of the amount owing is possible; at that point, the amount considered irrecoverable is written off against
the financial asset.

Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that HEINEKEN will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled
by delivering cash or another financial asset. HEINEKEN’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have
sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking
damage to HEINEKEN’s reputation.
HEINEKEN has a clear focus on ensuring sufficient access to capital markets to finance long-term growth and to refinance maturing debt
obligations. Financing strategies, including the diversification of funding sources are under continuous evaluation (information about borrowing
facilities is presented in Note 25). In addition, HEINEKEN seeks to align the maturity profile of its long-term debts with its forecasted cash flow
generation. Strong cost and cash management and controls over investment proposals are in place to ensure effective and efficient allocation of
financial resources.

Heineken N.V. Annual Report 2017

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
The total carrying amount and contractual cash flows of derivatives are included in trade and other receivables (refer to note 20), other
investments (refer to note 17), trade and other payables (refer to note 29) and non-current non-interest-bearing liabilities (refer to note 25).

Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices and equity prices, will adversely
affect HEINEKEN’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control
market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
HEINEKEN uses derivatives in the ordinary course of business, and also incurs financial liabilities, in order to manage market risks. Generally,
HEINEKEN seeks to apply hedge accounting or make use of natural hedges in order to minimise the effects of foreign currency fluctuations in profit
or loss.
Derivatives that can be used are interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements, caps and floors, commodity swaps, spot and forward exchange
contracts and options. Transactions are entered into with a limited number of counterparties with strong credit ratings. Foreign currency, interest
rate and commodity hedging operations are governed by internal policies and rules approved and monitored by the Executive Board.

Foreign currency risk
HEINEKEN is exposed to foreign currency risk on (future) sales, (future) purchases, borrowings and dividends that are denominated in a currency
other than the respective functional currencies of HEINEKEN entities. The main currencies that give rise to this risk are the US dollar, Mexican peso,
Nigerian naira, British pound, Vietnamese dong and Euro. In 2017, the transactional exchange risk was hedged in line with the hedging policy
to the extent possible, the resulting impact from currency movements was therefore partly mitigated. The negative translational impact was
more profound.
In managing foreign currency risk, HEINEKEN aims to ensure the availability of these foreign currencies and to reduce the impact of short-term
fluctuations on earnings. Over the longer term, however, permanent changes in foreign exchange rates and the availability of foreign currencies,
especially in emerging markets, will have an impact on profit.
HEINEKEN hedges up to 90% of its net US dollar export cash flows on the basis of rolling cash flow forecasts in respect to forecasted sales and
purchases. Cash flows in other foreign currencies are also hedged on the basis of rolling cash flow forecasts. HEINEKEN mainly uses forward
exchange contracts to hedge its foreign currency risk. The majority of the forward exchange contracts have maturities of less than one year after
the balance sheet date.
HEINEKEN has a clear policy on hedging transactional exchange risks, which postpones the impact on financial results. Translation exchange
risks are hedged to a limited extent, as the underlying currency positions are generally considered to be long term in nature. The result of the net
investment hedging is recognised in the translation reserve, as can be seen in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
It is HEINEKEN’s policy to provide intra-HEINEKEN financing in the functional currency of subsidiaries where possible to prevent foreign currency
exposure on a subsidiary level. The resulting exposure at Group level is hedged by means of foreign currency denominated external debts and by
forward exchange contracts. Intra-HEINEKEN financing in foreign currencies is mainly in British pounds, US dollars, Polish zloty and New Zealand
dollar. In some cases, HEINEKEN elects to treat intra-HEINEKEN financing with a permanent character as equity and does not hedge the foreign
currency exposure.
HEINEKEN maintains debt in foreign currencies like US dollar and British pound to hedge local operations, which generate cash flows that have the
same respective functional currencies or have functional currencies that are closely correlated. Corresponding interest on these borrowings is also
denominated in currencies that match the cash flows generated by the underlying operations of HEINEKEN.
In respect of other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of HEINEKEN and the various
foreign operations, HEINEKEN ensures that its net exposure is kept to an acceptable level by buying or selling foreign currencies at spot rates when
necessary to address short-term imbalances.

Sensitivity analysis
A 10% strengthening of the US dollar against the Euro or, in case of the Euro, a strengthening of the Euro against all other currencies as at
31 December would have affected the value of financial assets and liabilities (related to transactional exposure) recorded on the balance sheet
and would have therefore decreased (increased) equity and profit by the amounts shown above. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in
particular interest rates, remain constant.
A 10% weakening of the US dollar against the Euro or, in case of the Euro, a weakening of the Euro against all other currencies as at 31 December
would have had the equal but opposite effect on the basis that all other variables remain constant.

Interest rate risk
In managing interest rate risk, HEINEKEN aims to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations on earnings. Over the longer term, however,
permanent changes in interest rates would have an impact on profit.
HEINEKEN opts for a mix of fixed and variable interest rates in its financing operations, combined with the use of interest rate instruments.
Currently, HEINEKEN’s interest rate position is more weighted towards fixed than floating. Interest rate instruments that can be used are
(cross-currency) interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements, caps and floors.
Swap maturity follows the maturity of the related loans and borrowings which have swap rates for the fixed leg ranging from 2.3 to 6.5% (2016:
from 3.8 to 6.5%).

Cash flow sensitivity analysis for variable rate instruments
HEINEKEN applies fair value hedge accounting on certain fixed rate financial liabilities and designates derivatives as hedging instruments.
A change of 100 basis points in interest rates constantly applied during the reporting period would have increased (decreased) equity and profit or
loss by the amounts shown below (after tax). This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant and
excludes any possible change in fair value of derivatives at period-end because of a change in interest rates. This analysis is performed on the same

Commodity price risk
Commodity price risk is the risk that changes in commodity prices will affect HEINEKEN’s income. The objective of commodity price risk
management is to manage and control commodity risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk. The main
commodity exposure relates to the purchase of cans, glass bottles, malt and utilities. Commodity price risk is in principle addressed by negotiating
fixed prices in supplier contracts with various contract durations. So far, commodity hedging with financial counterparties by HEINEKEN has
been limited to aluminium hedging and to a limited extent gas, sugar and grains hedging, which are done in accordance with risk policies.
HEINEKEN does not enter into commodity contracts other than to meet HEINEKEN’s expected usage and sale requirements. As at 31 December
2017, the market value of commodity swaps was €77 million positive (2016: €11 million positive).

The periods in which the cash flows associated with forward exchange contracts that are cash flow hedges are expected to impact profit or loss is
typically one or two months earlier than the occurrence of the cash flows as in the above table.
HEINEKEN has entered into several cross-currency interest rate swaps which have been designated as cash flow hedges to hedge the foreign
exchange rate risk on the principal amount and future interest payments of its US dollar borrowings. The borrowings and the cross-currency interest
rate swaps have the same critical terms.

In 2017 HEINEKEN has entered into several cross-currency interest rate swaps which have been designated as fair value hedges to hedge the
foreign exchange rate risk on the principal amount and future interest payments of its certain US dollar borrowings. The borrowings and the
cross-currency interest rate swaps have the same critical terms.
The loss arising on derivatives as designated hedging instruments in fair value hedges amounts to €48 million. The gain arising on the adjustment
for the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk in a designated fair value hedge accounting relationship amounts to €48 million.

Net investment hedges
HEINEKEN hedges its investments in certain subsidiaries by entering into local currency denominated borrowings and cross-currency interest rate
swaps, which mitigate the foreign currency translation risk arising from the subsidiaries net assets. These borrowings and swaps are designated as
net investment hedges and fully effective as such there was no ineffectiveness recognised in profit and loss in 2017 (2016: nil). The fair value of
these borrowings at 31 December 2017 was €475 million (2016: €506 million) and the market value of these swaps at 31 December 2017 was
€8 million negative (2016: nil).

Capital management
There were no major changes in HEINEKEN’s approach to capital management during the year. The Executive Board’s policy is to maintain a
strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business and acquisitions.
Capital is herein defined as equity attributable to equity holders of the Company (total equity minus non-controlling interests).
HEINEKEN is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements other than the legal reserves explained in note 22. Shares are purchased to
meet the requirements of the share-based payment awards, as further explained in note 27.

Fair values
For bank loans and finance lease liabilities the carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value. The fair value of the unsecured
bond issues as at 31 December 2017 was €12,660 million (2016: €11,292 million) and the carrying amount was €11,948 million
(2016: €10,683 million). The fair value of the other interest-bearing liabilities as at 31 December 2017 was €1,535 million (2016: €1,662 million)
and the carrying amount was €1,515 million (2016: €1,597 million).

Basis for determining fair values
The significant methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments are discussed in note 4.

During the period ended 31 December 2017 there were no significant transfers between the three levels of the fair value hierarchy.

Level 2
HEINEKEN determines level 2 fair values for over-the-counter securities based on broker quotes. The fair values of simple over-the-counter derivative
financial instruments are determined by using valuation techniques. These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data
where available.
The fair value of derivatives is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on observable interest yield curves, basis
spread and foreign exchange rates. These calculations are tested for reasonableness by comparing the outcome of the internal valuation with the
valuation received from the counterparty. Fair values reflect the credit risk of the instrument and include adjustments to take into account the credit
risk of HEINEKEN and counterparty when appropriate.

HEINEKEN leases offices, warehouses, pubs, cars and other equipment in the ordinary course of business.
Raw material contracts include long-term purchase contracts with suppliers in which prices are fixed or will be agreed based upon predefined price
formulas. These contracts mainly relate to malt, bottles and cans. The raw materials purchase commitments relate to purchase contracts with
EMPAQUE which has become a third party supplier after the disposal in 2015.
During the year ended 31 December 2017, €364 million (2016: €302 million) was recognised as an expense in profit or loss in respect of operating
leases and rent.
Other off-balance sheet obligations include energy, distribution and service contracts.
Committed bank facilities are credit facilities on which a commitment fee is paid as compensation for the bank’s requirement to reserve capital.
The bank is legally obliged to provide the facility under the terms and conditions of the agreement.

32. Contingencies
HEINEKEN’s significant contingencies are described below.

Tax
HEINEKEN operates in a high number of jurisdictions, and is subject to a wide variety of taxes per jurisdiction. Tax legislation can be highly
complex and subject to interpretation. As a result, HEINEKEN is required to exercise significant judgement in the recognition of taxes payable and
determination of tax contingencies.
The tax contingencies mainly relate to tax positions in Latin America and include a large number of cases with a risk assessment lower
than probable but higher than remote. Assessing the amount of tax contingencies is highly judgemental, and the timing of possible
outflows is uncertain. Our best estimate of tax related contingent liabilities is €897 million (2016: €443 million), out of which €170 million
(2016: €188 million) qualifies for indemnification. For several tax contingencies that were part of acquisitions, an amount of €382 million
(2016: €98 million) has been recognised as provisions in the balance sheet.

Other contingencies
HEINEKEN also has other contingencies, for which, in the opinion of management and its legal counsel, the risk of loss is possible but not probable.
Contingencies involve inherent uncertainties including, but not limited to, court rulings, negotiations between affected parties and governmental
actions. The most significant contingencies relate to civil cases in Brazil. Management’s best estimate of the financial effect for these cases
is €57 million (2016: €14 million). For the other contingencies that were part of acquisitions, an amount of €49 million (2016: nil) has been
recognised on balance.

mainly relates to the acquisition of Brasil Kirin.

The matching share entitlements for each year are based on the performance in that year. The Executive Board members receive 25% of their
STV pay in (investment) shares. In addition they have the opportunity to indicate before year-end whether they wish to receive up to another
25% of their STV pay in (investment) shares. All (investment) shares are restricted for sale for five calendar years, after which they are matched
1:1 by (matching) shares. For 2017 the Executive Board members did not elect to receive additional (investment) shares, hence the ‘Matching
share entitlement’ in the table above is based on a 25% investment. In 2016 the investment was 25% for both Executive Board members. From an
accounting perspective the corresponding matching shares vest immediately and as such a fair value of €0.9 million was recognised in the 2017
income statement. The matching share entitlements are not dividend-bearing during the five calendar year holding period of the investment
shares. Therefore, the fair value of the matching share entitlements has been adjusted for missed expected dividends by applying a discount based
on the dividend policy and vesting period.

Brewing a Better World:
our sustainability performance
Our sustainability strategy focuses on the areas
where we can make the biggest difference and
inspire our brands to align their brand purpose
with environmental and social issues.
We are making good progress and are on
track to reach the majority of our 2020
commitments, but with more to do in certain

areas, like local sourcing and taking action on
our Life Saving Rules.
We started to look beyond 2020 and define our
2030 commitments in alignment with the Paris
Agreement on climate change (COP21), the UN
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and
the expectations of our stakeholders.

The SDGs provide a powerful, common global
agenda to end poverty, protect the planet and
ensure prosperity. Climate action, access to
water, good health and sustainable production
are some of the priority areas we focus on in
our contribution.

Visit our website to find more details on our Brewing a Better
World strategy, material issues, stakeholder engagement and
performance – along with case studies from our businesses
around the world.

Water is the ultimate shared resource and
we must all safeguard it for the future.
Beer is 95% water, so it is a critical resource
for our business. We use water throughout
our supply chain – from growing crops to
our finished products. We are working hard
to reduce our water use in our breweries,
especially in water-stressed areas. We are
investing in new water treatment plants
and technology to reuse our treated water
and generate renewable energy from the
treatment process – offering good potential
for the future.

Climate change is one of the greatest threats
facing society, but still emissions continue
to rise. From production and transport
to refrigeration and waste, we focus on
reducing emissions across our entire value
chain, and we are on track to reach our 2020
targets. In our breweries, we are improving
energy efficiency – investing in efficient
processes and using more renewable energy
to brew our beer, like at Ponta Grossa in Brazil
where a new biomass boiler covers 100%
of the brewery’s thermal energy needs.
For production we have set new targets for
2030: growing our share of renewable energy
from 14% in 2017 to 70% by 2030. This would
lead to an 80% reduction in our CO2 emissions
per hl for our production (breweries).

Responsible sourcing has never been more
important. As pressure on resources grows,
we are focused on securing a long-term,
sustainable supply of raw materials,
improving farmer livelihoods and raising
supplier standards. Our sustainable sourcing
approach is based on the principles of the
Sustainable Agriculture Initiative Platform
(SAI), a multinational partnership working
towards a more sustainable food chain.

We have committed to balance the
water we consume in water-stressed areas.
The water stewardship projects that enable
us to do it are increasingly varied – from
restoring wetlands and testing whether
barley planted among olive trees in Spain
can help conserve water, to researching
innovative new irrigation techniques
with farmers in Mexico. But this is not an
easy process and takes time. One of the
challenges is mobilising stakeholders, as
everyone has a role to play.
There is more to do and our next step is
to look beyond 2020, defining our water
strategy and related targets for 2030:
‘Every Drop’.

2020 Commitment

Progress 2017

We are working hard to reduce emissions
from distribution but we still have more to
do – reducing the distance we drive, using more
sustainable fuels and vehicles, and switching
from road to rail and water. ‘Green’ fridges
have become the norm for cooling our
beverages, but our biggest impact comes
from our packaging. It is an area where we
have more to do and we are bringing it into
the scope of our target setting. In the next
two years, we will set 2030 science based
targets for reducing emissions in packaging,
distribution and cooling. These three areas
are difficult to tackle and require collaborative
action across the whole value chain.
2020 Commitment

Progress 2017

In Africa, we support farmer livelihoods,
increase processing capacity and promote
better access to markets, seeds and finance.
At the same time, HEINEKEN benefits by
reducing import-related duties and securing
a sustainable supply of raw materials.
But challenging economic conditions
impacted our ability to source locally3
in 2017.
Because many of our impacts happen
through our supply chain, we depend on our
suppliers to help us improve supply chain
standards. Ensuring compliance with the
HEINEKEN Supplier Code is just the starting
point for many suppliers as we raise our
expectations across topics such as human
and labour rights.

Beer is a natural fermented drink, that
when enjoyed in moderation can be part
of a balanced lifestyle. But there are clear
health and behavioural risks when alcohol
is not consumed responsibly. For some
people and on some occasions, it is better
not to drink at all. We are committed to
responsible consumption and use the power
of the global Heineken® brand to make
moderation cool. This year, we raised our
ambition by directing 10% of media spend
to promoting responsible drinking across all
operating companies6 selling Heineken®,
with a special eye on ‘When You Drive,
Never Drink.’

The safety of our people and those we work
with is everything and it requires constant
attention. Our goal is simple: zero fatalities
and we want ‘Safety First’ to be our number
one company behaviour. To achieve it, we
launched the 12 HEINEKEN Life Saving
Rules in 2016. They set out clear and
simple ‘do’s and ‘dont’s’ for our highest-risk
activities. These must be followed across
all our operations and our companies are
required to assess their safety performance
against these goals and invest in projects to
close any gaps.

We have an opportunity to use our
business as a positive force for change.
Helping communities prosper is good for
society, and it is also good for HEINEKEN.
Our biggest contribution is through our
core business; the jobs we create, the
businesses we support and the taxes
we pay. We believe responsible tax
behaviour is an essential element of our
sustainability strategy.

As well as being a signatory to the
Commitments to Reduce Harmful
Drinking, we are involved in partnerships
in markets around the world.
We are also an advocate for increased
consumer transparency and we aim
to provide ingredients and nutrition
information on pack or online for our
beer and cider brands by 2018, ahead of
the industry. We offer consumer choice by
providing low- and no-alcohol brands and
launched Heineken 0.0 in 2017.

2020 Commitment

But the challenges are complex. Most of
our work-related accidents and fatalities
happen outside our production sites
when people are travelling or distributing
our products. These are less controlled
environments. Our global strategy is to
systematically address safety across the
whole of the Company, with a particular
focus on road safety. Operating companies
are required to have at least one road safety
officer per 50 vehicles and, along with
defensive driving training, we are making
telematics mandatory for all company
operated vehicles.

Our social investments are based on three
building blocks:
––Direct local contributions to
community projects: from improving
safe water supply for communities
vulnerable to climate change in Vietnam,
to building shelters for women who are
survivors of domestic violence in Mexico,
––Shared value projects: creating social,
economic and environmental value,
for example through our local sourcing
projects in Africa and elsewhere,
––The HEINEKEN Africa Foundation:
investing in projects that address
maternal healthcare and water, sanitation
and hygiene, such as our partnership
to provide clean water to 3,400 people
in Burundi.
Since 1989 we have incorporated HIV/AIDS
prevention for our employees in Africa in
our medical programme, and since 2002
we provide lifelong antiretroviral medication
for HIV-positive employees and their
family members.

‘Every drop’:
protecting
water resources

Water scarcity affects more than 40% of the global population and is
projected to rise. More than 80% of wastewater resulting from human
activities is discharged into rivers or sea without any treatment, leading
to pollution1. It is vital we use water sustainably and ensure our suppliers
do the same.

Reduce water consumption in our breweries
2020 commitment
Reduce average water consumption in our breweries
to 3.5 hl/hl and in our breweries in water-stressed
areas to 3.3 hl/hl.
2018 milestone
Reduce average water consumption in our breweries
to 3.6 hl/hl.
Our progress in 2017

On track

The average water consumption in our breweries
remained on 3.6 hl/hl, meeting our 2018 milestone
and meeting our 2020 target for 58% of our total
production volume (2016: 63%).
In water-stressed areas, we decreased average
water consumption to 3.2 hl/hl. 35% of our sites
in water-stressed areas have now achieved the
3.3 hl/hl target.
At a number of sites, water consumption is still too
high. 36 sites still use above 5 hl/hl, representing 8%
of our volume.
We are investing in technology for the reclaiming
and recycling of water in our production processes,
especially in water-stressed areas. Over the coming
year, our breweries at Tangerang in Indonesia and
Meoqui in Mexico will begin to reclaim and treat
wastewater for use in non-product applications.
A similar initiative is underway at our brewery in
Singapore. We will assess the potential for installing
technology at other sites on a case-by-case basis,
depending on the situation at the brewery and the
status of the surrounding watershed.
Looking ahead
In 2018, we will define our water strategy and
related targets beyond 2020.

Water reclamation

In Indonesia, population growth,
urbanisation and industrial development
are putting water resources under
pressure. Our brewery near Jakarta
invested in technology that will enable
to reclaim treated wastewater for use in
cooling, steam and packaging.

Significant water balancing in water-stressed areas3
2020 commitment
Aim for significant water balancing by
our production units2 in water-scarce and
water-distressed areas.
2018 milestone
18 production units in water-scarce and waterdistressed areas have started to implement action
plans for water balancing.
Our progress in 2017

More to do

12 of the 23 production units in scope have begun
to implement water balancing action plans.
Six of the remaining sites have completed the
preparation phase, while three sites in Tunisia have
yet to begin and one site each in Algeria and Mexico
are at the project identification stage.
Based on a global assessment by WWF
International, we identified 13 additional sites where
we started investigating the water risks through
local assessments. Studies were completed at seven
sites in 2017 and six sites will be completed in 2018.
When water risks are confirmed, we will launch
Water Stewardship Initiatives to address them.

In Algeria, SARL Tango jointly hosted
a three-day workshop with the United
Nations Industrial Development
Organisation (UNIDO) to engage
government and industry stakeholders in
developing a shared vision of the water
issues facing the region and the action that
is needed. We are exploring opportunities
for a similar initiative in South Africa.
In Egypt, we launched a collaboration with
the University of Ghent to develop early
malting barley varieties that are more heat,
drought and disease resistant.

HEINEKEN Spain has signed an agreement

‘Drop the C’:
reducing CO2
emissions

Climate change is one of the top risks facing society4, but still greenhouse gas
emissions continue to rise. The potential impact on the lives and livelihoods
of millions of people worldwide is severe. As a global company, we must
reduce our CO2 emissions across our entire value chain – from production
and transport to packaging and cooling.

Lower emissions in production
2020 commitment
Reduce CO2 emissions from production by 40%5 to
6.4 kg CO2-eq/hl.
2018 milestone
Reduce CO2 emissions from production by 37% to
6.7 kg CO2-eq/hl.
Our progress in 2017

On track

In 2017, we achieved a 41% reduction in relative CO2
emissions from production, already surpassing our
2020 target (2016: 37%).
Our emissions are decreasing in absolute terms as
well: even though our production volumes were 57%
higher than in 2008, our emissions were 7% lower.
Wind in Mexico

29% of our electrical energy and 7% of our thermal
energy now comes from renewable sources
(2016: 25% and 5%).

HEINEKEN Mexico has signed Power
Purchase Agreements with three
windfarms, which will cover around
65% of the total electricity needed
in the coming years.

The reduction in CO2 emissions has been achieved
by improving our energy efficiency and by using
more renewables and replacing high CO2 fuels with
lower-emission fuels.
Looking ahead
We have set ambitious new targets that align
our efforts with the COP21 Paris Agreement: we
will grow our renewable energy share (thermal
and electricity combined) from 14% in 2017 to
70% in 2030. This also means that we aim for
an 80% reduction in carbon emissions per hl
compared to baseline year 2008.
We will start internal carbon shadow pricing
to help drive sustainable investment and
innovation decisions.
We joined the Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders,
an informal network of leading CEOs committed
to climate action, facilitated by the World
Economic Forum.
We will submit our commitments to the Science
Based Targets initiative.

combined (2016: 7.7%).
Emissions in Europe (including Russia) went down
0.2% from 2016 and 13.6% compared to baseline
year, putting us on track to meet our commitment
for the region. Excluding Russia, emissions decreased
by 16.1%. In Russia, a change in footprint (closure
Kaliningrad brewery) and external market factors
(including new regulations and limited low-carbon
alternatives for transport) saw emissions increase.
Bulgaria, the Netherlands and Poland have already
achieved the 2020 commitment of 20% reduction.
Emissions in Americas went down 4.1% from 2016
and 12.2% compared to baseline. USA has already

Lower emissions in packaging
Packaging materials
Packaging is essential to the identity of our brands
– it makes them unique and provides an arena for
creative innovation. It also represents the largest
part of our carbon footprint, from Barley to Bar.
In 2017, we applied a cross-functional approach
to begin reducing the carbon footprint of our
packaging without compromising the quality and
identity of our brands. It is a complex challenge: as
part of our indirect Scope 3 emissions, we started
to engage with many suppliers to develop a
deeper, shared understanding of the opportunities
to achieve large scale, meaningful reductions in
packaging emissions.

Recycling waste
Looking ahead
We will join the Aluminium Stewardship
Initiative to scale up our industry
wide collaborations.
We will continue working with expert
NGOs to formalise our 2030 vision and
identify science based targets for the
coming two years, to reduce our carbon
emissions from packaging materials.

9

In parallel, we are embedding sustainability at the
core of our packaging innovation processes.

Sourcing
sustainably

We aim to fully recycle all residual products
in our production facilities. In 2017, 97 of
our production units sent virtually zero
waste9 to landfill (2016: 91 of 165 of our
production units). This means that for
these sites waste was recycled into feed,
material loops, compost or energy. Brewer’s
grains and yeast, for example, have a high
nutrition value and are recycled for animal
or human consumption.
We will continue to roll out our Zero Waste
programme to other sites, as part of our
TPM framework.

For example, we are working closely with our
supplier, Ardagh, to reduce the impact of our
packaging in European markets.

For more information on waste recycling and how we
move towards circular business models, see our website

The Ardagh plant in Moerdijk in
the Netherlands is our largest glass
supplying plant. The installation of
sensors in the glass furnaces help to
decrease temperature fluctuations
and, as a result, reduce CO2 emissions.

With the global population on track to reach nine billion by 2050, agricultural
productivity must increase while protecting natural resources and biodiversity.
Securing a long-term supply of high quality raw materials is fundamental to our
success. To achieve our commitments, we need to support farmer livelihoods
and encourage better environmental and social standards, while increasing
processing capacity and promoting access to quality seeds and finance.

Source raw materials from sustainable sources
2020 commitment
Aim for at least 50% of our main raw materials10 to
come from sustainable sources.
2018 milestone

Looking ahead
To reach our 2020 ambition, we are applying
our sustainable agriculture programme to

Looking ahead

Our global malting partners are exploring
opportunities to invest in new processing capacity
in Africa, and are developing and testing crop
varieties that are well adapted to local conditions.

Off track

We sourced 42%13 of agricultural raw materials
used in Africa and the Middle East locally in 2017
(2016: 49%). This includes two new operating
companies consolidated since 2016: South Africa
and Ivory Coast. When we look at like-for-like
compared with the original scope, the percentage
decreased from 53% to 46%.

In Mozambique, we have begun building a
new brewery and we are running pilots with
smallholder farmers to decide which raw materials
to use.
We are working with the African Studies Centre at
Leiden University on an independent study into the
social and economic impact of our sorghum value
chain in Nigeria.

Challenging economic conditions impacted our
ability to source locally in 2017. In some operating
companies, local currency devaluations and scarcity
of hard currency (Forex) pushed up demand for local
raw materials. This, combined with below average
harvests in some countries, drove up the price of local
crops. While these price increases are good news
for many farmers, this volatility can make it difficult
for us to secure the quantity and quality of local raw
materials we require, at competitive prices.

Ethiopia

Our local sourcing project in Ethiopia
works directly with more than 20,000
farmers who produced around 80,000
tons of barley, of which an estimated
50% was sold to the brewing industry
and the rest was sold on the local
food market.

We are now sourcing locally in 13 operating
companies across 28 different value chains, including
six Public-Private Partnerships (PPP). These projects
support more than 150,000 farmer households.
We launched a new PPP in Ivory Coast which aims
to develop the local rice value chain.
We have reached an agreement with The International
Finance Corporation (IFC) to extend our barley
project in Ethiopia into new geographical areas
in 2018 and 2019, when two new malteries are

More to do

In 2017, compliance with our four-step Supplier Code
Procedure among the operating companies in scope,

We stopped working with 85 suppliers because
they were unwilling to sign our Supplier Code (47),
refused to subscribe to EcoVadis (37) or refused to
undergo a site audit (1).

Many more of our operating companies
are working with suppliers at the site audit
stage of our Supplier Code Procedure.
The threshold for compliance is high
and the required action can take many
months for a supplier to implement.
We are working to improve the support for
operating companies in delivering the audit

Growing with
communities

People around the world are now healthier, more educated and better connected
than ever before. But while we have seen poverty decline dramatically in recent
decades, millions of people still face inequalities that limit their potential27. We
contribute to the social and economic wellbeing of communities through our core
business and through our targeted support and investment in community initiatives.

Creating economic and social impact
The taxes we pay make an important contribution
to the economies and development of the
countries in which we operate. We believe
responsible tax behaviour is an essential element
of our sustainability strategy. We support stable,
transparent and predictable tax regimes that
incentivise long-term investment and economic
growth. We also support the principles that underpin
the OECD’s work on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting
(BEPS), including country-by-country reporting to
the tax authorities.

Shared value projects
Our local sourcing projects in Africa create
jobs, strengthen the agricultural sector
and improve the lives of rural households.
Between 2009 and 2017, we invested
€4.4 million in cash and €12.7 million in
equipment and people through our PPP
projects in Burundi, DRC, Ethiopia,
Ivory Coast, Nigeria, Rwanda, Sierra Leone,
South Africa. This excludes additional
third party funding leveraged by our
contribution28. Our local sourcing projects
provide work to more than 150,000
farmer households.

The HEINEKEN Africa Foundation
Since it was established in 2007, the
Foundation has committed €9.2 million to
104 projects, of which 41 projects were still
running in 2017.
In 2017, the HEINEKEN Africa Foundation
approved 10 new projects totalling an
investment of €1 million. Four of these
projects will provide access to safe drinking
water to communities in Burundi, DRC,
Kenya, and Sierra Leone, with the aim to
benefit up to 82,000 people. Other projects
will support the construction and
renovation of health centres, purchase of
mobile clinics and training of medical staff.

Values and behaviours

In ‘We are HEINEKEN’ we summarise our purpose: who we are
and what we stand for. We stand by our values: passion for quality,
enjoyment of life, respect for people and for our planet. Our values
are part of our company culture, and our Code of Business Conduct,
Supplier & Marketing Codes.
Conducting business with integrity
Our values guide how we work and conduct
our business, supporting the principles of
the UN Global Compact and the OECD
Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.
We are committed to conducting business
with fairness, integrity and respect for the
law and our values. The HEINEKEN Code of
Business Conduct and its underlying policies
communicate the basic principles that each
employee must observe when acting for, or on
behalf of, HEINEKEN. The Code and its policies
are available in more than 40 languages both
online and as a printed booklet.
Communication and training is provided to
employees worldwide to raise awareness
about the Code and its policies. A mandatory
e-learning exposes all employees to practical
business conduct dilemmas. By the end of
2017, more than 75,000 employees had
completed this training, either online or in the
classroom (2016: 50,000). We implemented
our Business Conduct framework in four new
operating companies.
As a multinational operating in more than 70
countries, we pay special attention to potential
exposure to bribery and corruption. It is our
principle never to engage in bribery, in any
place, at any time.
HEINEKEN’s anti-bribery framework consists of
several key elements aimed at our operations
to minimise the risk of and exposure to bribery
related incidents, to support our employees
with their daily challenges and to meet
applicable legal requirements. These elements
include screening of third parties and visits
to selected operations to assess their bribery
risks. Furthermore, we have an anti-bribery
e-learning programme to help our employees
recognise and deal with bribery dilemmas they
may encounter during their work.

The programme consists of three training
modules and is mandatory for key groups
of employees across a range of functions.
Module 1 and module 2 were completed
almost 19,350 times (2016: 11,187).
Module 3 was launched at the end of 2017
and completed more than 1,600 times.
We keep reasonable and proportionate
oversight on activities related to the
implementation and effectiveness of
the above through internal controls.

Speak Up
We encourage everyone to Speak Up in
confidence and without fear of retaliation
about any concerns they may have. We offer
several Speak Up channels to raise questions
and concerns, including Trusted Representatives
and an external Speak Up service (telephone
and online) which is run by an independent third
party and available 24/7, 365 days a year.
We received 661 reports of suspected
misconduct through Speak Up in 2017
(2016: 380). This increase is linked to an
internal communication campaign promoting
Speak Up, the implementation of Speak Up
in newly acquired operations and the level of
awareness and use of Speak Up at HEINEKEN
Brazil, including our newly acquired operation.
Reports related to misconduct or inappropriate
behaviour (33%), fraud (31%), discrimination
and harassment (12%), and other issues (24%).
56% of reports were substantiated and
corrective and preventative actions were taken
where relevant and possible, including process
and control improvements. Actions included
process and control improvements,
reimbursement of financial loss and
disciplinary measures.
In 2017, Transparency International
Netherlands investigated the whistleblowing
frameworks of 27 Dutch publicly listed
companies, including HEINEKEN. The report
can be downloaded on their website.

Respecting Human Rights
Our global Employees’ and Human Rights
Policy sets out 11 standards on Employee and
Human Rights including non-discrimination,
forced labour, harassment and child labour.
This policy is an integral part of our Code of
Business Conduct and builds on a foundation
of existing policies and practices to achieve our
goal of doing business with respect for Human
Rights, such as our Speak Up process, our Health
and Safety policies and programmes, the
Supplier Code process and our sustainability
programme ‘Brewing a Better World’.
In order to better understand the Human
Rights risks in our own operations and across
our value chains, we began in 2016 developing
a Human Rights Due Diligence process with
expert support from Shift, the leading centre
of expertise on the UN Guiding Principles on
Business and Human Rights. We conducted
a global gap analysis, reviewed if and how
our existing internal policies and processes
adequately manage Human Rights risks
and initiated Human Rights due diligence
workshops in Mexico, Myanmar and Nigeria.
Our salient Human Rights risks
Based on our work with Shift, we have
identified seven salient Human Rights risks for
our business in our own operations and/or our
value chains: discrimination; trade union rights;
fair wages and income; child labour in our
supply chain; working hours; access to water;
and health and safety. Most of the issues
identified are especially a risk for our operating
companies in emerging economies.
We will further test these salient risks internally
and externally, without losing sight of other
relevant Human Rights. We will also engage
relevant stakeholders for feedback and advice
on these risks.

Action plan
We have developed a Human Rights
programme, which includes the following
actions for 2018-2020:
––Building internal understanding – through
training and communication – about how
respecting Human Rights is relevant to our
business, and what it means for our daily
work. We need to bring that understanding
to many colleagues, from global functions to
our operating companies;
––Update the HEINEKEN Human Rights policy
and strengthen compliance through the
Code of Business Conduct framework;
––Leveraging our Supplier Code process to
help better manage Human Rights risks with
suppliers, and also look at ways to assess and
manage our risks beyond first tier suppliers;
––Focusing our efforts on our identified salient
Human Rights risks and on relatively high
risk operating companies with support
for risk assessment, action planning
and implementation.
At the same time we will continuously review
and assess all Human Rights related risks of our
business activities.

We will continue our risk assessment with the
expert support of Shift by organising Human
Rights workshops in 10 more markets across
all regions in 2018–2020. These workshops
will focus on practical and impactful action
planning to address identified Human
Rights risks.
Based on input from stakeholder roundtables
with NGOs and academic experts, we set up
an internal cross-functional platform gathering
HEINEKEN experts for the Africa and Middle
East Region addressing Human Rights related
issues relevant for the region. We also started
to develop operational guidance, with support
from Shift, on how to conduct business and
operate in challenging social, political, and
economic contexts.

Inclusion and diversity
As the most international brewer, it is the
diversity of our workforce that sets us apart.
Cultural diversity remains our strong point.
In 2017, we had 64 different nationalities
amongst our senior managers (2016: 53).
Female representation at senior levels grew
to 19% (2016: 17%). However, we know that
we need to do more to increase our gender
diversity. To leverage the true potential of our
diversity, we need to provide an inclusive work
environment within which every employee has
equal opportunity to contribute and develop.
This requires inclusive leaders who develop the
business, their teams and themselves.

In 2017, we rolled out a renewed guide to
Leadership Expectations and a new Inclusion
and Diversity action plan to help us better
leverage our global talent pool. We focus our
efforts on four areas:
1	Building inclusive leadership capability
to create awareness and understanding
of what being an inclusive leader means
at HEINEKEN;
2	Developing a global ambassador
community to support and engage people
in our overall inclusion and diversity agenda;
3	Developing a female mentoring
programme that supports women in their
personal development journey across
the organisation;
4	Embedding inclusion and diversity principles
throughout our people processes, including
external recruitment, promotions and
working practices.

Heineken N.V. Annual Report 2017

Reporting basis and governance of non-financial indicators
As we continue our journey of integrated reporting, this is the second year we have disclosed our financial
and Brewing a Better World performance together in one report. We believe it is important to provide
independent confirmation that the information in this report is reliable and accurate, so we have asked
Deloitte to provide limited assurance on 31 of the most important non-financial indicators29. More
information about our actions and progress in 2017, remaining non-financial KPIs, and background
information, can be found online. This includes datasheets and the GRI Standards table30.
Brewing a Better World Governance
Our governance model for Brewing a Better World ensures we deliver on our priorities both globally and locally. Brewing a Better World progress is one
of the key priority topics of the HEINEKEN Executive Team discussions, chaired by our CEO. In 2017, progress on our achievements was presented to
the Supervisory Board. Supported by expert input from subject specialists, this ensures an effective implementation of Brewing a Better World
initiatives across our business.
Focus on sustainability is embedded throughout our business, for example driven by Supply Chain (Water and CO₂), Procurement (Sustainable
Sourcing), HR (Health and Safety) and Commerce (Responsible Consumption). On a day-to-day basis, Brewing a Better World is managed by the
Global Sustainable Development team which is supported by the functions.
Around the world, each operating company has its own sustainability coordinator and a team engaged in delivering Brewing a Better World. Further,
we form alliances (tribes) throughout the organisation and with our suppliers to develop new solutions. For example, following the Paris Agreement
COP21, we will redouble our efforts to reduce emissions through our platform, which ensures it connects everyone in the company.

Operating companies in scope
The non-financial indicators in this report cover the performance of all our consolidated operating companies from 1 January 2017 up to and including
31 December 2017, unless stated otherwise. A different reporting period is applied to the accident frequency indicator (December 2016 – November
2017) as the current reporting cycle does not allow for reporting within the timelines required for the Annual Report. Newly acquired production units
are required to start reporting directly after the first calendar year following the date of acquisition.
For the first time, we included our greenfield brewery in Ivory Coast in this report. Ownership of our businesses in Belarus and Mongolia changed in
2017, which means that the key performance indicators have been included up to the sale date. We also acquired or gained a majority interest in the
following businesses during 2017: Brasil Kirin in Brazil, Tuatara craft brewery in New Zealand, Stellenbrau in South Africa, Punch Securisation A in the UK
(comprising around 1,900 pubs) and Lagunitas in the USA. These businesses will be included in the 2018 Annual Report. We opened a new brewery in
East Timor and started to build a greenfield brewery in Mozambique in December 2017, these two breweries will come into the scope of Annual Reporting
the moment it has been in operation for a full year. The term ‘production unit’ means breweries, cider plants, soft drink plants, malteries, water plants
and combinations of these, at which malt, beer, cider, soft drinks and water are produced. Two packaging material plants are also in the scope of production
units, covering the manufacture of bottles and crates. Other plants have been included too, such as a winery, distillery and ice production facilities.

Indicators in scope
The content of the report is based on the material aspects for both our Company and our stakeholders and is directly linked to the Brewing a Better
World strategy, our four focus areas and our 2020 commitments. We have selected the non-financial KPIs that are most material, based on the
following criteria:
––The KPI is a Brewing a Better World commitment
––The KPI is a new target we publicly disclosed in our 2016 report
––The KPI is not related to a target but part of one of the Brewing a Better World focus areas and seen as important by our stakeholders
––The combination of KPIs should give a balanced, high level overview of our progress in 2017.
Scope and materiality of indicators are approved on an annual basis by the Disclosure Committee, and may be adjusted once a year with effect as of
the following year.

Reporting systems
The main systems used for collection, validation and analysis of reported data:
––Safety data is reported quarterly via a global system named ARISO (Accident Reporting & Investigation Software system)
––The collection and validation of environmental data have been integrated in Business Comparison System (BCS). Production units submit
environmental data on a monthly basis in BCS
––The Green Gauge reporting system allows us to monitor and report quarterly progress against 17 key areas, related to our commitments
––Other reporting systems include the HEINEKEN Sourcing database, the Spend Analysis Tool (SAT) and the EcoVadis Platform for Supplier Code
and performance information, and Ethics Point for ‘Speak Up’ data
––The Annual Sustainability Survey is the source of information for all other data that is not covered by the previously mentioned data sources

Reporting basis and governance of non-financial indicators (continued)
Reliability and accuracy of data
We have processes governing the collection, review and validation of the non-financial data included in this reporting, at both local operating company
and global level. Subject matter experts are involved at various levels to validate and challenge the data and process.
We are continuously formulating and applying uniform definitions and instructions for reporting purposes, in order to improve the accuracy and
comparability of data. Where possible, standard calculations are built into our systems to minimise errors. Despite the continuous strengthening
of our data collection processes and the fact that our operating companies and data owners have reported to the best of their knowledge, in good
faith and in accordance with agreed procedures, it is not possible to ascertain 100% completeness of data contained in our report. Our operating
companies are at differing maturity levels with regards to implementing the various data collection processes. Where we have concerns, we highlight
them in the report.
HEINEKEN Global Audit is involved in the annual review of the non-financial indicator reporting process, including reviewing the quality of control
processes at various levels, data ownership and clarity of definitions. For 2017, Global Audit reviewed the text statements in this report.
Deloitte provides limited assurance on the selected indicators as described in detail in the Assurance report of the independent auditor.

Definitions and governance per indicator
We gather data in accordance with guidelines and definitions based on the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI Standards) Guidelines, unless stated
otherwise. Overall, we aim to align with international standards, and, if not available, we work with industry partners such as the Beverage Industry
and Environmental Roundtable (BIER) to develop common practices. For some of our responsible consumption measures, we track implementation
in accordance with industry agreements (for example, labels on our packaging).
The table below provides more information on definitions and how we manage and govern the reported indicators. Additional information can be
found in the sustainability section of the Company website and the document ‘Basis of Preparation Non-Financial Indicators’ accompanying
this report.

‘Every drop’: protecting water resources
Specific water consumption

Hectolitre water intake per hectolitre volume produced of beer, cider, soft drinks and water. Water intake minus
water exported. We make detailed action plans for reducing water use in our breweries, embedded within the Total
Productive Management (TPM) framework. Examples of actions are reducing water losses in the pasteuriser and
solving leakages. We focus our water efforts on breweries in water-stressed areas, which is the reason why we have
a separate water consumption target for these breweries

Total water withdrawal

The total volume of water withdrawn from the following sources:
––Surface water, including water from wetlands, rivers, lakes, and oceans
––Groundwater
––Rainwater collected directly and stored by the organisation
––Municipal water supplies or other water utilities

Wastewater treated

The volume of wastewater treated expressed in m3. It is our policy to ensure all of our wastewater volumes are
treated – by us or by a third party – before being discharged into surface water. Those breweries currently lacking
wastewater treatment infrastructure are part of our future investment planning

Wastewater quantity31

All wastewater coming from the brewery (m3)

Wastewater treatment plant

Plant removing contaminants from the brewery’s wastewater and producing environmentally safe treated
wastewater before releasing it into the environment.
Third party plant: an external party (most often a municipal plant) taking care of the treatment of brewery
wastewater and subsequent discharge into surface water

Effluent organic load to
surface water (kg COD)32

This indicator relates to the pollution load of the effluent that is discharged into surface water from our breweries.
This excludes the wastewater which is treated by third parties. COD stands for Chemical Oxygen Demand, which is
a measure for the pollution of water with organic material

Water stress

Refers to the ability, or lack thereof, to meet human and ecological demand for water. Compared to scarcity, ‘water stress’
is a more inclusive and broader concept. It considers several physical aspects related to water resources, including water
scarcity, but also water quality, environmental flows, and the accessibility of water. Every five years, we assess current and
future risks arising from the watersheds in which our breweries are located. In 2015 we undertook a water risk assessment
with WWF International across our total operational footprint – fully consolidated as well as Joint Ventures – and on our
barley-sourcing areas. Production sites identified as potentially located in a water-stressed area need to complete a Source
Vulnerability Assessment (SVA). This enables us to obtain a clear picture of the local water situation, identify relevant
stakeholders and explore the need for activities that increase water retention or promote the health of ecosystems. The
outcomes serve as a basis for local Source Water Protection Plans, which includes the plans for water balancing. The
outcome of the assessment can also indicate that water risks are negligible and that no further actions are required

This specific indicator will be disclosed by end of March 2018 in the sustainability section of the Company website.
HEINEKEN Energy Efficiency Index is the energy consumption of the fridge divided by the average energy consumption of similar HEINEKEN fridges on the market in 2010, multiplied by 100.

Water balancing

Redressing the balance in water-stressed areas between the amount of water we source from the watershed and
the amount that is not returned because it is used in our products, and through evaporation. One of the challenges
is mobilising stakeholders, particularly at a government level. To help us, in February 2015, we entered into a
partnership with the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO). HEINEKEN and UNIDO are
jointly organising three-day stakeholder engagement workshops to develop a shared vision on the most important
water issues and on collective efforts needed to redress them in priority locations

Water balancing projects

Projects that aim to conserve or restore water quantity or quality in the local watershed; and/or improve access
to clean water for the local communities. We consider a balancing project started once a Memorandum of
Understanding has been signed with one or more partners. This is a change of definition compared to 2016, where
we considered a project already started once a feasibility study was finalised. Since a study is not always followed
by a concrete project, we think the new definition is more robust. This is the reason why the number of breweries
compliant to this definition went down in 2017 from 13 to 12

‘Drop the C’: reducing CO2 emissions
% of electrical
energy coming from
renewable sources

Quantity of renewable electrical energy use (kWh) divided by total electrical energy use (kWh). Sources can be:
––Own renewable production = all electricity generated from renewable resources on-site (wind, solar, biogas)
–– Imported electricity under green certificates = all electricity streams for which certified green electricity is purchased

% of thermal energy coming
from renewable sources

Quantity of renewable thermal energy use (MJ) divided by total thermal energy use (MJ). Sources are: biomass,
biogas, solar thermal and imported heat (with 100% renewable % and 0 g CO2/MJ)

CO2 emissions in
production (Scope 1
and 2, GHG Protocol)

This indicator includes CO2-eq emissions caused by:
––direct emissions from combustion of fuels
––indirect emissions from imported heat and electricity
––emissions from refrigerant losses
The reduction in CO2 emissions is being achieved by improving our energy efficiency for both thermal and electrical
energy (as part of our TPM framework), and by using more renewables and replacing high CO2 fuels such as fuel oil
with lower-emission fuels such as natural gas

CO2 emissions in distribution
(Scope 3, GHG protocol)

This indicator refers to CO2-eq emissions from outbound distribution of finished goods and returns of empty
packaging material. It includes domestic and export transport by road, rail and sea. Excluded is inbound transport.
We focus our actions on reducing the distance we drive, improving fuel efficiency with our transport partners,
switching from road to rail and water, and using more carbon-efficient vehicles. As the majority of our transport is
outsourced, we work in collaboration with our transport service providers and also with peer companies, customers,
fuel providers, industry groups and other key stakeholders

CO2 emissions from fridges
(Scope 3, GHG protocol)

This indicator refers to CO2-eq emissions as a result of the electricity used by beverage fridges (branded and
non-branded) invoiced to HEINEKEN in the reporting year

Green fridges

HEINEKEN buys and supplies fridges used to store and display our beer products in supermarkets, bars and restaurants.
This allows us to control the quality of the beer by setting the correct temperature, as well as the appearance of
the fridge and our brands within it. To reduce our emissions, we focus on installing more energy-efficient fridges in
conjunction with our suppliers. We ask our suppliers to test new fridges to determine the HEINEKEN Energy Efficiency
Index (HEEI)28. In case our suppliers have not (yet) provided us with the HEEI, we calculate the HEEI based on the energy
saving features of the fridge model. We judge our fridges as ‘green’ if they have one or more of the following green
features: use of hydrocarbon refrigerant, LED illumination, an energy management system and energy-efficient fans.
We further enhanced our data gathering method, and decreased our reliance on self-declared numbers by the
operating companies to using our centralised procurement tool where possible

Waste destination per %
and absolute value33

Destination of residual products from the brewing process: either recycled into feed, material loops, compost or
energy, or – when not recycled – incinerated or sent to landfill. Brewer’s grains and yeast, for example, have a high
nutrition value and are recycled for animal or human consumption.
It is our ambition to achieve zero waste to landfill in our production facilities, and this is part of our mandatory
TPM framework

This specific indicator will be disclosed by end of March 2018 in the sustainability section of the Company website.

Sourcing sustainably
Sustainable agriculture

By sourcing raw materials sustainably, we help improve farming practices and enable farmers all over the world
to adopt better environmental and social standards. Our procedures for sourcing sustainably cultivated crops are
based on the principles of the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative Platform (SAI), an organisation of multinational food
companies working towards a more sustainable food chain. Suppliers allocating sustainably cultivated crops to us are
required to follow our procedures and we encourage them to work with farmers who grow their crops sustainably.
We follow the definition of the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative (SAI): The efficient production of safe, high quality
agricultural products, in a way that protects and improves the natural environment, the social and economic conditions
of farmers, their employees and local communities, and safeguards the health and welfare of all farmed species.
Our sustainable sourcing reporting is based on the concept of ‘mass balance’. This tracks what percentage of a
suppliers’ materials are produced sustainably and is fully auditable, from farm to brewery

% of our main agricultural
raw materials from
sustainable sources

Contracted sustainable volumes (tonnes)/Total contracted volumes (tonnes).
Sustainable volume = any agricultural product in scope of the Sustainable Agriculture programme, that has been:
1. cultivated in accordance with an approved Code of Practice and
2. allocated to HEINEKEN by our supplier in accordance with the mass balance approach
Volumes contracted in 2017 for delivery in 2018 are reported in the 2017 Annual Report

% of agricultural raw
materials locally sourced
in Africa

Quantity (in tons) of agricultural ‘extract’ producing raw materials (plus hops) that are cultivated in the Africa and
Middle East region and that are purchased for use in the production of beers, soft drinks, cider, wine and spirits at
our own production facilities in that region

Estimated number of
smallholder farms involved

Calculation based on the total quantity of agricultural raw materials purchased (tons), divided by the average farm
size (hectares) and the average yield per crop produced (tons per hectare). This gives the estimated number of
smallholder farms involved

Number of different local
sourcing initiatives

HEINEKEN operating companies sourcing any agricultural raw material within the AME Region. Each value chain
is counted individually and some involve working with smallholder farmers, while others work with larger scale
commercial farmers.
As a large buyer of crops, we can have a significant economic impact on local agricultural communities. Our local sourcing
PPP projects work with smallholder farmers and aim to help them raise yields and compete against imported crops. They
empower farmers and their communities by helping to alleviate poverty and improve local food security. At the same
time, HEINEKEN benefits by reducing import-related duties and securing a sustainable supply of raw materials.
To achieve more, faster, we support a number of Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) in which HEINEKEN and a
public sector donor (e.g. the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the German GIZ development agency) jointly
fund agricultural development projects. Other partners include the European Cooperative for Rural Development
(EUCORD), International Finance Corporation (IFC), International Fertilizer Development Center (IFDC), and Dutch
NGOs ICCO and FairMatch Support

HEINEKEN Supplier Code

Much of our impact lies indirectly with our suppliers, so we work with them to embed the right practices. Every supplier
is asked to abide by our Supplier Code, which sets out clear guidelines for how we expect them to act in the areas of
Integrity and Business Conduct, Human Rights, and the Environment. The Supplier Code procedure is implemented
among first tier suppliers, and we expect our suppliers to ensure that their suppliers adhere to the same standards

Supplier

A supplier is an entity:
––that delivers goods and/or services on a regular basis, more than once a calendar year, and
––is registered in the vendor master database as an active supplier, and of which invoices are registered in the
central systems for payment on behalf of Heineken N.V. or one of its affiliates, and
––with which there has been spend in the 18 months preceding the assessment of the status of the supplier
The definition excludes: tax authorities, charities, sponsorships, customer refunds and intercompany suppliers

Supplier Code
four-step procedure

We safeguard compliance through a risk-based step-by-step process:
1. By signing the HEINEKEN Supplier Code, suppliers agree to comply with our principles of integrity, environmental
care and human rights.
2. T
 he intensity with which we monitor compliance against our Supplier Code depends on the risk profile of
a supplier. Our supplier risk analysis (SRA) tool assesses suppliers based on their type of business and level of
supplier-specific risk. All potentially high-risk suppliers are required to go through step three of the programme.
3. W
 e use the EcoVadis34 sustainability monitoring and scorecard to assess the strength of potentially highrisk suppliers’ management systems for ensuring compliance with our Code. Suppliers complete an online
questionnaire and provide supporting evidence, which EcoVadis analyses alongside a 360° scan which looks at
whether a supplier has been mentioned positively or negatively in the media, by NGOs or trade unions. They then
create a supplier scorecard. Suppliers that are still considered high-risk go on to Step 4 and undergo a site audit.
4. The final step is a site audit by a third party using our Supplier Code as the basic assessment criteria. We use the SMETA35
four-pillar protocol. It enables us to contribute to and use the global database of audits held by AIM-Progress, the
responsible-sourcing platform used by over 40 of the world’s leading fast-moving consumer goods companies.
We strive for continuous improvement to ensure ongoing compliance with our Supplier Code. If a case of non-compliance
is found, we discuss corrective actions with the supplier and allow for commitment to correct the non-compliance within
a given timeline. If commitment and action is not forthcoming, HEINEKEN will cease to do business with the supplier

EcoVadis is a sustainability rating and collaborative platform enabling companies to monitor the sustainability performance of their suppliers, across 150 sectors and 110 countries. The evaluation covers 21 Corporate
Social Responsibility (CSR) criteria and is used today by 120 global multinationals. EcoVadis engages approximately 20,000 suppliers a year whereby 70% of suppliers are SMEs (less than 1000 employees).
SMETA (Sedex Members Ethical Trade Audit) describes an audit procedure which is a compilation of good practice in ethical audit technique.

This KPI measures the overall performance over the four steps of our Supplier Code Procedure, per operating
company. Depending on the availability of the data, we calculate the operating company’s overall performance
based on the average performance over the four steps or based on the percentage of suppliers compliant with all
applicable steps. The reported % compliance reflects the simple average of all operating companies in scope

All expenses incurred for placing and broadcasting Heineken® brand dedicated responsible consumption campaigns
(either supporting ‘Enjoy Heineken® Responsibly’ or ‘When You Drive, Never Drink’) amounting to a minimum of 10%
of their actual Heineken® media spend, per market. Scope: In 2017, we raised our ambition, going from 14 markets in

aimed at addressing
alcohol-related harm

Working closely with third parties like local governments, NGOs and specialists, these partnerships address
alcohol-related harm on issues like underage drinking, drinking and driving, or excessive drinking. In scope are all
HEINEKEN operating companies with the exemption of those in Islamic countries, export markets, markets where
we have a Joint Venture and one minimal-volume market (Laos) where allocating resource is unrealistic. South Africa
is included as of 2017. Compared to last year’s report, we have simplified and clarified definition and guidance of this
commitment for our operating companies. Active partnerships means: meaningful, substantive engagement over a
year or years, with each side benefiting and being challenged by the other. An active partnership should have a regular
cadence of communication and a regular schedule for collaborations or joint executions. A relevant alcohol partnership
is one that is responsive to the needs of the local community as identified by critical stakeholders and/or local trends

Beer, Wine and Spirits
Producers’ Commitments to
Reduce Harmful Drinking

HEINEKEN is a signatory to the Producers’ Commitments to Reduce Harmful Drinking. This is managed by the
International Alliance for Responsible Drinking (IARD). The aim of the Producers’ commitments, which run from
2013–2017, is to contribute as an industry to the global target set by the World Health Organization (WHO) of “at least
a 10% relative reduction in the harmful use of alcohol” by 2025. We take action in five key areas: under-age drinking,
marketing codes of practice, consumer information and product innovation, drinking and driving, and retailer support

Responsible Marketing Code

In 2015, we launched our renewed Responsible Marketing Code. This Code, which is fully in line with the Producers’
commitments, guides us in the way we market our products. These rules help everyone at HEINEKEN who is
involved in marketing and the sales of our products to ensure we do not contribute to excessive consumption or
misuse. The Code covers all communications channels, the most common being: packaging, point of sale, signage,
trade promotions, sponsorships, advertising, digital and social media

Promoting health & safety
% of Life Saving Rules action

Our ‘Safety First’ approach is focused on improving safety across the whole company. Our global strategy is
systematically addressing safety across the whole of the Company, with a particular focus on road safety. The 12
Life Saving Rules set out clear and simple ‘do’s and don’ts’ for our highest-risk activities. All operating companies are
required to assess their safety performance and close any gaps through action plans. In 2016 an operating company
was compliant when an action plan was in place. In 2017 compliance is based on the number of actions implemented

Fatal accidents

All work-related fatal accidents of permanent, fixed-term or temporary personnel (own staff and contractor personnel)

Accidents

Growing with communities
Our approach to tax

In support of HEINEKEN’s business priorities we pursue a tax strategy that is sustainable and transparent. This
strategy is annually reviewed and approved both by the Executive Board and the Audit Committee.
Our tax strategy is based on a number of key principles:
––Our commitment to comply with relevant tax laws and international regulations goes beyond legal compliance:
• Our way of working conforms with the HEINEKEN Code of Conduct;
• We expect to pay tax on our activities in the country where they take place; and
• We do not use tax havens for tax avoidance purposes.
––We pursue an open and constructive dialogue with tax authorities that is based on respect, transparency
and trust. We have developed co-operative compliance relationships with tax authorities in several countries
including, amongst others, the Netherlands and in the United Kingdom.
––We fully support and follow the OECD transfer pricing guidelines. Transactions between HEINEKEN companies
are conducted at ‘arm’s length’.

Total Tax Contribution
per category

The tax payments made by the fully consolidated HEINEKEN companies during the calendar year. The total
tax contribution includes a limited degree of estimation. The scope of total tax contribution is limited to the
consolidated reporting entities (not JVs and associates). The categories are: corporate income tax paid, excise
duties paid, net VAT paid, employee taxes paid (incl. social security contributions, but excluding pension
contributions), other taxes paid

Corporate income tax paid

Cash flows arising from taxes on income, reported by the fully consolidated Heineken companies

Effective income
tax rate (beia)

Income tax expense expressed as a percentage of the profit before income tax, adjusted for share of profit of
associates and joint ventures and impairments thereof (net of income tax)

Beia

Total direct contributions

Voluntary contributions (in cash, knowledge, employee time, products and equipment) that help local communities
and broader societies address their development priorities and increase the quality of life. The operating
companies are free to establish which issues are relevant to both the community and the business. We provide
guidelines how to prioritise projects within the focus areas of Brewing a Better World, for example on water
stewardship and addressing alcohol related harm. In certain markets, community investments are coordinated
through local foundations, like in Spain and Singapore.
We encourage our employees to volunteer their time with local community organisations. Volunteerism enables
employees to give their time and professional expertise to organisations in need of human resources, and it makes
Brewing a Better World personal, relevant and a source of pride and ownership for our employees

HEINEKEN Africa
Foundation

Donations as a voluntary engagement in collaboration with (non) governmental charitable organisations that
extends beyond our core business activities, to help improve the health of the communities where we do business.
The HEINEKEN Africa Foundation supports projects that improve health for the people who need it most. Over
the years, the Foundation has developed strong expertise in Mother & Child Care and Water, Sanitation and
Hygiene (WASH). The Foundation works closely together with the HEINEKEN breweries in Sub-Saharan Africa
and (N)GOs. Underpinning HEINEKEN’s longstanding commitment to Africa, projects are only carried out in the
Sub-Saharan African countries in which HEINEKEN is operating. For each project a partnership is created between
the HEINEKEN Africa Foundation, the local HEINEKEN brewery and a local or international (N)GO. The Foundation
provides funding and administrative assistance. The local brewery supports through means of manpower,
expertise and monitoring. The (N)GO is responsible for the implementation and continuation of the project.

Values and behaviours
Speak Up policy (number
of reports + breakdown)

The number of Speak Up reports is the total number of reports received via our Speak Up channels in which
reporters raised a concern about a (possible) breach of the HEINEKEN Code of Business Conduct. A break-down
per topic is presented to give insight into the main topics of said Speak Up reports. The Speak Up policy is available
at the HEINEKEN Speak Up website (http://speakup.heineken.com)

Training Code of Business
Conduct (number
of employees)

The Code of Business Conduct training has to be completed by all HEINEKEN employees. It is expected to be
completed as part of the induction for new joiners. Thereafter it is expected to be completed regularly (preferably
on an annual basis). The training is facilitated by an e-learning module, which can be completed online, as well as
during a classroom session for those employees without access to their own workstation. A training completion is
counted if (i) an employee has completed the e-learning (this is automatically registered in a database), or (ii) if an
employee has attended a classroom training and signed off an attendance form

Training anti-bribery
(number of employees)

In 2015, we launched a three-year anti-bribery e-learning programme for key employees to ensure that they recognise
and resist bribery. The anti-bribery training is mandatory for a selected audience (those above a certain job grade and
those considered to be risk groups). A training completion is counted if an employee has completed the e-learning

Heineken N.V. Annual Report 2017

Independent Auditor’s Report
To: The Annual General Meeting of Heineken N.V.

Report on the audit of the financial statements 2017 included in the Annual Report 2017
Our opinion
We have audited the accompanying financial statements 2017 of Heineken N.V. (‘the Company’), based in Amsterdam. The financial statements
include the consolidated financial statements and the Company financial statements.
In our opinion:
––The accompanying consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of Heineken N.V. as at 31 December 2017
and of its result and its cash flows for 2017 in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union
(‘EU-IFRS’) and with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.
––The accompanying Company financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of Heineken N.V. as at 31 December 2017 and
of its result for the year 2017 in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.
The consolidated financial statements comprise:
––The consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2017.
––The following consolidated statements for 2017: the income statement, the statement of comprehensive income, the statement of cash flows and
the statement of changes in equity.
––The notes comprising a summary of the significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
The Company financial statements comprise:
––The Company balance sheet as at 31 December 2017.
––The Company income statement for 2017.
––The notes comprising a summary of the significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.

Basis for our opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Dutch law, including the Dutch Standards on Auditing. Our responsibilities under those standards are
further described in the section “Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements” of our report.
We are independent of Heineken N.V. in accordance with the EU Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest
entities, the Wet toezicht accountantsorganisaties (Wta, Audit firms supervision act), the Verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij
assurance-opdrachten (ViO, Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to independence) and other relevant independence
regulations in the Netherlands. Furthermore we have complied with the Verordening gedrags- en beroepsregels accountants (VGBA, Dutch Code
of Ethics).
We believe the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Materiality
Based on our professional judgement we determined the materiality for the financial statements as a whole at €150 million. The materiality is based
on consolidated profit before taxation (5.2%). We have also taken into account misstatements and/or possible misstatements that in our opinion are
material for the users of the financial statements for qualitative reasons.
Audits of Group entities (components) were performed using materiality levels determined by the judgement of the Group audit team, having regard
to the materiality of the consolidated financial statements as a whole. Component materiality did not exceed €60 million and for the majority of the
components, materiality is significantly less than this amount.
We agreed with the Supervisory Board that misstatements in excess of €7.5 million, which are identified during the audit, would be reported to them,
as well as smaller misstatements that, in our view, must be reported on qualitative grounds.

Scope of the Group audit
Heineken N.V. is at the head of a group of entities. The financial information of this group is included in the consolidated financial statements of
Heineken N.V.
Because we are ultimately responsible for the opinion, we are also responsible for directing, supervising and performing the Group audit. In this respect
we have determined the nature and extent of the audit procedures to be carried out for the Group entities (components). Decisive were size and/or risk
profile of the components. On this basis, we selected components for which an audit or review had to be carried out on the complete set of financial
information or specific items.

Heineken N.V. Annual Report 2017

Independent Auditor’s Report (continued)
Our Group audit mainly concentrated on significant components in terms of size and financial interest or where significant risks or complex activities
were present, leading to full scope audits performed for 25 components.
We have performed audit procedures ourselves at corporate entities and the operations in the Netherlands. Furthermore, we performed audit
procedures at Group level on areas such as consolidation, disclosures, goodwill, intangible assets, joint ventures, financial instruments, acquisitions and
divestments. Specialists were involved amongst others in the areas of treasury, information technology, tax, accounting, pensions and valuation.
For selected component audit teams, the Group audit team provided detailed written instructions, which, in addition to communicating the
requirements of component audit teams, detailed significant audit areas and information obtained centrally relevant to the audit of individual
components including awareness for risk related to management override. Furthermore, we developed a plan for overseeing each component audit
team based on its relative significance to the Company and certain other risk characteristics. This included procedures such as visiting components
(Mexico, D.R.Congo, Brazil, Cambodia, Singapore, Belgium, Poland, United Kingdom, Spain, Nigeria, South Africa, Ireland and Ivory Coast) during the
year, performing file reviews, holding conference calls, attending meetings and reviewing component audit team deliverables to gain sufficient
understanding of the work performed. For smaller components we have performed review procedures or specific audit procedures.
By performing the procedures mentioned above we have been able to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence on the Group’s financial
information to provide an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.

Our key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements. We have
communicated the key audit matters to the Supervisory Board. The key audit matters are not a comprehensive reflection of all matters discussed.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon and we do not
provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Acquisition accounting: identification and valuation of intangible assets and valuation of liabilities
Risk

As set out in note 6, the Company concluded acquisitions throughout the year most notably the acquisition of Brasil Kirin
on 31 May and Punch Taverns on 29 August 2017. Accounting for these acquisitions in accordance with IFRS 3 requires
management to apply estimates to determine the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities, and any
resulting goodwill,
The valuation of intangible assets of €399 million and the valuation of property, plant and equipment of €1.948 million
arising from the acquisitions were considered to be a key risk as the valuation is based on a number of assumptions such
as discount rate and growth rate which are subject to significant judgement.
We further considered there to be a risk in determining the fair value of acquired provisions and contingent liabilities
within the Kirin acquisition of €1.761 million due to the estimates required in valuing liabilities of inherently uncertain
outcome, such as the outcome of civil, labour and tax claims against the acquired company.

How the scope of our
audit responded to
the risk

We have obtained management’s calculations for the accounting of the acquisition and evaluated management’s
determination of the fair value of the net assets acquired, focusing on the valuation of intangible assets, property,
plant and equipment and provisions recognised. We evaluated the fair value of the acquired assets, focusing on
the valuation methodologies and key assumptions applied. We further challenged management’s methodology
and assumptions underlying the valuation of provisions and contingent liabilities assumed. We evaluated the
competence of specialists involved by management and involved internal valuation and real estate specialists to
assist in our assessment of the fair value of the noncurrent assets acquired. We considered whether adjustments to
the original valuations were appropriate in light of additional facts and circumstances that have become available in
the measurement period to date. Further, we have evaluated the appropriateness of the related disclosures in note 6
of the financial statements.

Revenue recognition – Accruals for promotional allowances and volume rebates
Risk

Auditing standards require a presumed risk related to revenue recognition. Accounting for promotional allowances and
volume rebates impacts the amounts of revenue recognised during the period. The revenue accounting policies are
specified in note 3 to the financial statements. Management estimates the values of promotional allowances and volume
rebates and this estimate is considered to be a key audit matter relevant to our audit of the financial statements.

How the scope of our
audit responded to
the risk

Our audit procedures included, amongst others, evaluating controls relating to management’s process for determining
the value of promotional allowances and the volume rebates. In addition we performed substantive testing and
analytical procedures to test the accuracy and completeness of the underlying calculation of the accruals.
These procedures included challenging the appropriateness of management’s assumptions and estimates and agreeing
input data, including pricing and allowance data to underlying agreements with customers.

Heineken N.V. Annual Report 2017

Independent Auditor’s Report (continued)
Intangible assets (including goodwill) and property, plant and equipment impairment test – Management assessment of recoverability
Risk

Intangible assets (including goodwill) and property, plant and equipment represent 70% of the Statement of Financial
Position. Procedures over management’s annual impairment test were significant to our audit because the assessment
process is complex and the test relies on estimates and assumptions.

How the scope of our
audit responded to
the risk

Intangibles and property, plant and equipment are allocated to Cash Generating Units (CGUs) and groups of CGUs.
The Company uses assumptions in respect of future market and economic conditions such as economic growth,
expected inflation rates, demographic developments, expected market share, revenue and margin development.
The details on the accounting for intangibles and property, plant and equipment and disclosure requirements under IAS
36 Impairment of assets are included in notes 3, 14 and 15 to the financial statements. For our audit we assessed and
tested the assumptions, the discount rates, methodologies and data used by the Company, for example by comparing
them to external data such as expected inflation rates, external market growth expectations and by analysing
sensitivities in the Company’s valuation model. We included valuation specialists in our team to assist us. We specifically
focused on the sensitivity in the available headroom of CGUs and whether a reasonably possible change in assumptions
could cause the carrying amount to exceed its recoverable amount. We also assessed the historical accuracy of
management’s estimates. We assessed the adequacy of the Company’s disclosure notes 14 and 15 in the financial
statements about those assumptions to which the outcome of the impairment test is most sensitive.

Taxes – provisions for uncertain tax positions and valuation of deferred tax assets
Risk

The Company operates across a number of different tax jurisdictions and is subject to periodic challenges by local tax
authorities during the normal course of business, including transaction-related taxes and transfer pricing arrangements.
In those cases where the amount of tax payable or recoverable is uncertain, the Company establishes provisions based
on its judgement of the probable amount of the liability or recovery. Deferred tax assets for tax losses carried forward are
recognised by the Company to the extent that it is probable that future taxable income will be available against which
unused tax losses can be utilised. The income tax related accounting policies are specified in note 3 to the
financial statements.

How the scope of our
audit responded to
the risk

We focused on these areas because of the level of judgement that is applied in quantifying appropriate provisions for
uncertain tax positions and in determining assumptions about future market and economic conditions, as it relates to
the recoverability of deferred tax assets. Using our own tax specialists, we obtained a detailed understanding of the
Company’s tax strategy including current transfer pricing arrangements. We assessed tax risks, legislative developments
and the status of ongoing local tax authority audits. We evaluated and challenged the Company’s judgements in
respect of estimates of tax exposures, recoverable amounts and contingencies. We considered correspondence with tax
authorities and relevant historical and recent judgements, and also assessed legal opinions from third party tax advisors.
With regard to recorded deferred tax assets, we evaluated the Company’s assumptions and estimates in relation to the
likelihood of generating sufficient future taxable income based on budgets and business plans.
Finally we considered the adequacy of the Company’s disclosures in notes 13, 18, 24 and 32 regarding uncertain tax
positions and recognised deferred tax assets.

Internal controls over financial reporting
Risk

The Company operates various processes and procedures that are important for reliable financial reporting.
These processes are operated both centrally as well as locally.
We identified the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting as an area of focus as we consider internal controls
over financial reporting as a basis for designing our procedures for the audit. In those instances where accounting
procedures, associated IT and process level controls are not designed and/or operating effectively, there are risks
associated with financial reporting to which we need to tailor our audit procedures.

How the scope of our
audit responded to
the risk

We have performed audit procedures on both the centrally and locally established process level controls of the Company,
including the diverse information technology landscape. We performed walkthroughs to gain an understanding of the
entity and to identify relevant controls. We have tested the design of those controls and, where effective for the audit,
we also tested their operating effectiveness. In cases of deficiencies, we have evaluated the compensating controls and
measures of the Company and/or tailored procedures our procedures to address the risk.
We are however not required nor engaged to perform an audit of internal controls over financial reporting. Accordingly,
we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting.

Heineken N.V. Annual Report 2017

Independent Auditor’s Report (continued)
Report on the other information included in the Annual Report
In addition to the financial statements and our Independent auditor’s report, the Annual Report contains other information that consists of:
––Report of the Executive Board;
––Report of the Supervisory Board;
––Other Information pursuant to Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code; and
––Other information included in the Annual Report.
Based on the following procedures performed, we conclude that the other information:
––is consistent with the financial statements and does not contain material misstatements; and
––contains the information as required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.
We have read the other information. Based on our knowledge and understanding obtained through our audit of the financial statements or otherwise,
we have considered whether the other information contains material misstatements.
By performing these procedures, we comply with the requirements of Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code and the Dutch Standard 720. The scope
of the procedures performed is less than the scope of those performed in our audit of the financial statements.
Management is responsible for the preparation of other information, including the Report of the Executive Board in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2
of the Dutch Civil Code and other information pursuant to Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.

Report on other legal and regulatory requirements
Engagement
We were appointed by the Annual General Meeting as auditor of Heineken N.V. on 24 April 2014. The audit for year 2017 was our third year audit.

No prohibited non-audit services
We have not provided prohibited non-audit services as referred to in Article 5(1) of the EU Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory
audit of public-interest entities.

Description of responsibilities regarding the financial statements
Responsibilities of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board for the Financial Statements
The Executive Board is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with EU-IFRS and Part 9 of Book
2 of the Dutch Civil Code, and for the preparation of the Report of the Executive Board in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.
Furthermore, the Executive Board is responsible for such internal control as the Executive Board determines is necessary to enable the preparation of
the financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
As part of the preparation of the financial statements, the Executive Board is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going
concern. Based on the financial reporting frameworks mentioned, the Executive Board should prepare the financial statements using the going
concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to
do so. The Executive Board should disclose events and circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going
concern in the financial statements.
The Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.

Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objective is to plan and perform the audit assignment in a manner that allows us to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence for our opinion.
Our audit has been performed with a high, but not absolute, level of assurance, which means we may not have detected all errors and fraud during
our audit.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to
influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. The materiality affects the nature, timing and extent of our
audit procedures and the evaluation of the effect of identified misstatements on our opinion.
For an overview of our responsibilities we refer to NBA’s website www.nba.nl (Standard texts auditor’s report).

Heineken N.V. Annual Report 2017

Assurance Report of the Independent Auditor (continued)
Basis for our conclusion
We have performed our assurance engagement on the sustainability data in accordance with Dutch law, including Dutch Standard 3000A ‘Assurance
engagements other than audits or reviews of historical financial information’. This assurance engagement is aimed at obtaining limited assurance.
Our responsibilities under this standard are further described in the ‘Our responsibilities for the assurance engagement of the sustainability data’
section of our report.
We are independent of the Company in accordance with the ‘Verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assuranceopdrachten’
(ViO) and other relevant independence requirements in The Netherlands. Furthermore we have complied with the ‘Verordening gedrags- en
beroepsregels accountants’ (VGBA).
We believe that the assurance evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion.

Responsibilities of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board
The Executive Board of the Company is responsible for the preparation of the sustainability data in accordance with the internally applied Reporting
Criteria, including the identification of the intended users and the criteria being applicable for the purposes of the intended users.
The Executive Board is also responsible for such internal control as it determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the sustainability data that is
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or errors.
The Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the Company’s reporting process.

Our responsibilities for the assurance engagement of the sustainability data
Our responsibility is to plan and perform the assurance assignment in a manner that allows us to obtain sufficient and appropriate review evidence for
our conclusion.
We apply the ‘Nadere voorschriften accountantskantoren ter zake van assurance opdrachten (RA/AA)’ and accordingly maintain a comprehensive
system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and
applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or errors and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to
influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the sustainability data. The materiality affects the nature, timing and extent of our
review procedures and the evaluation of the effect of identified misstatements on our conclusion.
This assurance engagement is aimed at obtaining limited assurance. The procedures performed in order to obtain a limited level of assurance are
aimed at determining the plausibility of information and are less extensive than those aimed at obtaining reasonable assurance in an
assurance engagement.
The performed procedures in this context consisted mainly of gathering information from officers of the Company and applying analytical procedures
set out in relation to the sustainability data.
The assurance obtained in assurance engagements aimed at obtaining limited assurance is therefore significantly lower than the assurance obtained
in assurance engagements aimed at obtaining reasonable assurance.
We have exercised professional judgement and have maintained professional scepticism throughout the assurance engagement, in accordance with
the Dutch Standard 3000A.
Our assurance engagement included amongst others:
––gaining knowledge and obtaining an understanding of the sustainability data and other circumstances regarding the engagement including
gaining knowledge regarding internal controls;
––an analytical review of the data and trends submitted;
––assessing the suitability of the Reporting Criteria.
