Ton Hillen
Chairman of the Executive
Board of Heijmans N.V.

The year 2017 was a transitional year for Heijmans, in which
we worked on an amended profile with a clear direction, a
tightened focus and the implementation of strategic choices.
This transition actually began in the fourth quarter of 2016,
when we opted to make safeguarding continuity, de-risking
projects, debt reduction and the recovery of profitability our
top priorities. In close consultation with our banks and
financiers, Heijmans managed to both safeguard the
company’s business continuity and work on the recovery of
the company within the agreed financial parameters.
At the same time, we accelerated the implementation of our strategy, which
targets ‘Focus, Discipline and Excellence’, and continued to refine this strategy.
This resulted in adjustments to the management of the organisation, the sale
of subsidiaries, a more selective acquisition policy and reassessment of our
tender and project portfolio. We gradually brought a number of projects with a
considerable negative impact on the results under control and this has helped
to strongly reduce our risk profile. By the spring of 2017, we had already sold
our foreign businesses and we could justifiably refer to Heijmans as a purely
Dutch company. At the same time, the housing market continued to recover.
Especially in the four big cities and their surrounding areas, we saw a marked
pick-up in the growth of the housing market, which eventually also resulted in
new perspectives for the commercial market. At Infra, partly as a result of the
market vision and the adjustment of our own focus, we have managed to
improve the balance between large projects and regional projects.

Working on a stronger organisation
The drastic internal changes and the rapid turnaround in the market put
considerable strain on our organisation. With more than 4,500 employees,
Heijmans proved itself capable of adapting to these internal and external
developments under immense pressure. There is a great awareness within the
company that everyone can contribute and that we must ‘do what we can’. Our
cultural values programme ‘IK’, which is based on ownership, result-orientation
and cooperation, emphasises this awareness and translates this into our
employees’ day-to-day work. The aim of this programme is to make every
employee fully aware of these values and encourage them to discuss attitudes
and conduct with each other. The basic premise is always that we are all
responsible for creating a safe working environment for our employees and
partners. We are therefore deeply saddened to have to report a fatal accident at
a project in progress in the year under review.

PROFILE & STRATEGY

REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD

CORPORATE GOVERANCE

Driven in part by the pressure to make the necessary
transition, we launched the GRIP programme. This
programme uses tight process controls to increase the
predictability of projects, resulting in ‘no surprises’. With a
view to improving the company’s own risk management
and the risk management of projects, Heijmans appointed
a Chief Risk Officer at Infra in 2017. The position of risk
officer is now being introduced at group level, which
means we can develop risk management from a company-wide and integrated perspective.

Market developments and strategic choices
In terms of market developments, the growth in the
housing market offers considerable opportunities. For
Heijmans, it is vital to make use of the growth in a sound
and controlled manner. This means that cooperating with
chain partners and making clear choices in the acquisition of new projects are important. The number of
households in the Netherlands will continue to grow in
the years ahead, with the emphasis on inner-city growth.
Continued urbanisation requires a sustainable, intelligent
approach to area planning and development. One that
will help increase urban density while at the same time
improve the liveability and efficient use of space. The
decision to combine Residential Building and NonResidential in ‘Building & Technology’, under a single,
centralised management, is Heijmans’ pro-active
response to the issues raised by ongoing urbanisation.
This will enable us to combine processes, procurement
and expertise to create something greater than the sum of
its parts, while maintaining specific individual competencies. At the same time, it enables Heijmans to respond
effectively to the growing demand for multi-functional,
high-rise (residential) urban construction.
Non-Residential recorded markedly lower revenue in the
year under review. This was partly due to the strict
application and implementation of the margin-over-volume policy. At the same time, revenue declined as a
result of our decision to withdraw from the consortium for
the RIVM project. These factors had an impact on the
disappointingly negative result of Non-Residential for
2017. Heijmans has not scaled back the organisation in
line with this development, precisely because the
opportunities in inner city construction in the years
ahead create the prospect of new contracts. Digitalisation
also provides opportunities to add more value for clients,
which in turn creates opportunities for Heijmans in areas
such as data-driven maintenance and management, with
BeSense as a well-known example.
At Infra, we put a greater focus on line-infrastructure,
regional activities and asset management in 2017.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

APPENDICES

The aim of this is to improve the balance in the revenue
between large projects on the one hand and regional infra
projects, asset management and specialisms on the other.
This is in line with our tightened strategic focus and
continued de-risking of projects.

View to the future
We recorded considerable progress due to all the measures
we implemented and our newly-defined strategic direction,
and we have laid solid foundations for the future. In 2018,
these strategic parameters will remain our guiding principles
to safeguard this solid foundation. We will continue to work
on the further recovery of our profitability based on a clear
focus on core competencies, a selective acquisition policy
targeting margin over volume and tight controls on projects.
In 2018, we will therefore continue full throttle ahead with
the ‘tackle and press ahead’ approach we took in the year
under review. The appointment of Hans Janssen as the new
Chief Financial Officer has created a two-man Executive
Board, which will enable us to structure the executive
management of the organisation on our chosen course both
effectively and efficiently. A group board, which will also
include the chairs of the business areas and the Chief Risk
Officer, will report directly to the Executive Board from the
various operational disciplines. This enables us to work
closer to our operations and together we can safeguard more
direct management, with a strong focus on risk management, HR, procurement and IT contributing to the continued
development of our organisation, our processes and our
guiding role in the chain.
We have also created more room to look further ahead, on
the road to 2023, and we will continue to develop to
ensure we can continue to deliver added value to our
clients, our other stakeholders and society as a whole in
the future. We are building the spatial contours of
tomorrow and we believe in built environments that
combine quality, liveability and sustainability. Based on
this conviction, while we continue to improve our
foundations, Heijmans also wants to focus on making our
operations smarter and more sustainable. On this front,
our goal is to stay close to home in the innovations we
develop. These innovations will be based on the art of
‘making’ and the years of experience our people have built
up on projects. Building is and will remain a craft and we
want to develop and execute that craft to its full potential.
Finally, I would like to thank all Heijmans employees, the
Supervisory Board, the works council and our chain
partners for their efforts and spirit in the past year.
Together we make this company a success.

An estimated 32% of the depositary receipts for ordinary shares are held by institutional investors in the Netherlands.
This figure is lower than at year-end 2016 (35% in the Netherlands). An estimated 95% of the depositary receipts for
ordinary shares held by private investors are held in the Netherlands.

Share price movement
The closing price for the ordinary share was € 9.71 at year-end 2017. This represents an increase of some 75% compared
to the closing price for the 2016 financial year (€ 5.52), primarily as a result of the successful transition implemented in
the year under review. Key milestones in this respect were the settlement of a number of loss-making projects, the sale of
the Heijmans’ foreign operations and the consequent debt reduction, the refinancing and the recovery of profitability.
The AScX Index, which includes Heijmans, increased by 31% in the 2017 calendar year. The figure below shows the price

Profile
Mission and vision
The nature of the built environment is increasingly determined by the growing scarcity in
space, raw materials and other resources. At the same time, the built environment is subject to
ever increasing regulations and local complexities. This calls for solutions that are perfectly
executed, delivered on time, aesthetically sound and tailored to the end-user. This in turn
requires a high level of know-how and expertise to ensure the environment is structured and
developed to make it high-quality and future-proof. Heijmans is building the spatial contours
of today and tomorrow.

Organisation
Heijmans is a Dutch construction and development company, founded by Jan Heijmans in
1923. Heijmans was an innovator even back then, as it was one of the first companies to use
bituminous road surfacing. The post-war reconstruction boom subsequently provided ample
growth opportunities due to the renovation and laying of roads and airfields. In 1993,
Heijmans listed on the Amsterdam stock exchange. From mid-2008 onwards, the strategic
course of the company focused on creating added value on the basis of the integrated nature
of its various business units. Heijmans works continuously on the optimisation of processes,
improving its profit margins and working capital management, increasing efficiency and
boosting its capital ratios, as well as making room to focus on ways to renew. Heijmans is a
company that focuses entirely on the Dutch market in three different areas: property
development and residential building, non-residential and infrastructure. The activities are
divided into the business areas Property Development, Residential Building, Non-Residential
and Infra.
Heijmans is a centrally managed organisation, which creates synergy and direction and
facilitates the full development and roll-out of the company’s ‘Focus, Discipline and
Excellence’ strategy. Heijmans considers providing a safe working environment for employees and partners to be a basic premise. Heijmans has taken a number of significant steps on
the safety front and will continue to focus on further improvements in that area in the years
to come.

Heijmans’ construction and development activities as a whole create an integrated proposition for clients, from idea to
realisation, maintenance and management: from buildings and roads to area development. Heijmans’ business model is
therefore fully in line with the growing demand from clients for a combination of design, engineering, realisation,
maintenance and service. For end-users such as residential consumers, this combination of specialisations creates the
capacity to tailor the product exactly to the customers’ wishes.

* The management of Residential Building and Non-Residential has been centralised as of 1 January 2018 and the activities will be integrated
in the Building & Technology business area.

Heijmans has implemented or is planning to implement
three changes with respect to central staffing departments. In view of the fact that clients such as the Dutch
Department of Public Works and Water Management are
putting fewer PPP projects out to tender, we have
decided to incorporate the PPP department’s activities in
the various business units. This means we no longer
have a separate business unit for PPP activities, but that
we do retain the expertise. Secondly, we have made
preparations to boost HR expertise in terms of talent
development and culture and change management. On
top of this, Heijmans has decided to make the Chief Risk
Officer (CRO), who was initially appointed to head risk
management at Infra, the CRO for the entire Heijmans
N.V. organisation.
In terms of our business activities, Heijmans has decided
to centralise the management of Non-Residential and
Residential Building and we will effect this integration in
the course of 2018. The introduction of the ‘Building &
Technology’ business area will enable Heijmans to
further streamline underlying building processes and

existing know-how, while retaining everyone’s specific
competencies. In addition, the Netherlands is expected to
see a structural shortage of homes in the coming years,
with a growth forecast of more than one million
households in the period to 2030. The largest part of
this residential capacity will have to be built in innercity areas (estimate: approx. 60%) and in newly-created
out-of-town areas. This will put enormous pressure on
inner-city areas. At the same time, the available space is
steadily declining. This is increasing density and leading
to more high-rise construction, which in turn is leading
to more large-scale, multi-functional (residential)
inner-city new-build projects. The formation of the
‘Building & Technology’ business area gives us the
opportunity to respond effectively to the growth in
large-scale, inner-city new-build projects. These are
multi-functional developments that include the likes of
apartments, underground parking, commercial spaces,
as well as sustainable and smart technologies. Meeting
the challenge of these large-scale, multi-functional
inner-city new-build projects will require additional
competencies and skills. At the same time, it creates

PROFILE & STRATEGY

REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD

CORPORATE GOVERANCE

room for growth in Heijmans regional residential
building operations, as these large-scale, multi-functional inner-city new-build projects require a disproportionate effort from these organisations and resources.
Based in a social perspective and under pressure from
legal requirements related to energy labels for outdated
apartments due to come into force in 2030, we expect to
see a considerable growth in demolition & new-build
projects. Upgrading and renovation will result in a leap in
the energy performance of these homes, but given the
high investments these upgrades require, demolition &
new-build projects are now back on the cards. This utilises
both know-how in utilitarian building, the associated
know-how of technology in the field of comfort, sustainability and smart technology. It also requires knowledge of
markets and clients and expertise in the field of renovation and demolition & new-build of residential buildings.
Under this centralised management, Heijmans’ residential new-build operations will continue to collaborate with
Property Development in exactly the same way, both
substantively and in terms of know-how development.
Here too, the centralised management creates the
opportunity to further streamline processes and knowhow on the structural engineering front.

business area’s project portfolio. Residential Building
operates from five centrally managed regional offices.
The close, integrated collaboration between Property
Development and Residential Building leads to both
conceptual creativity and executive strength. This results
in residential concepts such as the Heijmans ONE,
Huismerk and Wenswonen, as well as the standardisation of the underlying operating processes and cooperation with partners and procurement. This enables us to
realise both complex inner-city transformation projects
and more series-based new-build projects.

Non-Residential
Non-Residential focuses on the healthcare (cure) market,
education (college and university buildings), commercial property for private parties and (semi) government
bodies, industry, data centres, leisure and utilitarian
housing construction.
Non-Residential designs, realises and maintains
high-quality electro-technical and mechanical engineering installations, on the basis of a selective acquisition
and tendering policy. Our unique selling point is the
integrated approach to construction and technical
installation services. Contracts increasingly include
long-term management and maintenance of both
buildings and their technical facilities.

Residential
Property Development
Property Development focuses on area development
and property development of both large and smaller-scale projects in inner-city and out-of-town areas and
acts as an initiator, developer and seller of residential
properties, both houses and apartments for either
owner-occupier or rental purposes, including social
rental housing. It conducts these activities from three
centrally managed offices. High-level knowledge of area
development is bundled in one area development
organisation, which is responsible for the accounts of
large clients. This means we can benefit from both
new-build contracts in the private sector and (inner-city)
transformation projects.
Residential Building
The core activity of Residential Building is to build
homes of different types. The activities of this business
area consist primarily of new-build projects, but also
include restoration, redevelopment and renovation of
existing housing stock. Residential Building’s activities
also include the transformation of buildings, in which
the original function is changed. Maintenance and
services account for an ever-increasing portion of this

Infrastructure: Infra
Infra’s activities focus on the laying, maintenance and
improvement of infrastructure, with an emphasis on
mobility, water and energy. Infra has extensive expertise
in line-infrastructure, which revolves mainly around
mobility for road users and road networks, but also on the
design of public spaces. This can be roads and underground infrastructure, but may also include installations
and technical services such as lighting, camera and
reference systems in and around roads and public spaces.
Infra is also active in carefully selected civil engineering
projects: location-linked infrastructure above and below
ground, such as viaducts, tunnels, cables, pipelines,
energy supplies, locks and water purification systems.
Infra’s focus is on the design, realisation, management
and maintenance of the structures and buildings, as well
as their technical installations.
Stakeholders
In the normal course of its business, Heijmans deals with a
broad playing field of contractors and clients, employees,
shareholders and other capital providers, suppliers and
subcontractors, the industry as a whole, public sector
bodies, knowledge and education institutions, social groups

and end-users. Heijmans interacts with these groups on a
continuous basis with a view to increasing the quality of its
products and services, as well as the support for its
activities, strategic choices and approach. This enables us to
create higher quality with sustainable value.
Each year, Heijmans organises a stakeholder dialogue
for each business area to discuss the strategy and the
majority of material issues with a diverse range of
groups. This stakeholder interaction is also an entirely
continuous process in which various instruments and
meetings help us to achieve our objectives. These are:
• Roadshows and conferences: Heijmans makes contact
with its shareholders and potential shareholders at
various times throughout the year in order to maintain
a dialogue with these groups. These contacts are not
confined to the General Meeting of Shareholders and
regular meetings with major shareholders, as we also
have individual discussions and meetings with existing
and new shareholders at so-called conferences. We had
a regular discussions with existing and potential
shareholders in the year under review, for instance
during roadshows and conferences.
• Analyst meetings: Heijmans has regular meetings
with analysts who follow our share and the company.
We organised analyst meetings for the presentation of
the annual and half year results and held analyst calls
when we published our trading updates in the spring
and autumn. The full-year and half year meetings can
be followed live via a webcast. Participants can also ask
questions via the webcast, which we also make
available on our website afterwards. Heijmans has an
investor relations manager to answer questions from
analysts and investors.
• Works council meetings: Heijmans directors hold
regular talks with the company’s works council. In
2017, there were intensive consultations between the
directors in the context of the transition the company
implemented, and the works council was able to use its
knowledge and network within the company to provide
valuable input for the structure and implementation of
the changes. The frequency of meetings, topics of
discussion, applications for approval and recommendations are outlined in the Corporate Governance
section on page 83.
• Online media: clients, stakeholders and other interested parties can obtain information about Heijmans via
the company’s interactive website. This information
ranges from project updates and Heijmans’ view on
relevant themes in society to the financial calendar
and press releases. All items can be shared and each
article lists a contact person for interested partners
who would like to discuss the subject. Heijmans is also

active on YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and
LinkedIn. By using this wide range of channels, the
company can access a broad target group, gather
opinions and gauge sentiment among stakeholders, as
well as engage in a dialogue.
• Capital providers and insurers: partly in view of the
developments in 2017, Heijmans maintains intensive
contacts with its capital providers and frequently
explains the financial results to these parties. Heijmans
also maintains contacts with credit insurers and
guarantors.
• Industry bodies: Heijmans maintains regular contacts
with organisations such as NEPROM, Bouwend
Nederland and Uneto-Vni and participates in various
consultation platforms.
Social trends and developments
Heijmans regularly enters into a dialogue with the
company’s stakeholders. These stakeholders are groups
or individuals who directly or indirectly influence the
realisation of the company’s objectives and/or are
affected by same. These include clients, employees,
shareholders and other capital providers, suppliers and
subcontractors, industry bodies, public sector bodies,
knowledge and educational institutions and social
groups. A summary of these stakeholder dialogues is
available in the appendices to this annual report. Based
on this dialogue, Heijmans has identified the following
trends and developments in the market:
• Digitalisation and new revenue models
The world around us is becoming increasingly digital,
especially the built environment. Sensor technology
and the Internet of Things are not only helping to
optimise processes and functions, they are also
creating connections between objects and their usage
data, which releases relevant data and creates added
value. This is true whether we are talking about a
stretch of asphalt, a piece of road, waste bins or
lampposts. And this also applies to homes or buildings, where sensors provide insights into usage,
providing a basis for the smarter and more efficient use
of resources. One example of this is BeSense, which
Heijmans developed with cleaning company CSU and
sensor manufacturer Clickey. This award-winning
product provides real-time insight into the use of
rooms via movement sensors, which means CSU can
deploy cleaning crews more efficiently. It also provides
accurate grounds for strategic choices in terms of
expansion or renovation. Thanks to the high value of
this information, a construction company can provide
data and added value at a strategic level, both at the
start end of the building process and at the end in

CORPORATE GOVERANCE

maintenance and asset management, above and
beyond the value of execution and realisation. The
value of these insights, as well as the interest in the
product itself, is creating new revenue models.
• Pressure on the housing market: imbalance supply
and demand, major regional differences
The Netherlands is leaving the economic crisis behind,
and there is growth in both the economy and employment. The market underwent a rapid turnaround in the
year under review. In the four major cities and the
areas in their immediate vicinity, we saw strong
growth in the demand for homes, both existing and
new-build. In particular, satellite cities that are close to
the big four (G4) cities and have large universities or
vocational colleges are also benefitting from this
growth. The imbalance between supply and demand,
primarily in urban areas, has led to considerable house
price rises in the areas described above. This has led to
a great deal of pressure on capacity, and Heijmans is
focusing on controlled growth, acceptable risks and
margin over volume in project acquisition. This also
has an impact on the chain of suppliers and partners.
The continuity of partnerships with a focus on
long-term cooperation and respect for each other’s
added value has a major impact on the ability to
actually build. The affordability of homes in urban
areas is under severe pressure as a result of these
developments. This in turn has resulted in an acceleration of these developments in suburban and peripheral
areas, where homes are once again drawing interest.
• Infra market: new balance in relationship principal /
contractor
The Infrastructure market has been under sustained
pressure in recent years. The decline in, for instance,
public sector investments plus a shrinking market have
resulted in surplus capacity and pressure on margins
and prices. On top of this, we are seeing a sustained
increase in risks, and there is a growing need for
innovative products and services to enable companies in
the sector to respond to the dynamics in demand. At the
initiative of a mixed group of clients, contractors,
suppliers and industry bodies, the sector has joined
forces and drawn up the so-called ‘Market vision’
document. This vision creates the potential to find a new
balance between supply and demand, as well as the
distribution of risks. On this front, important factors
include respect for reciprocal interests, the mark-down of
risks and room for innovation. More than 1,400 parties
have already signed the vision and action points have
been outlined for an improved tender practice.
• From possession to use in inner-city mobility
The sharing economy trend is continuing, especially

26

Annual Report 2017 - Heijmans

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

APPENDICES

on the mobility front. In big cities, shared cars as well
as shared bicycles are becoming more and more
common. This is affecting the capacity utilisation of
inner-city parking facilities and has led to calls for new,
more appropriate parking standards to respond to this
trend in a responsible and sustainable way in area
development projects. However, the impact on home
ownership is not particularly significant. After all, for
many target groups, owning a home is a major ideal,
inspired by the desire to create their own home. Not
forgetting the expected capital and thus pension
accrual, stimulated by favourable fiscal conditions.
• Energy transition
Driven in part by the climate goals set out in the Paris
agreement, there is a tangible urgency to make a
structural shift towards sustainable, non-fossil fuels.
The trend towards building without natural gas is a
key development on this front. Area developments,
homes and buildings will increasingly be built on an
‘all electric’ basis in the future. Especially given the
increased availability of the technology and combined
products and services required to actually decentralise
the generation and supply of energy. The EPC (Energy
Performance Coefficient – a norm for the expression of
energy performance of homes) standardisation will
continue to develop into ‘Beng’ (Bijna Energieneutraal
Gebouw – or nearly energy-neutral buildings)
standardisation, which will result in new, higher
targets for new-build projects. However, the most
important energy transition is still being seen in
existing buildings – via renovations and restructuring.
Driven in part by sensor technology and data collection, the progress we are seeing in technological
developments guarantee that the energy transition
will continue in the years ahead.
• Circularity and reuse – transformation and renovation
Thanks to technological and economic developments
and the desire for faster and improved production,
there is no sign of a let-up in the pressure on raw
materials and resources. We have become highly
dependent on externally produced raw materials. This
makes it absolutely crucial to think in terms of circular
systems, driven by the re-use of materials in closed
systems. This will also have an enormous impact on
the construction industry. This circular thinking and
acting will require a change in mindset and a good
deal of effort, but it will also create opportunities due
to the fact that many raw materials will be used
differently. At the same time, it is vital that this circular
approach is embedded in the entire lifecycle of the
object to be built: from design for re-use through
life-extending maintenance and collection and the
recycling of residual materials across the entire chain.

PROFILE & STRATEGY

• Availability of labour, products and services driven by market growth
As we have already noted, the market growth is also affecting the availability of labour, products and services in the
chain. Heijmans is responding to this through active chain management, by forging partnerships and the careful
selection of partners. The procurement policy Heijmans launched during the economic crisis is now paying off, due to
the long-term commitments and joint product and services development. At the same time, this market growth is also
increasing demand for labour. Heijmans is responding to this trend by offering a healthy and sustainable working
environment, as well as growth opportunities and career perspectives. However, recruiting the right people remains a
challenge, especially on the technical and project execution fronts. Collaborative alliances, the exchange of capacity
and continued investments in human capital are obviously important factors in dealing with this challenge.

Stakeholder dialogue as input for value creation

Heijmans differentiates itself by creating solutions with
its partners at an early stage in the design process, and
by realising and updating these solutions through the
integration of know-how and expertise. Heijmans creates
added value for clients and users by focusing on
continuous improvement, uniform processes and
standardisation where possible, with the aim of
managing both costs and risks. The work starts on the
drawing board and extends to include management,
maintenance and service. Heijmans combines know-how
and creativity to create innovative products and
concepts with a broad range of potential applications.
We aim to be an innovative player in the market. This
unique value can be found in the pioneering role that
the company plays on the innovation front. Excellent
examples of this include product innovations like the
Heijmans Huismerk, Heijmans ONE, bike safety concept
BikeScout, the BeSense sensor system, home controls,
and asphalt innovation Greenway LE.

Heijmans realises this added value through active chain
management and by increasing innovation and
synergy, know-how and expertise. To this end, Heijmans
cooperates with partners and uses the various capital
flows in the chain. Heijmans realises continuous
improvements through the centralised management of
tender and project management, procurement and
commerce and by setting central improvement targets
for same. Heijmans is increasing its use of LEAN
planning technologies, centralised and uniform
processes and systems. The business model meets the
demand from clients for integrated solutions that
combine design and engineering, realisation, maintenance and management. Heijmans creates added value
for clients, measured in terms of returns and satisfaction, through the application and combination of the
required expertise.

Materiality analysis
Method for the analysis of the most material issues
The analysis of the most material aspects was based on
the determination of the most relevant aspects by each
group of stakeholders. We generate input from desk
research and stakeholder meetings that are held
annually for each business area. You can find a
summary of these stakeholder meetings in the appendices to this annual report on page 242. We also conducted desk research to identify the relevant aspects. In this
annual report, we updated the aspects in the materiality
matrix by bringing together experts with knowledge of a
number of important trends and developments in the
market and at clients. We then assessed these trends
and developments and reviewed them against the
existing outcome of the materiality analysis.
We subsequently discussed this process in a steering
group in which all business units were represented and
the outcome was subsequently adopted by the Executive
Board. In the meantime, we used the materiality
analysis for discussions in the stakeholder meetings of
various business units. The main results of the above are
included in the report.
Analysis 2017
A number of items in the materiality analysis changed
compared to 2016. These were:
• The themes of energy transition and climate change
have been combined because neither of these items
are resulting in separate measures in the market at
this point in time.

28

Annual Report 2017 - Heijmans

HIGH PRIORITY

• Materials innovation and circular building have
become considerably more important on the basis of
the number of tenders in which a vision and approach
to this aspect has been requested, as well as feedback
from stakeholders.
• Continued efforts to increase the sustainability of
Heijmans’ products and services have been given a
higher priority than increasing the sustainability of
the company’s operations. This is the result of the
measures already introduced on the latter front.
• Stakeholders are indicating that the shortages in the
labour market are becoming more and more challenging, and this aspect has therefore increased in
importance.
• Environment management declined in importance in
requests/tenders over the past year and this aspect
has therefore become slightly less of a priority.
• In view of the scope of the procurement spend, the
aspect of purchasing/chain integration is gaining in
importance, relatively speaking. This aspect in
particular is important in tackling and developing
material aspects such as safety and innovations in the
chain and in partnerships.
• Stakeholders also indicate that digitalisation is an
important aspect for the future, which will have an
impact on both our products and services and our
operations. This is why we have added this aspect to
the materiality analysis.

Strategy
Vision for 2023
Urbanisation, pressure on the housing market, scarcity of raw materials and pressure on
fossil fuels, combined with a desire for flexibility and the acceleration of production and
technological development are creating a major challenge in terms of designing, realising
and maintaining liveability. As designer of the built environment, the construction
industry plays a considerable role in overcoming this challenge. Heijmans can and wants
to make the difference in terms of how we deal with scarcity and how we develop quality
in the short and the long term. This will take a lot of effort. With that awareness in mind,
and in addition to its focus on continuously improveming its performance as a foundation
for the company, Heijmans wants to focus on increasing the use of smart and sustainable
technologies. Digitalisation and individualisation are key developments in this context, but
so are professionalism and realisation capability. Being able to build what has been
designed is vitally important. Connecting design with realisation, and the delivery of a
sustainable perspective is what Heijmans sees at its main tasks for the future.

Long term strategy: on the road to 2023
Since 2013, Heijmans has focused on the strategic vision ‘the Spatial Contours of
Tomorrow’. This is an image of the future in which Heijmans is the designer and initiator of
the spatial world around us. An environment marked by a rapid succession of new
developments, increasing complexity due to regulations, and a growing need for ‘faster
and better’, as well as the increasing assertiveness of users and stakeholders. This is
increasing the pressure on resources and makes handling the growing scarcity of raw
materials and resources and spatial quality the key challenges for the sector. Heijmans
wants to contribute rather than detract on this front: in terms of energy, space and
materials. To that end, Heijmans first and foremost delivers high-quality solutions for its
clients and their clients. These days, the usage phase – an optimum use of the built
environment – is increasingly the basic premise for everything Heijmans develops, realises
and maintains. And Heijmans ultimately also adds value for society, with human capital,
know-how and technology.

Added value
In addition to actual building, design is, now more than
ever before, the distinctive component in Heijmans’
activities. Heijmans is increasingly developing into a
knowledge business, as well as a building company.
Heijmans differentiates itself by creating solutions with
its partners at an early stage in the design process, and
by realising and maintaining these solutions through
the integration of know-how and expertise; and by
combining know-how and creativity into innovative
products and concepts with a broad range of applications. Innovation at Heijmans is embodied in the form of
know-how, technology and product development, in
Heijmans’ areas of expertise, close to the business and in
cooperation with clients. Examples include the Heijmans
ONE, the standard application of smart home-control
technology, the BeSense sensor system, BikeScout
cycling safety system and the development of innovative asphalt products, such as self-healing asphalt,
Recoflex and Greenway LE.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

APPENDICES

innovative approach is a key factor in this respect. The
extent to which Heijmans is able to do this and do it
profitably determines how successful we are as a
company. What this means is that we have to have our
core processes in order. The goal is a healthy company
with healthy margins. ‘Doing what we are good at’ is a
key factor in all of this: Heijmans focuses on activities
and areas of expertise where it can add value. Based on
its strategic plan 2017-2019, Heijmans is now focused
on the continuous improvement of its core activities
through tender management, project management
bundling and strengthening procurement and commercial strength. This continuous improvement is aimed at
reducing costs and controlling risks, increasing profitability, strict working capital management, efficiency and
margins, as well as strengthening Heijmans’ market
position by adding more value. This also enables the
company to offer new products and services that help it
provide its clients with even higher levels of service.
The strategic plan is based on three pillars:

Having put the core company back on track, we have
laid the basis for the company to look further ahead into
the future. In doing so, we have combined the developments in the construction sector and society with
Heijmans’ vision and expertise to create a strategic
agenda for the period through to 2023. In this process,
we have devoted specific attention to developments such
as digitalisation, energy transition and production
technology. This strategic agenda helps Heijmans to not
only continue its improvement drive, but also enables
the company to continue to focus on making our
operations, products and services smarter and more
sustainable.
We have taken the first steps towards 2023 with a
number of choices we have made with respect to staff
departments and an adjustment in the organisation of
our business activities. Since clients are putting fewer
PPP projects out to tender, we decided to integrate the
activities of the PPP department in the business units as
of the end of 2017. In addition, the Chief Risk Officer
(CRO) initially appointed at Infra has been appointed as
the CRO for Heijmans N.V. This integrated approach at
group level will raise risk management to a higher level
right across the company. We have also made preparations to boost HR’s expertise in the field of culture, talent
and organisational development.

Short term strategy 2017 - 2019: Focus,
Discipline, Excellence
The added value Heijmans offers its clients determines
the company’s right to exist. An integrated and

36

Annual Report 2017 - Heijmans

• Focus (margin):
Heijmans is transforming itself into a purely Dutch
company with a clearer focus on core competencies in
the areas of property development, residential building,
non-residential and infrastructure. Heijmans will focus
on those areas in the market where its strengths lie,
which means Heijmans can provide even greater added
value to clients, which they are also willing to pay for.
This translates into a ‘margin-over-volume’ policy and
the selective acquisition of new projects. The pricing of
these new contracts will therefore be based on the added
value Heijmans provides for its clients (‘willingness to
pay’) and will at the very least be based on the minimum margins Heijmans uses for tender quotes.
• Discipline (de-risking):
In order to reduce risks sustainably, we continuously
monitor systems and processes, GO/NO GO moments
and escalation steps and tighten these procedures on a
regular basis. We acquire large-scale projects with
risk-bearing partners to spread risks and optimise
competencies. Heijmans maintains tight cost management, so our cost structure is in line with the scope of a
company focused on the Netherlands. It also allows us
to remain competitive and reduce our dependence on
large-scale, high-risk projects.
• Excellence (realisation):
Heijmans wants to deliver excellent performance in its
areas of expertise. Repetition enables us to build up
know-how and expertise and constantly refine

PROFILE & STRATEGY

REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD

CORPORATE GOVERANCE

sophisticated routines. That increases opportunities for
performance improvement and positive margin
development. We have made changes at various
management levels to build an effective organisation.
Heijmans also wants to differentiate itself in the market
on the basis of its core competencies. Concepts such as
Heijmans Huismerk homes aim for excellent execution
with a target of ‘zero snagging items’ and will therefore
help us to achieve that ambition.

2017: Progress strategy implementation
In 2017, we took a number of significant steps in the
transformation of Heijmans into a purely Dutch
company. The completion of the sale of our foreign
subsidiaries in the spring of 2017 meant we completed
this process in the early part of the year under review.
GRIP
With the launch of the ‘Improve the core’ programme in
2012, Heijmans laid the foundations for the improvement of its core processes in the field of tender management, project management, procurement and
commerce. In 2017, we launched a programme dubbed
GRIP aimed at further improvements to project control,
the key role in project management. We organised
meetings last spring with controllers, project managers,
lawyers and contract experts to gain insight into their
experiences and use those experiences to assess
opportunities for improvements. This revealed that while
we have indeed taken a number of positive steps in
terms of the tender process, there is still room for
improvement, especially in the preparation and
realisation stages. GRIP creates a platform within the
organisation that ensures we can take those practical
steps and that we monitor and manage the progress.
GRIP represents: no more surprises in projects, more
control and solid project management to increase the
predictability in projects. The programme builds on
previously introduced principles for process and risk
control, such as Tender and Project management. The
GRIP programme also devotes specific attention to the
timeliness, comprehensiveness and transparency of the
project information, and to encouraging the desired
behaviour on this front, as well as to calling out
behaviour that is not conducive to this. GRIP also wants
to encourage the correct use of the available tools and
contribute to an improved match between the project
controller and the various risk categories of the projects
they have in their portfolio.
Placing these aspects under the header of GRIP makes
their interrelation much clearer and it generates more
synergies across the business areas. Together with the

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

APPENDICES

culture programme ‘IK’, this has also created an
awareness and change in attitudes and conduct with
respect to improvements and optimisations. Monitoring
the extent to which people are following the agreed
processes and the number of unexpected developments
should reveal whether the above actually reduces the
number of surprises.
Tender and project management
Heijmans has professionalised the tender management
process over the past few years and continued that
process in 2017, partly driven by the GRIP programme.
We also continued with the translation of project
management from analysis and tooling to follow-up
and implementation. Heijmans considers contract
management a key part of this. All tender projects have
been put into the central system (the Tender Template)
in recent years. The system is audited to check the
quality of the input. These audits act as a permanent
stimulus for training and project improvement. In 2017,
we also made progress in the project risk analyses. This
categorisation forms the basis for the coordination and
recording of the project and related process with clients.
Procurement
Vision for procurement, chain integration and
collaboration
Heijmans and its suppliers, subcontractors and partners
bear joint chain responsibility. Heijmans wants to do
business with its suppliers, subcontractors, partners and
service providers in a transparent and professional
manner. Heijmans’ choice of partners is always based
on objective business considerations. Heijmans has a
sustainable procurement policy that creates the
conditions to do so. The procurement strategy is aimed
at involving procurement professionals in the early
stages of the process, which allows us to find solutions
at an early stage and in cooperation with suppliers,
helping us to optimise efficiency and quality. Key
premises in this are safety, sustainability and circularity.
You can find our full procurement policy on the
Heijmans website.
Collaboration in the chain
The procurement volume remained unchanged at
around 70-80% of revenue, in the year under review. This
makes intensive collaboration in the chain crucial.
Heijmans therefore focuses strongly on selecting the
right partners for collaboration. Heijmans and its
suppliers / subcontractors increasingly commit at an
early stage in view of this intensive collaboration.
This is based on long-term collaboration with fixed
partners, which results in the joint development of

Annual Report 2017 - Heijmans

37

PROFILE & STRATEGY

REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD

CORPORATE GOVERANCE

products and services and high delivery reliability. This
form of collaboration reduces the cost of failure and
helps create sustainable and innovative solutions for
clients. By means of socially responsibly procurement,
Heijmans helps minimise the negative impact of its
operations and the utilisation of natural resources. And
by involving its contractors in the acceptance of this
responsibility, Heijmans also contributes to improvements in social aspects, such as labour conditions,
safety, health and the environment. Safety is also a
priority when cooperating with co-makers, subcontractors and suppliers and working safely is a key criterion
in the selection of chain partners. When it comes to
safety, Heijmans wants to be a trendsetter in the entire
chain.
The development and realisation of the Heijmans
Huismerk is one example of the co-creation we are
striving for. These homes are based on standardised
processes developed in close cooperation with chain
partners. This reduces the cost of failure and increases
margins. In addition, it means that Heijmans is developing a way of building and organising, together with its
partners, which is based on repetition and refinement
rather than exclusively on one-off projects, and this
results in a joint learning curve for everyone involved.
With a view to the United Nations sustainable development goals and in line with the ISO 20400 systems, we
scan each (cluster of) product group(s) in terms of
impact and material aspects that require attention. This
can be very different from one product group to the next,
which is why we strive to customise the approach on
this front. In view of current trends and developments
and inspired by the United Nations sustainable
development goals, Heijmans expects to see a great deal
more attention devoted to circularity and consequently
waste processing and raw materials in the procurement
process. We also believe that we all have to make every
effort to re-use raw materials and other materials and to
develop alternative construction methods. Partly with
this in mind, Heijmans once again tightened its
sustainable procurement policy at the end of 2017. The
full policy document is available on the Heijmans
website.
Responsibility
On the procurement front, Heijmans believes this also
involves accepting responsibility for the deployment of
suppliers, subcontractors and freelancers and the
associated regulations in areas such as chain liability,
hiring liability, and the Dutch Sham Employment
Arrangements Act (Wet Aanpak Schijnconstructies). With

38

Annual Report 2017 - Heijmans

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

APPENDICES

this in mind, Heijmans works with preferred suppliers
that are selected in advance. These account for around
half of the total spend. These preferred suppliers use the
contract models drawn up by Heijmans, plus any
relevant additional stipulations. This ensures correct
dossier compilation, that there is a procedure for
(suspected) abuses and that the deployment of freelancers is managed centrally. In addition, workers at the
building locations are identified according to uniform
procedures.
Continued professionalisation procurement, actions 2017:
In 2017, we continued to professionalise procurement:
• Preferred suppliers and subcontractors
Heijmans has more than 400 product groups that are
divided into 10 clusters. In the past year, we conducted
a more detailed analysis of a number of these product
groups that are of particular importance to the
construction sector. On the basis of that analysis, we
then took a number of additional steps, selected
preferred suppliers and introduced tighter quality
requirements. This process is continuous and is
constantly refined, as product innovations and the
demands from clients are also constantly evolving.
• Continued digitalisation of processes and collaboration
with chain partners
We continued to digitalise the procurement process in
2017 by optimising the SAP process and fully
digitalising contract processing with suppliers. This
has greatly reduced the throughput time of contract
closure and dossier creation, plus it has simplified the
handling of these procedures. We have also created
digital connections with numerous suppliers and
structured associated processes to realise fast and
efficient processing of orders and payments.
• Supplier assessment system
Since Heijmans procures a considerable proportion of
its revenue, it is highly dependent on the quality and
performance of third parties when it comes to the
quality of the end product. In 2017, Heijmans started a
pilot with construction industry quotation platform
12Build for an evaluation platform (Evaluator), with the
aim of improving quality and reducing the costs of
failure, while at the same time boosting transparency.
Via this initiative, Heijmans is working to create greater
transparency of the performance delivered and a
taking a step forward in quality, which should
ultimately be expressed in the quality of the final
product, a construction, any associated services and in
customer satisfaction.

CORPORATE GOVERANCE

Commerce
In 2016, Heijmans introduced a customer relationship
management (CRM) system at Property Development
and Residential Building. In 2017, the company
optimised and further standardised the associated
working method. The goal is to implement the CRM
system in the other business areas too, which will
provide us with insight into the shared client base.
On a company-wide basis, we are making steady
progress in the implementation of the sales funnel,
which provides insight into the process of project
acquisition and client requirements. Heijmans makes
analyses of market segments and client groups for each
business area, together with an analysis of expected new
projects and the match with the company’s own
acquisition and acceptance policy. This gives the
company a much clearer view in terms of market
developments, the commercial translation into market
volume and opportunities for Heijmans, which consequently gives the company a better footing in the tender
or acquisition process.
With the aid of the annual sales conference, Heijmans
devotes attention to company-wide, strategic themes,
market and client developments, and the developments
of commercial competencies and skills. In the year
under review, Heijmans organised the fifth edition of this
sales conference, during which we introduced the ‘Hand
of Heijmans’. This is a storyline that highlights
Heijmans distinctive capabilities on the basis of relevant
project examples.
Within the business area Residential, Heijmans has
decided to replace the B2C customer relationship
system, which supports private sales. The new system
will focus on the improvement of the overall customer
experience, the so-called customer journey: from
exploratory stages through to delivery of the home and
services once in use.
Customer appreciation
• Property Development and Residential Building
Based on the customer satisfaction measurements
carried out by external organisation SKB, buyers of a
Heijmans home gave an average customer satisfaction
rating of 7.17 in 2017. The average of all participating
building companies was 7.06 (a difference of 0.11). At
the time of publication, 172 of the 430 buyers who
were approached had completed a buyer report.
Heijmans also registers the number of snagging items
per home and aims for ‘zero snagging items’. In 2017,
Heijmans registered 2,000 homes as delivered and

40

Annual Report 2017 - Heijmans

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

APPENDICES

registered the snagging items of 97.1% of these homes
(1,941 homes). A total of zero snagging items were
registered in 1,275 of these 1,941 homes (65.7%).
• Non-Residential and Infra
The forum of principals in the construction industry
(Opdrachtgeversforum) has expressed a desire to
professionalise the construction process and bolster
the construction chain. This has resulted in an
agreement between the Dutch government’s real
estate agency (Rijksvastgoedbedrijf), ProRail and the
Dutch Ministry of Public Works and Water
Management (Rijkswaterstaat) to develop a method to
assess the performance of their contractors. The
instrument these three organisations developed is
geared towards their own fields of operation and
adapted where possible, with the explicit ambition to
further professionalise matters on the side of the
principal, as well as on the side of the contractor.
Performance measurement focuses on the quality of
the process used to realise projects and is consequently an instrument that will help further professionalise
the relationship between principal and contractor. The
measurement is uniform for all contractors.
• Infra
ProRail
At ProRail in particular Heijmans noted a decline in
performance in the second half of 2017. One of the
projects is performing less well, which led to a drop in
the average to the same annual result as at year-end
2016 (2016: 7.2 – on a scale of 10). At ProRail, the
measurement - and consequently the comparison
- covers around 25 parties. Heijmans’ performance puts
it in the middle of that group. Heijmans aims to be
among the top 5 best-performing contractors at
ProRail. Heijmans also aims for an annual average
client satisfaction rating of 8.0 or higher.
Dutch Ministry of Public Works and Water
Management
Heijmans noted a positive development at the Dutch
Ministry of Public Works and Water Management. At
year-end 2016, the performance score was 7.6 (out of
10) and at year-end 2017, this had risen to 8.1.
Heijmans aims for an annual average client satisfaction rating that is higher than an 8.0.
Examples of Heijmans projects that show how quality
and professional collaboration can come together are
the Eurojust project delivered in March 2017 and the
ongoing A9 infrastructure project.

Process optimisation
Since 2010, Heijmans has used Lean6Sigma to improve
processes and encourage a culture of improvement. The
company has launched a total of 413 projects since the
start of the initiative. In 2017, we launched 148 projects,
an increase on the number of projects launched in 2016
due to the effect of the company-wide SAP implementation, which has released significant amounts of data for
strategic LEAN projects. The focus in these projects is on
the implementation of lean tools. Heijmans also makes
extensive use of other tools, such as Lean plans and 5S.
Heijmans also devotes considerable attention to the
controlled execution of primary processes. Using KPIs,
the company targets crucial process stages and the
follow-up of same. This means that the Lean6Sigma
method supports the GRIP programme.
Process and system harmonisation
Heijmans completed the company-wide implementation of SAP in 2017, with the implementation of the SAP
ERP platform at the Property Development business
area. This means that the entire Heijmans organisation
now runs a single ERP environment and therefore has a
set of uniform processes. This increases transparency,
opportunities for data analysis and generates additional
cost savings. In 2018, Heijmans will launch the implementation of a HR system called ‘Workday’, aimed at
introducing uniform processes to support Heijmans’
human resources management.

Highlights 2017
Heijmans recorded a strong recovery in net result in 2017, compared with previous years.
The recovery in profit was largely due to three factors. First of all, Heijmans recorded
continued growth in revenue and margin in Residential Building and Property Development.
This growth was particularly strong in the Property Development segment, which benefitted
from shortages in the housing market, which in turn resulted in a strong increase in house
prices (including purchasing costs payable by vendor). In addition, the operating result at
Infra was positive, while Heijmans recorded a significant loss in this segment in 2016
(underlying EBITDA of € 16 million, compared to € 73 million negative in 2016). At Infra, the
company saw a broad improvement in results compared with the previous year, which was
marked by substantial project losses. Although there were also some project losses in 2017,
these were offset for by the impact of the broad margin improvement. This improvement in
results was due to a smaller share of loss-making projects from previous years, the contribution from profit-generating projects, combined with a higher volume and lower overhead
costs. Finally, the book profit from the sale of Heijmans foreign subsidiaries, which amounted to a total of € 31 million, also contributed to the improvement in the net result. This book
profit was a result of the sale of the German subsidiary Overmann and Heijmans Belgium,
with both sales completed in April 2017.
The net result (including foreign subsidiaries) for the full year 2017 was € 20 million (2016: a
loss of € 110 million). The revenue from the continued Dutch activities was slightly higher at
€ 1,402 million (2016: € 1,370 million). Growth in Residential Building and Property
Development (especially Property Development), and to a lesser extent Infra, was offset to
some extent by a decline in revenue at Non-Residential. The results at Non-Residential
lagged in 2017, partly as a result of substantially lower revenue and the under-coverage of
overheads. The lower revenue was due to a strict acquisition policy and an additional loss
related to Heijmans’ withdrawal from the RIVM project. The underlying EBITDA was
considerably higher at € 31 million (2016: € 47 million negative). Non-cash write down of
real estate and land holdings, restructuring costs and the book profit on the sale of the
German and Belgian subsidiaries also had a considerable impact on the net result, together
amounting to € 14 million in total.

Revenue from continued operations increased slightly to
€ 1,402 million in 2017 (2016: € 1,370 million). This
increase was largely due to growth in the housing
market, which Property Development in particular
benefitted from considerably, both in terms of an
increase in the number of homes sold and a rise in
house prices (including purchasing costs payable by
vendor). The number of homes sold was 2,192 (2016:
1,962), with 1,394 (64%) of these sold to private buyers
and 798 homes (36%) sold to investors (2016: 1,019 /
52% to private buyers and 943 / 48% to investors).
The increase in house values can be seen in the average
price (including purchasing costs payable by vendor
and excluding VAT) of the homes sold to private buyers:
this was € 299,000 in 2017 (2016: € 243,000).
Revenue at Property Development increased to € 391
million, from € 332 million in 2016. Residential
Building recorded revenue of € 297 million in the year
under review, from € 296 million in 2016.

Residential Building is faced with challenging market
conditions. On the demand side, there is strong growth
in an ever-increasing number of areas in the
Netherlands. This strong increase in demand has led to
considerable pressure on the availability and affordability of suppliers, as well as rising costs. The suppliers
channel requires constant monitoring to safeguard the

PROFILE & STRATEGY

REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD

CORPORATE GOVERANCE

desired quality of delivery and margin development. In
that context, Residential Building is strictly focused on a
selective acquisition policy and controlled growth, with
a considerable proportion of capacity being kept
available to safeguard the growing production at
Property Development. In 2017, approximately 65% of
the Residential Building revenue was sourced via
Property Development. Revenue from the Infra activities
in the Netherlands rose to € 680 million in 2017, from €
621 million in 2016. Unlike in the previous year, Infra
was not faced with large-scale delayed projects, such as
the N23 road project, thanks to which revenue was at a
good level and more evenly distributed across the year.
The decline in revenue at Non-Residential, to € 240
million from € 315 million in 2016, was largely due to
the continued implementation of the tight acquisition
and tender policy, in combination with a loss of revenue
as a consequence of Heijmans’ withdrawal from the
RIVM project. When the project eventually launched,
Heijmans decided to withdraw from the consortium,
which means Strukton will accept responsibility for the
entire execution. Revenue remained stable in the
Services segment, which focuses on service, management and maintenance contracts.
In view of the strategic adjustments to transform
Heijmans into a fully Dutch company, Heijmans
disinvested its German and Belgian subsidiaries. The
German subsidiary Franki was sold to PORR in
December 2016 (effected in January 2017). The sale of
Oevermann, also to PORR, was completed in April 2017.
Heijmans agreed on a transaction with Besix for
Heijmans’ three Belgian companies, Heijmans Bouw,
Heijmans Infra and Van den Berg, which was also
completed in April 2017. The revenue shown for foreign
activities in 2017 is entirely attributable to these
discontinued activities.

Underlying EBITDA
The underlying EBITDA is the operating result before
depreciation, including the EBITDA from joint ventures,
less any adjustments in the valuation of real estate and
land holdings, restructuring costs, the cost of soil
remediation and other exceptional items. In 2017,
underlying EBITDA for the Dutch operating companies
was € 30 million (2016: underlying EBITDA NL: € 73
million negative). The breakdown per sector is as follows:

The underlying EBITDA increased to € 31 million in
2017, from € 47 million negative in 2016. The German
and Belgian companies contributed € 26 million to the
underlying EBITDA in 2016, while in 2017 this amounted to € 1 million in the period up to the sale (April 2017).
The continued growth in the housing market resulted in
an increase in the result of Property Development
(underlying EBITDA 2017: € 20 million, from € 15
million in 2016) and a slight increase at Residential
Building (underlying EBITDA 2017: € 5 million, from € 4
million in 2016). At Residential Building, which is
operating in a highly competitive market, controlled
growth with a clear focus on quality remains a priority.
Availability and affordability of suppliers and people
require attention in the current market conditions.
Solid preparation of works and timely procurement are
essential to maintaining margins during execution, as
are reaching clear agreements on price indexing in
contracts with third parties. At Property Development,
Heijmans continued to develop integrated area development as one of its core activities, in part by investing in
conceptual competencies and acumen. Intensive
cooperation between Residential Building and Property
Development results in a combination of execution
strength and manufacturability, plus it creates the
opportunity to work efficiently while maintaining a low
cost base. Particularly in an expanding market, it
remains crucial to maintain focus on failure costs,
standardisation and quality. In addition, it is increasingly important to resume targeted investments in new
land holdings, to enable Heijmans to respond effectively
to continued growth prospects in the market. In recent
years, many positions from the existing land holdings
portfolio have been taken into development and this

process will continue in the years to come. In that
context, it is important to start thinking now about
revenue after 2020.
The underlying EBITDA at Non-Residential was € 6
million negative in 2017. As in the previous year, the
RIVM project in Utrecht had a negative impact on this
result. In 2017, Hurks and Heijmans decided to withdraw
from the project, in consultation with consortium partner
Strukton. The project financiers and principals have since
provided the required approvals. As a result of this
decision, Heijmans has taken a loss of € 3.5 million on
the RIVM project. Heijmans has no further involvement in
the execution and exploitation of this PPP project. The
decision to withdraw was primarily inspired by the desire
for continued de-risking. The result of Non-Residential
was also impacted negatively by a highly selective
acquisition policy for new projects. The market conditions
in Non-Residential, especially in the field of new build,
remained poor in 2017 and this meant Non-Residential
acquired insufficient work to maintain revenue at previous
levels. This led to underutilisation of the workforce. Efforts
aimed at increasing sustainability and high demand for
inner-city living and consequently multi-functional
high-rise residential building projects offer good perspectives for 2018.
The result of the Infra activities improved strongly in
2017 compared to previous years, with underlying
EBITDA at € 16 million. The 2016 result was strongly
impacted in particular by substantial project losses on
four large-scale integrated works. In 2017, Heijmans
made a major effort to get the results back to acceptable
levels. This effort included the (continued) settlement of
high-risk projects from the past, streamlining of the cost
structure and a tightening of the focus to prevent
large-scale project losses on new works. We made solid
progress on all fronts. Heijmans also made some
adjustments to the management structure and added
the position of Chief Risk Officer (CRO) at Infra. The CRO
plays a key role, as independently as possible, both in
the intake of new works and in resolving problems in
existing projects, to safeguard the overarching interests
of the company. In 2018, we will roll out this function
across the entire company. This should aid in the further
realisation of the desired de-risking of the company.
With respect to the settlement of risk projects from the
past, Heijmans made solid progress in the execution of
the Drachtsterweg and the N23. Both projects are on
schedule and are subject to well-documented agreements ahead of the delivery. With respect to the
Wilhelminasluis, Heijmans is awaiting the definitive
ruling of the Arbitration Board for the building industry

(Raad van Arbitrage voor de Bouw). With respect to the
A9 project, Heijmans took a provision due to the
additional efforts required for the realisation of the
tunnel. Work is progressing steadily ahead of the
delivery of the tunnel to the Dutch Ministry of Public
Works and Water Management (delivery for use), which
is scheduled for end-June 2018. The company also
reduced the cost structure at Infra and made less use of
external employees. In terms of commercial focus,
Heijmans decided to create an improved balance in the
order portfolio between large, integrated works and
regional projects, specialisms and asset management.
Heijmans will not withdraw from the market for large,
integrated projects, but the company will focus solely
on those projects that are in line with the strategic focus
and will work with risk-bearing partners where
necessary.

Operating result
The operating result for 2017 was € 45 million, compared with negative operating result of € 94 million in
2016. In addition to the negative impact of restructuring
costs, the downward value adjustment of some real
estate and land holdings and the cost of soil remediation, book profits on the sale of Heijmans foreign
subsidies had a positive effect on the operating result.
The operating result can be broken down as follows:

outside the Randstad area had an impact on the result.
This pertained to value adjustments of real estate and
land holdings in the peripheral regions of the
Netherlands, where the lagging development in house
prices in relation to the rising procurement costs play a
role, as well as delays in plan development at public
sector bodies. This has an impact on the valuation of
these land holdings. The total value adjustment for the
real estate and land holding was € 6 million in 2017. In
addition, there was a € 3 million item in non-operational
items related to soil remediation.

million in October 2017. Heijmans expects this to result in
a slight decline in interest expenses in the year ahead.

Income tax
The effective income tax rate was 11% in 2017. The
untaxed book profits on the sale of Heijmans’ foreign
subsidiaries had a positive impact on the effective
income tax rate. Non-deductible interest expenses on the
cumulative financing preference shares B and the
non-deductible mixed expenses had a negative impact
on the effective tax rate.

Restructuring costs

Capital and financing

As a result of some adjustments to the senior management of the company and a number of organisational
adjustments, inspired by the strategic reassessment we
conducted in 2017, the restructuring costs in 2017 were
€ 8 million (2016: € 4 million).

related to the Belgian and German activities were
already recognised under assets held for sale in 2016.
The majority of other non-current assets consist of
holding values from joint ventures in which Heijmans
participates.
The other non-current assets include a pension receivable of € 30 million for the Heijmans pension fund. The
receivable claim is based on the assumption that this
closed plan will gradually wind down, and on the
conclusion that Heijmans, as the employer, will
eventually be the sole remaining stakeholder and that
the final balance will therefore logically accrue to
Heijmans. Heijmans expects possible new IFRS regulations may mean that this receivable will eventually no
longer be included in the statement of financial position.
The pension fund executive and Heijmans are also
currently in talks on a possible (partial) reinsurance. If
these talks should result in a decision in favour of a
(partial) reinsurance, this may lead to a decline in the
pension receivable. Both of these situations would also
have a negative impact of a few percentage points on
Heijmans’ solvency.

The working capital fluctuates significantly during the
year. This can be project-specific and related to payment
schedules, or may be due to discussions regarding the
progress of a project. The construction sector is marked
by a seasonal pattern with higher levels of activity in the
second and fourth quarters, which has an especially

50

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

APPENDICES

marked impact on the Infra and Non-Residential
segments. Many contractual discussions are financially
settled in the fourth quarter of the year, particularly
those pertaining to large, integrated projects.
Working capital is usually at its lowest level at the end
of the year. Higher working capital requirements in the
course of the year result in a greater capital utilisation,
which Heijmans primarily finances through the use of a
revolving credit facility. The refinancing agreed in early
2017 also includes an agreement to reduce the total
commitment under this facility gradually to € 122
million at year-end 2019, from € 256 million at
year-end 2016. Heijmans had reduced this facility to €
156 million at year-end 2017. The reduction of this
facility has increased the need to limit fluctuations in
the working capital across the year in order to monitor
the room in the facility throughout the year.
Heijmans used a combination of measures to substantially reduce the absolute size of the working capital
fluctuations in 2017. These included a reduction of the
impact of claims and disputes at the level of Work in
progress and loss provisions and the sale of foreign
subsidiaries that also had strong seasonal fluctuations
in working capital. Another measure was to increase the
focus in the Fit for Cash programme on the gradual
distribution across the year of both production and the
financial settlement of large-scale transactions (such as
settlements in integrated contracts or investor deals at
Property Development). Thanks to this combined with
the €97 million in cash revenue from the sale of
Heijmans’ foreign activities, Heijmans successfully
created more than sufficient headroom in the revolving
credit facility throughout 2017.
The item receivables does not include material items
involving contested invoices or debtors with payment
difficulties. A large proportion of the clients are (semi)
public sector bodies with strong credit worthiness and
short payment terms. This enables Heijmans to keep the
average term of receivables outstanding at a low level.
The average period of receivables outstanding declined
somewhat last year due to the fact that current pressure
on the supplier side increased the emphasis on shorter
payment terms.
Work in Progress (assets and liabilities netted) improved
in 2017 – in other words, there was more pre- financing
- because at Infra in particular Heijmans agreed good
payment schedules for new and existing works and also
made solid progress in the settlement of risk projects.

In view of the importance Heijmans attaches to the
further improvement of balance sheet ratios and the
reduction of the revolving credit facility, the company has
decided not to pay out a dividend on (depositary receipts
for) ordinary shares for the financial year 2017.

Financing: net interest-bearing debt
The net cash position at year-end 2017 was € 14 million
(2016: € 146 million net debt after reclassification to
assets held for sale and € 100 million debt before
reclassification to assets held for sale). On balance, net
debt declined by € 114 million, with a contribution of € 97
million from the sale of the foreign subsidiaries (including
book profits). Although some of the losses taken in 2016
and 2017 had yet to be recognised in the cash position,
Heijmans nonetheless had a positive operational cash
flow as a result of the strong focus on working capital and
the recovery in its results. The so-called recourse net cash
position (see section 6.20 of the financial statements for
an explanation), which is also the basis for agreements
with banks, stood at € 59 million at year-end 2017 (2016:
net debt of € 49 million, rather than a net cash position).

Refinancing 2017
In early 2017, Heijmans reached agreement on the
credit facility the syndicate of banks consisting of ABN
Amro, ING, KBC and Rabobank made available to the
company. These agreements were laid down on 31
March 2017 in a new agreement valid until 30 June
2019. As part of the refinancing agreement, Heijmans
agreed to a gradual reduction of the facility from € 256
million to € 122 million on 30 June 2019. Partly as a
result of the divestments realised, the facility had
already been reduced to € 156 million by October 2017,
eight months earlier than initially agreed with the
banks. KBC will gradually withdraw from the syndicate
in the period between mid-2018 and mid-2019. The
reduction of the facility to € 122 million from € 156
million is entirely related to the withdrawal of the KBC’s
remaining commitment to the facility.

As of 2018, the financial covenants applicable before
2017 are once again in effect. In view of the substantial
debt reduction realised in 2017 and the expected
continued improvement in underlying EBITDA in 2018,
Heijmans expects to operate within the agreed covenants in 2018.
With respect to the score on the covenants applicable
from 2018, we refer to section 6.20 for a breakdown of
the calculation method, as well as comparable figures.
Given the substantial reduction of the net debt and the
realised recovery of the rolling EBITDA, Heijmans would
have already met the terms of these covenants as of Q4
2017.
In line with the definitions in the financing agreement,
Heijmans must adjust a number of aspects of the
EBITDA, net financing expenses and the net debt as
reported in the financial statements. The main adjustments pertain to the inclusion of associates that are no
longer consolidated as a result of the introduction of
IFRS 11 from reporting year 2014; the recognition of the
cumulative financing preference shares B (and related
financing expenses) as equity rather than borrowed
capital; the exclusion of so-called non-recourse PFI
project financing (and related financing expenses and
project results); and finally, with respect to EBITDA
certain expenses cannot be characterised as ‘non-operational’, including value adjustments in land holdings,
reorganisation costs and adjustments related to pension
valuations. In view of this, Heijmans has taken the
underlying operational result plus depreciation and
amortisation as the basis for the calculation below.
This resulted in the following breakdown as at 31
December 2017:

Heijmans has agreed various sureties with the banks. This
includes a right of lien on the bank accounts (100%),
intellectual property rights, receivables, materials, a right
of lien on the revenue from the sale of the divested
companies, as well as a first right of mortgage on land
holdings with a total carrying amount of around € 75
million. The facilities were subject to an interest rate of 4%
as of year-end 2017, with a reduced rate coming into
effect the moment Heijmans realises a further reduction
of the facility.
As a result of the implementation of IFRS 11, most project
financing facilities for projects executed in cooperation
with third parties are no longer recognised separately in
the consolidated statement of financial position. They are
instead recognised under the item associates /financial
assets.
The remaining financing facilities are a number of
financial leases and a current account facility.

At year-end 2017, Heijmans’ order book stood at a total
of € 1,898 million, comparable to the level at year-end
2016 (€ 1,863 million, excluding discontinued operations). The largest incoming orders were the Wintrack II
and Zuidasdok projects, which Heijmans acquired in
early 2017. The Property Development and Residential
Building order book was higher as a result of the
acquisition of a number of excellent projects. Heijmans’
withdrawal from the RIVM project was one of the
reasons for the decline in the order book at NonResidential. The impact of the loss of revenue from the

Annual Report 2017 - Heijmans

RIVM project amounted to more than € 150 million in
the order book. In addition to this, the selective order
intake on the basis of margin-over-volume principle was
also a factor in the decline. At year-end 2017, approximately 60% of the revenue forecast for 2018 was already
in the order book (year-end 2017: 61%). The order book at
year-end 2017 and the comparative figures for 30 June
2017 and 31 December 2016 can be broken down as

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Last year was a transition year marked by a recovery in
profitability, the continued implementation of Heijmans’
revised strategy and the realisation of the planned debt
reduction, as well as the repositioning of the Dutch core
business. Heijmans made progress on all these aspects
last year. Due to the combination of profit recovery and
the policy aimed at de-risking the company – largely by
limiting the potential impact of individual project results
via an improved balance in the types of project –
Heijmans has laid a solid foundation for the future. The
order book is well filled. The quality of the order book
improved steadily over the course of 2017, with
contracts that are in line with our strategic parameters.
Heijmans’ key goal for 2018 remains a continued
recovery in profitability.

Operational
report
Property Development and Residential Building
As in 2016, last year the market was marked by growing demand for homes, especially in
the four largest cities and their surrounding regions. House prices (including purchasing
costs payable by vendor) increased once again in 2017. The market was characterised by a
rapid turnaround on the back of economic developments. The growth in the number of
households and the growth of cities and their peripheries were even more marked last year.
We will see a structural shortage in homes in the coming years, as a result of the expected
increase of more than 1 million households between now and 2030. The majority of these
homes will have to be built in inner city areas and in newly-developed areas around the
cities. This will put considerable pressure on inner city areas: the space available is declining,
which will lead to continued urban densification. The response to this complex issue will
require a great deal of creativity, as developing these types of locations will require an
integrated approach to the inner-city challenge, with a combination of residential, non-residential, infrastructure development, air quality and green area development. Heijmans is
responding to that development and deploying its integrated strengths in area developments such as Haga in The Hague, Nieuw Kralingen in Rotterdam, Kanaleneiland in Utrecht
and Sloterdijk Centrum in Amsterdam.
The realisation of the Heijmans Woonconcept (Huismerk and Wenswonen) has shown that
long-term partnerships with co-makers and reaching clear, reciprocal agreements have
resulted in a sustained ability to respond to demand. In the year under review, Heijmans
began production on more than 550 homes based on the Woonconcept and we expect this
number to increase to around 1,000 in 2018. Production has not come to a standstill despite
the considerable pressure on the availability of materials and capacity in the chain.
Flexibility in planning capacity in both construction and property development also creates
the opportunity to combine projects and optimise processes.

PROFILE & STRATEGY

REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD

CORPORATE GOVERANCE

The increasing digitalisation in residential environments
is another significant development. The use of data and
sensor technology makes it possible to gain more
insight into both residential needs and how homes are
used. This in turn enables the addition of functionalities
to the residential environment in the fields of comfort,
safety and energy consumption, as well as additional
services. Heijmans is responding to this trend with its
‘Slim Wonen’ (‘Smart Living’) concept, which is now a
standard component of every new-build owner-occupier
house that Heijmans builds. At the end of 2017,
Heijmans had delivered the 1,000th home built in line
with this concept.
Heijmans has opted for a strategy of product optimisation combined with improvements to the sales process.
To this end, the company has taken stock of how
customers (want to) experience the process and product
and how Heijmans can respond to this (the so-called
customer journey). The company also organised a
number of training courses to improve the customer
experience and will continue to make further improvements to both processes and systems. The average
customer rating for a Heijmans home, measured by the
external organisation SKB (Stichting Klantgericht
Bouwen), was 7.17 in 2017 (on a scale of 10) and was
therefore comparable to the peer group. This figure was
6.69 in 2016. Heijmans’ ambition and strategy is to
translate these insights into the customer experience
into a continued improvement in this rating in the
future. Remaining issues that require attention are: zero
snagging items, response time, problem-solving
potential and improving services and customer contacts
at specific moments in the sales process. Heijmans has
noted that customers increasingly take into account the
total monthly expenditure - including costs such as
energy and the measures to reduce these costs - in the
purchase of a new home. Heijmans also expects to see
increasing digitalisation in the customer journey, giving
customers, who wish to do so, the opportunity to
explore, choose and eventually buy their home online.
In addition to the increase in house prices (including
purchasing costs payable by vendor), the land prices
and the costs of developing and building homes are also
on the rise on a nationwide basis. The demand for prefab
shell homes, piles and roofs increased strongly in 2017
and this underlined the previously noted need to serve
the market on the basis of partnerships with suppliers.
The recovering economy has also led to an increase in
demand for commercial properties. These are primarily
inner-city locations and buildings with a high level of

58

Annual Report 2017 - Heijmans

APPENDICES

mixed functionalities, such as apartment buildings with
a commercial ground floor or other combinations of
residential, commercial and leisure spaces. Based on the
need to make existing office buildings more sustainable,
Heijmans expects to see an increase in renovation as
well as transformation and/or demolition/new-build
contracts. In 2017, Heijmans therefore started preparations that will enable it to actively seize opportunities on
the commercial property front that arise from transformation and sustainability contracts from 2018 onwards.
In addition, Heijmans is setting up a section for multi-functional high-rise residential construction within the
Building & Technology business area, in order to focus
the construction organisation on this development.
The growth in the market offers opportunities for the
continued development of the existing land holdings
portfolio to meet growing demand and by doing so
reduce capital requirements. At the same time, it also
means Heijmans needs to devote attention to the
acquisition of new land holdings to meet growing
demand in the future. Heijmans is selective on this front
and focuses on positions in economically strong regions
with a development horizon of less than five years.
Residential Building has a strategy of controlled growth
and the selective acquisition of contracts, which come
largely from Property Development, as well as via its
own acquisition pipeline. This approach means that
Residential Building can maintain a high level of quality
and margins, even while there is growing pressure on
capacity and prices in the building chain.
In line with the Heijmans business model, Property
Development and Residential Building are centrally
organised and managed business areas that cooperate
closely in serving the market. The know-how and
expertise in area development remains a key driver for
the development of the organisation’s project portfolio
and acquisition strength. The acquisition capabilities of
Property Development extend way beyond residential
building, as a result of urban densification and innercity contracts that are almost by definition integrated
multi-functional projects.
Residential Building saw a marked turnaround in the
year under review. The market saw strong growth, which
meant we had to devote attention to controlled growth
and the underlying procurement and capacity planning.
However, no projects were brought to a standstill despite
the strong market growth and resultant demand for
capacity. The co-makership Heijmans aims for based on
its procurement policy is paying off particularly well in

PROFILE & STRATEGY

REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD

CORPORATE GOVERANCE

this market. Heijmans increasingly collaborates with
permanent partners and has deliberately reduced the
number of its suppliers. Thanks to the strong collaboration between Property Development and Residential
Building, there is clear oversight of project schedules
and reciprocal engagement at an early stage, which
enables Heijmans to anticipate market developments
and the required operational process. Increasing
sustainability also remains a key focal point, and a
neighbourhood-focused approach is gaining ground on
this front. Other issues such as energy supply also play
a role in this. This energy supply challenge also remains
important at product level, in terms of design, concept
and standardisation. Heijmans is also responding to the
major challenge of making existing housing stocks more
sustainable through renovations, which also lead to
considerable improvement in the living comfort of these
homes.
These areas of expertise, operating methods and
organisation put Heijmans in an excellent position in
the growing housing market, which translates into the
acquisition of interesting new projects and healthy
progress in ongoing projects. For instance, in the year
under review, Heijmans acquired contracts for the
development of 125 homes in Leidsche Rijn Centrum in
Utrecht, and for 150 homes and commercial spaces as
part of the inner city transformation of SloterdijkCentrum in Amsterdam. Heijmans also won a contract
from real estate investor Vesteda for the development
and realisation of more than 370 homes in various
municipalities in the Netherlands. And the realisation of
the Bananenstraat in the Katendrecht neighbourhood in
Rotterdam, the Gasthuiskwartier area development
project in Den Bosch and the Noorderhaven project in
Zutphen all saw solid progress last year. On the
renovations front, Heijmans is improving the sustainability of 1,000 homes for housing corporation Lefier in
Groningen over the next two years. In Amsterdam,
Heijmans delivered the Wiener & Co inner-city area
development project, which received the Zuiderkerkprijs
award for the best residential building in 2017.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

APPENDICES

Property Development is reaping the benefits of the
strong growth in the housing market, both in the form of
an increase in the number of homes sold and in the
increase in house prices (including purchasing costs
payable by vendor). Heijmans sold 2,192 homes in 2017
(2016: 1,962), with 1,394 (64%) of these sold to private
buyers and 798 (36%) sold to investors (2016: 1,019
homes / 52% to private buyers and 943 homes / 48% to
investors). The increase in the value of homes is visible in
the average price (including purchasing costs payable by
vendor) of the homes sold to private buyers. This
increased to € 299,000 in 2017 (2016: € 243,000.
Property Development recorded revenue of € 391 million
in 2017 (2016: € 332 million), while underlying EBITDA
was € 20 million (2016: € 15 million). The order book
stood at € 420 million at year-end 2017.
The stock of strategic land holdings increased to € 150
million, from € 147 million. Unconditional commitments,
which will result in future property acquisitions, declined
to € 73 million in 2017 (2016: € 93 million). Conditional
commitments, which may lead to future property
acquisitions, declined to € 114 million (2016: € 146
million). The majority of these conditional commitments
will have only a limited cash impact upon materialisation. These are primarily commitments to acquire land
once a building permit has been granted and/or a certain
sales percentage has been achieved. The growth in the
market means there is an opportunity to develop
positions in the existing land holdings portfolio to meet
demand, while at the same time reducing capital
requirements.

on the basis of its procurement policy is paying off

Residential Building is looking to maintain a selective

as well as renovation and the realisation of new functionalities. After all, sensors can show how buildings are being
used, where and when cleaning and other forms of
maintenance are needed and which functionalities could
be introduced to anticipate future user needs. This focus
on data is a key spearhead for Non-Residential. BeSense
won the 2017 European Cleaning & Hygiene Award in the
category ‘Ground-breaking Innovations’ and this
underlined the strategic value of the product when it
comes to smart and efficient building management.

Non-Residential
The performance of the Non-Residential business area
was disappointing in 2017. In the year under review,
Heijmans changed and renewed the management of the
organisation considerably, reassessed projects, improved
the internal information systems and took measures to
tighten the tender and acquisition process. Partly as a
result of our margin-over-volume policy, revenue declined
to € 240 million last year (2016: € 315 million). The
decision to withdraw from the RIVM project consortium
also affected revenue, the result and the order book.
Non-Residential has tightened its focus and is now
targeting the healthcare (cure) market, education (college
and university buildings) sector, commercial property for
private parties and (semi) public sector organisations,
industry, data centres, leisure and multi-functional
high-rise residential buildings. The conservative acquisition policy with respect to new-build projects is related to
the question of whether the preconditions outlined in the
tender request are realistic and offer Heijmans the
opportunity to realise a margin in line with its risk profile.
In addition, Non-Residential’s Services business unit
recorded a solid performance in the field of maintenance
and management, with annual revenue of € 171 million.
The optimisation of the financial processes has given
Heijmans clear insight into current schedules, project
processes and cash flow, which has reduced the chance of
surprises in projects. The implementation of SAP
- launched in 2016 and completed in 2017 – has played a
crucial role in this.
Aside from these internal measures, Non-Residential has
also restructured the commercial process on the basis of
the previously outlined market analysis, but also by
developing concepts and added value. This enables
Non-Residential to operate more pro-actively in the
market, an approach aided by creative strength and close
collaboration with clients. The BeSense product is an
example of this development. This remote sensor system
enables users to respond quickly to accommodation
issues on both the maintenance and management fronts,

60

Annual Report 2017 - Heijmans

The market for non-residential new-build projects showed
the first signs of recovery in the year under review.
Although we saw an increase in volumes in the tender
stages throughout a large part of the year, there were no
real signs of a recovery in price levels. Principals in the
non-residential market are increasingly aware that price
setting has to go hand in hand with the complexity of
projects and the impact on the procurement side as a
result of economic recovery. Yet the budgets for new-build
projects are still frequently inadequate. Non-Residential
therefore continues to be selective in terms of the
acquisition of projects. The revenue of the Services
business unit remained more or less unchanged from the
previous year in 2017. Here too, Non-Residential is
selective in its acquisition of new contracts and deliberately opting for larger maintenance contracts - with the
opportunity for follow-up contracts - often from existing
clients, rather than a portfolio of numerous small, one-off
contracts. Examples of the former are the maintenance
and management at Schiphol, the Meander Medical
Centre in Amersfoort, the government building Turfmarkt
147 in The Hague and the buildings at Eindhoven
Technical University.
The Services business unit is focusing on developing
strong customer relationships, which means NonResidential is engaged with its clients more frequently
and for longer periods of time and can therefore use its
in-depth knowledge of its clients’ business processes to
help them focus on their core business. Now that the
market is recovering, it will be possible to realise interesting projects with a recurring character in the construction
team. Products like BeSense also support this client
strategy and are leading to interesting new requests on
the maintenance and management optimisation front.
Heijmans decided to withdraw from the RIVM projects
and transferred its share in the consortium to Strukton.
This was in line with the strategy aimed at reducing the
impact of a number of specific projects as quickly as
possible in 2017, the year of transition. While a financial
and technical solution for the project was found,

PROFILE & STRATEGY

REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD

CORPORATE GOVERANCE

Heijmans nonetheless decided that the transfer of its
share in the project was the best way to operate in line
with this strategy. The permissions required from project
financiers and principals have since been received. As a
result of this decision, Heijmans has taken a one-off loss
of € 3.5 million and will no longer play a role in the
execution and exploitation of this PPP project.
In early 2018, Heijmans delivered the new swimming
centre in Hart van Zuid, which is part of the ‘Hart van Zuid’
area development in Rotterdam. The realisation of this
swimming pool involved the transformation of an office
building. Heijmans is also working on the renovations of
the Ahoy events and conference centre as part of the Hart
van Zuid development. In addition, in 2017 Heijmans won
the contract for the realisation of two new KLM training
centres at Schiphol. And in the spring of 2017, Heijmans
delivered the Eurojust building in The Hague. Eurojust is
active in the fight against international crime and
terrorism.

The results of Non-Residential lagged in 2017, partly
because revenue was significantly lower last year at
€ 240 million, compared with the previous year
(2016: € 315 million). Underlying EBITDA amounted to
€ 6 million negative (2016: € 14 million negative).
Although the market for non-residential new-build
showed an increase in volumes, there was no real
recovery in price levels. This decline was due to a
tightened commercial focus and a strict acquisition
policy when it comes to new-build projects and the
related under-coverage of general overheads. The
decision to withdraw from the consortium for the RIVM
project also had an impact on revenue, the result and
the order book. This decision had an impact of more
than €150 million on the order book, which stood at €
589 million at year-end 2017.

Infra
In 2016, the Infra business area recorded a strongly
negative operating result due to a number of high-risk
projects that had a significant downward impact on the
result. These strongly negative developments led to a

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

APPENDICES

strategic focus on the reduction of risks (de-risking) and
getting results back on track in 2017. In early 2017,
Heijmans appointed a Chief Risk Officer to supervise
operating and project risks and develop and implement
risk management across the board at Infra. We also
adapted the project risk categorisation. This means that in
addition to revenue/volume, we also include other aspects
such as contract risks and assess the complexity in the
selective acquisition of projects. Heijmans has made a
number of strategic choices in terms of market focus and
acquisition, such as the emphasis on line infrastructure,
the creation of an improved balance in the revenue mix
between large projects on the one hand and regional
projects, asset management and specialisms on the other.
As part of Heijmans’ ‘Focus, Discipline, Excellence’
strategy, Heijmans adjusted the Infra organisation in
2017, based on the guiding principles of ownership, focus
on results and collaboration. The regional businesses are
managed locally, while specialist know-how is organised
centrally and made available across the entire organisation. Heijmans’ centralised and integrated management
is aimed at maintaining the added value and integrated
nature of the business units. In 2017, the company also
worked on risk-aware entrepreneurship to strengthen the
regional operations. With a view to future-proofing the
company, Heijmans has developed an approach to the
development of new products based on the principles of
the circular economy and sustainability, such as the
development of sustainable concrete and asphalt.
In the process of this shift, we also devoted attention to
corporate culture and core values as crucial factors in the
success of the strategy. The ‘IK!’ corporate culture
programme formed an integral part of all internal
communications and therefore reached all employees. By
actively promoting the related principles and values, the
company is constantly working on its corporate culture.
Investments in people, expertise, training and the right
skills remain a priority on this front.
Progress settlement high-risk projects
In the first quarter of 2017, the settlement of a number of
high-risk projects continued to demand the organisation’s
attention, but the impact of these projects was reduced.
This trend continued throughout the year. Heijmans
reached definitive agreement on the N23 Westfrisiaweg
project, where work is now up and running after the
restart of the project. With respect to the Wilhelmina locks
project, Heijmans is still awaiting the definitive ruling of

delivery of the tunnel to the Dutch Ministry of Public
Works and Water Management (delivery for use), which is
scheduled for the end of June 2018.
Large projects won by Infra in 2017 included the design
and realisation of the Zuidasdok in Amsterdam (Heijmans
has a 15% share in the consortium) and the contract for
the realisation of the new high-voltage network Wintrack
II in partnership with Europoles (Heijmans share 60%).
In 2017, Heijmans improved the balance in revenue
between large integrated projects and regional projects,
maintenance and specialist works. For instance, Heijmans
signed the alliance contract for the dyke reinforcement
project Gorinchem Waardenburg and announced it will
execute a new project with energy-generating noise
barriers near the A50 in Uden: Solar Highways. In the
spring, we realised the large-scale maintenance on the
Kaagbaan runway at Schiphol airport, in which we
combined a wide range of different activities to complete
the project in just over nine weeks. In the summer,
Heijmans built a heat-transport pipeline in the
Amsterdam Oostelijk Havengebied area for energy
company Nuon, with the purpose of providing existing
and future homes in the area with residual heat from the
electricity plant in Diemen. Heijmans also won the
contract for the construction of the Zilverbaan in
Veldhoven, the new western access route to the future
connection to the A67 motorway.

People and
Organisation
People are the heart of the organisation. The Heijmans organisation came under immense
pressure in late 2016 and in the year under review. This made debt reduction and safeguarding the continuity of the company our top priorities. As a result, Heijmans decided to
make drastic changes in a short space of time, which demanded a huge commitment from
the company’s employees. Those same employees showed enormous engagement and
dedication and, last year, together we managed to take a number of major steps that
yielded significant results. The positive impact of these steps has given our employees a
new esprit and confidence. At the same time, the construction industry is facing growing
shortages on the labour market, while developments on the social front are demanding
creativity, experience and expertise. These developments are making human capital more
important than ever. Heijmans aims to be an employer of choice, putting it in a position to
attract and retain high-quality employees. Heijmans is looking to differentiate itself by
offering a long-term challenge (a career), with room for growth and professional and
personal development. Heijmans also wants to offer its employees a safe and healthy
workplace and this is one of our key strategic priorities. Heijmans’ commitment as an
employer, the innovative projects we win and the integrated nature of the services we offer
are key factors in being an attractive employer. Heijmans uses this strategy to respond to
developments on the work front and the sector as a whole, and to respond to developments in the health and work experience of our (future) employees.
Trends and developments
The year under review was marked by a significant turnaround as a result of the economic
recovery and growth in the housing market. The technical sector is proving to be a sector
with more than its fair share of professionals in short supply, according to research from
the Dutch Employment Insurance Agency UVW. This is also very much visible in the
construction sector, which is one of the main technical sectors in the Netherlands. While
the economic crisis of a few years back led to a policy largely driven by efficiency considerations, in 2017 we saw the creation of room to offer new perspectives. Shortages in

experienced and qualified technical staff increased
significantly, with project managers, BIM specialists,
work planners, site managers and calculators in
particularly high demand in the current market. This
shortage of personnel in the manufacturing industry in
general will also continue to grow in the coming years,
and this will require extra attention from Heijmans and
from broader society as a whole. Shortages in the labour
market had an impact on Heijmans’ HR policy in 2017,
especially in the second half of the year. In consultation
with all business areas, we looked at the development in
demand and hired several recruiters. The continued
ageing of the population will result in an outflow of
large groups of experienced professionals in the years
ahead, which will exacerbate the impact of this shift.
Despite these developments, Heijmans was able to meet
the demand from the organisation and fill vacancies in
2017.
In addition to shortages in the labour market, Heijmans
has also noted that labour is becoming increasingly
flexible. This means not only that the time and place of
work is shifting and becoming more flexible, but it is
also creating an increasing demand for a new kind of
leadership. This new style of leadership is characterised
by the connection with and between employees, the
need to devote attention to their development and
personal motivation and circumstances. Shortages in
the labour market mean it is increasingly important to
respond to this need in a way that employees recognise
and appreciate.

Culture and core values
In 2016, Heijmans launched the ‘IK!’ programme aimed at
actively promoting certain core values and kinds of
behaviour. This programme is a logical translation of the
corporate strategy into conduct and attitude, driven by
the core values of ownership, result-orientation and
collaboration. Attention to culture and conduct is crucial,
especially in a project organisation like Heijmans, where
the uniformity of work on projects, the impact of details
and the actions of every individual can all have a major
impact. This awareness has increased in recent years and
as a result promoting our core values has become more of
a priority. The choice of ‘IK!’ as the umbrella concept
shows that every success, every change and every
improvement starts with you: what can you do, where can
you improve and where can you have an impact? ‘IK!’ is
also a good fit with the safety programme ’GO!’, which is
also based on the same consistent principle. In addition to
risk awareness, Heijmans also actively targeted contract
awareness. Both have an immense value in a project
organisation in which consistency is important and risks

can be considerable. In the past year, the various business
areas developed the IK! programme in more detail and
implemented the programme in their respective organisations. This has resulted in the following actions:
In Non-Residential, the core values have been linked to a
strategic path. The strategy and core values were
introduced and discussed during a road show at all offices
and business units. The company has appointed various
coaches/ambassadors in the organisation, who initiate a
dialogue on the subject and actively discuss the content.
The company also published a regular newsletter, and
highlighted the core values and acceptable behaviour in
concrete stories and practical examples that are shared
within the business area via a news app. This enables us
to put the programme into practice in a low threshold
and consistent manner. In addition, in the spring of 2017
we conducted an engagement scan among all employees
of Non-Residential to gauge the employees’ engagement
with the company.
The survey revealed the following areas of improvement:
improved reciprocal know-how exchange, personal
attention, leadership focused on people and reducing the
divide between ‘outside’ and ‘inside’. At Property
Development, we also set up a core team of ambassadors
to further develop and embed the programme in the
organisation. At Infra, IK! has been linked to a strategic
process and both ‘IK!’ and the strategic process have been
highlighted in all communications in the organisation:
via a road show, in personal letters, in a strategy booklet
and by giving all managers a proactive role in promoting
the relevant values. We also conducted an employee
survey at Infra in 2017. This revealed the following areas
of improvement: work pressure, personal development,
management, cooperation and communications. It is
hardly surprising that areas where the organisation has
come under significant pressure in recent years are also
those that are highlighted as potential areas of improvement in an employee engagement survey. These have
since been included in the culture programme at Infra
and will require extra attention in the coming period.

Learning organisation
The concept of the learning organisation remains a key
priority for Heijmans, which can be seen in training
programmes, job rotation and the corporate culture.
Learning is also expressed in terms of encouraging
employees to point out areas for improvement and
making those the subject of an ongoing dialogue. The
organisation is gaining in know-how and aims for
increasingly know-how intensive profiles at every level
of the organisation. That also increases the importance

PROFILE & STRATEGY

REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD

CORPORATE GOVERANCE

of developing and raising the quality of that know-how.
This is even more important given that the market is
demanding ever-increasing levels of know-how, creativity and experience to respond to and overcome social
challenges. Heijmans stresses the importance of
individual, practical know-how and experience in the
training of its employees. We share and discuss best
practices and internal training courses include discussion of current, Heijmans-related issues. During the
‘trade days’, which are part of the training package, the
company combined efforts with skilled workers to assess
their training and education needs. This raised 90
points, which have been addressed and discussed in
toolbox meetings, works instructions and via the quality
sheets. In the past year, Heijmans organised training for
employees who use a company PC in the field of cyber
security and the correct handling of data and hardware.
Know-how intensity
Know-how intensity as a KPI is the result of a number of
developments in the construction industry that Heijmans
focuses on indirectly. Projects are becoming more
complex and more integrated. Building in inner-city
areas, transformations and high-rise construction are all
examples of projects that require a high level of knowhow. At the same time, these are also the type of projects
Heijmans is looking to acquire, and the kind of projects
the company can use to create its differentiating potential
in the market. Contracts are becoming ever more complex
and new forms of collaboration are also placing new
demands on the abilities of employees. Heijmans is also
working on numerous concepts and innovative developments. One key development is the ongoing digitalisation
in both operations and product upgrades. This requires a
new set of competencies. The combination of the above
has resulted in the recruitment of people in positions that
require relatively high levels of education or specialist
knowledge, which means Heijmans is becoming a more
know-how intensive company.
Know-how intensity is measured by dividing all positions
into four academic categories: LBO/VMBO (pre-vocational),
MBO (vocational), HBO (applied sciences) and WO
(university). This shows that the organisation has become
more know-how intensive since 2016.

In 2017, the percentage of employees with an MBO 3
level education declined slightly to 8% of the total
workforce (2016: 9%). The percentage of employees with
an MBO 3 or 4 level education remained the same. The
percentage of employees with a HBO level education
increased slightly to 44% of the total workforce in 2017,
from 43% in 2016. The percentage of employees with a
university degree (WO) remained the same.
Talent development
Heijmans taps into the potential of the various groups
within the organisation through talent development
programmes. The management development programme
targets the senior and middle management levels of the
company, the young potential programme targets young
employees and trainees, while the professional programme focuses on technical and specialist positions.
Heijmans uses its management development programme
to direct the development of senior management. The
company aims to develop at least 70% of its succession
potential from in-house personnel.

Diversity
Diversity remains important, also in terms of team
performance and accountability for results. This extends
beyond the division of men and women, as it also
pertains to cultural diversity and diversity in terms of
personal profiles. Heijmans therefore conducted an
analysis on the basis of the Management Drives method
in its numerous project and management teams. The
purpose of this analysis was to arrive at diverse teams in
which different profiles complement and stimulate each
other. Aside from that profile, each vacancy is assessed in
terms of whether a man or a woman would be preferable
in that position. The proportion of women in senior
management positions increased to 12.5% across the
entire organisation last year. This percentage is highest at
Property Development and in the staff departments.
There are no women in the Executive Board, while the
Supervisory Board has one female member. Through
work placement, trainee programmes, the annual master
class and recruitment, Heijmans can see growing
numbers of young women entering technical education
and subsequently choosing technical jobs. This offers
Heijmans the opportunity to increase the diversity in the
organisation in terms of the proportion of men to women.

this programme in 2013 and it is headed by a programme
manager and a programme team that comprises a mix of
line managers (a reflection of the work areas), procurement,
quality and safety managers. The programme team holds a
strategy meeting once a year to evaluate the programme
and the objectives and translate these into a programme for
the year ahead. The programme manager regularly reports
to the Executive Board.

Actions 2017

The Safety programme is also actively promoted by 45
‘GO!’ coaches. They actively promote the rules of safety-related conduct and attitude and enter into a dialogue with
employees. They support their peer (senior) site managers
and coach their colleagues in the field of safety. They also
raise safety awareness through targeted training courses
and toolbox meetings. The coaches encourage safe
procedures on their ‘own’ building sites and take
individual and collective actions to make safety a topic of
discussion and to raise the level of safety at every level of
the organisation. The GO! coaches have all followed a
5.5-day training course geared to coaching skills and soft
(social) skills. Heijmans has also taken steps to have all
managers obtain SCC (SHE (Safety, Health and the
Environment) Checklist Contractors) certification as
another way of raising safety awareness.

• In 2016, Heijmans initiated an investigation into the
effectiveness of toolbox meetings, which are often used
to highlight safety issues. One of the measures this has
resulted in is the training of site managers, so they can
hold interactive toolbox meetings with the building site
employees. Heijmans provided these training courses in
2017. Thanks to the new, interactive nature of the
meetings, the subject tends to make a stronger and
more lasting impression on the building site employees
who take part.

The safety programme is based on three pillars. The first
is a change of attitude and behaviour when it comes to
safety. The second is a uniform safety level and a uniform
and shared perception of safety within Heijmans. The
third principle is collaboration on safety in the construction chain.
The programme has been running for more than four
years now and there has been a clear change in culture
and behaviour and we have made major progress, but we
still have a long way to go to realise these goals. The
company has therefore decided that, in addition to the
changes we have already realised, we need additional
drastic and structural measures to take us even closer to
the targets we have set. Heijmans has extended the
scope of the programme through 2020.
Targets and actions of the safety programme
2013-2020
The programme has the following goals: no accidents
resulting in death or permanent injury, the safest
construction company in the Netherlands (IF<1) in 2020,
a sustainable change of culture with respect to safety and
a proactive attitude towards the safety of employees. We
plan to achieve this by encouraging a change of attitude
and behaviour, uniform safety requirements and
collaboration aimed at safety in the construction chain.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Annual Report 2017 - Heijmans

Heijmans continues to dedicate considerable attention
and energy to attitude and behaviour rules with respect
to safety, to make sure the shift we have started in terms
of both attitude and actions is embedded in the organisation. Heijmans has initiated a range of efforts to continue
to draw attention to these rules and encourage compliance with same.

• In 2017, members of the senior management team once
again made working visits in the context of the GO!
programme. These so-called workplace inspections
increase their visibility and engagement in terms of
safety at the building site. The senior management
(including managers from corporate staff departments)
take to the building sites in pairs, to enter into a
dialogue about safety on the spot.
• Online and digital communications
The GO! app is an online platform used to share
important information about safety and the safety
programme, such as the health, safety, welfare and
environment guide, practical ‘handles’ and the content
of toolboxes. Employees can also use the app to report
unsafe situations at work, draw their colleagues’
attention to such situations and learn from same. In
June, the 3000th GO! app report was filed. More than
3,700 reports have been filed since the introduction of
the GO! app in 2014.
• In the past year, Heijmans digitalised the workplace
instructions (WPI) and integrated it in the GO! app. This
makes it possible to register all findings and photographs of an inspection during a site visit immediately.
In 2017, we conducted more than 8,500 electronic site
inspections. The average number of questions per site
inspection covers around 15 to 16 items. These are
immediately collected and analysed using the systems
behind the GO! app, making it possible to address any
issues quickly and translate these into improvement
measures.

PROFILE & STRATEGY

REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD

CORPORATE GOVERANCE

• All Heijmans employees receive a monthly newsletter
(‘update in de keet’ or site cabin update) and these too
are part of the GO! App. All this information is freely
accessible at no charge to everyone in the building
chain, including subcontractors, suppliers and customers. Other building companies have also adopted the
system and structure of the GO! App. This way, safety
know-how and the approach to safety are distributed
across the sector via the Governance Code Safety in the
Building Sector and the Safety taskforce of industry
organisation Bouwend Nederland.
• Safety introduction movie
In 2016, Heijmans made the GO! safety introduction
film, as a uniform information medium for all visitors
and employees at Heijmans buildings sites. The safety
introduction film was introduced in the business areas
Residential Building and Non-Residential in 2017,
followed by Infra in Q1 2018.
• Hand-outs and safety instructions
In 2015, the company started the implementation of
integrated safety in the design stages of projects, by
drawing up a design schedule. In 2017, we trained a
number of design and development managers,
developers and design leaders in the organisation and
presentation of a safety design session. Also in 2017,
Heijmans produced various hand-outs / instruction
leaflets of comprehensive safety themes for developers,
designers and construction engineers.
• Introduction new employees
Every new employee at Heijmans takes part in an
introduction day. GO! is an important part of that day.
New employees discuss safety themes together and
think about what they could do to improve safety. In
2017, Heijmans held six introduction days attended by
a total of 257 new employees.
• Safety meetings Procurement
In 2017, Heijmans invited a group of selected strategic
suppliers/subcontractors to attend two safety sessions.
During these sessions, Heijmans and its partners
discussed safety issues and developed solutions
together using the Kaizen method of continuous
incremental improvements. We have made these safety
meetings a structural part of our drive to improve safety
standards.

accidents is in line with Heijmans’ own ambitions.
• Governance Code Safety
In early January 2014, Heijmans and 14 other companies
and organisations signed the Safety in Construction
Governance Code. By signing the code, the companies and
organisations committed to increasing safety in the sector
with a joint policy aimed at a safe working and living
environment, maximum safety awareness and attitude,
sound collaboration and chain integration. In 2016, a CEO
vanguard group was set up in which Heijmans is represented. The company is heading the development of a uniform
reporting app for the construction sector and is also
represented in the safeguard committee for the generic
gate instructions. At the end of 2017, the parties to this
initiative signed the so-called generic gate instruction (GPI)’.
Under this initiative, project employees will follow a generic
safety training course that will eventually replace all
project and company-specific gate instructions in the
construction sector. The Foundation Cooperation for Safety
(SSVV), which provides training courses for companies
involved in high-risk activities, is collaborating in this effort.

Safety figures
The trend in accident index figures for Heijmans in the
Netherlands is shown in the table below. The figures are
based on the number of accidents resulting in absenteeism among our own personnel (including temporary
personnel) in relation to the number of hours worked.
In 2017, we registered 77 accidents among our own and
temporary personnel and those of subcontractors. Unlike
in previous years, the IF figure for Heijmans in the
Netherlands also includes joint works from 1 January
2017. Heijmans’ share in the joint work, in percentages, is
also the company’s proportional share in the accidents
resulting in absenteeism. The calculation does not make
a distinction between the employees of the partners
involved in the joint work.

REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD

CORPORATE GOVERANCE

In 2017, there was one fatal accident. Heijmans is deeply
saddened by this accident and has expressed its condolences to the family of the victim. The internal accident
investigation of the fatal accident is likely to be finalised
in the first quarter of 2018 and the conclusions and
recommendations will subsequently be shared internally
and externally.

Health
Heijmans’ own Health and Safety Centre advises, guides
and supports managers to safeguard the employability
and availability and therefore the productivity of
employees. The Health and Safety Centre also handles
the prevention of absenteeism and contributes to the
optimisation of working conditions. This safeguards and
promotes the employees’ long-term employability and
availability for work. The starting point is the employee
and how they can be employed despite their health
issues. Heijmans immediately refers employees with
health complaints to the network of specialists it has
developed. In addition to speed, this also has a beneficial
effect on absenteeism. However, absenteeism increased in
the year under review, partly due to cases of long-term
sick leave. Among office staff, this generally involves
stress-related issues. Partly in response to this, the Health
and Safety Centre organised stress management
workshops across the entire company. These workshops
revolved around picking up stress signals and providing
insight into the best way to respond to those signals.
All Heijmans employees can make use of a periodic
medical examination by the Dutch Health and Safety
Centre (De Arbodienst). Heijmans supports subsequent
interventions resulting from these medical examinations,
such as workplace visits, ergonomic assessments and
vitality interviews.

OECD Directives
Heijmans acknowledges the various points set out in the
OECD guidelines, and acts in accordance with them. The
company is subject to audits by certifying bodies and
auditors in this context. We report publicly on our activity
on this front in our integrated annual report (GRI4), at the
General Meeting of Shareholders, on the company
website and via other channels. Our integrity policy, HR
policy and sustainable procurement policy are examples
of explicitly described elements of our approach to health
and safety.

Absenteeism
Heijmans targets an absenteeism percentage of less
than 4%. Absenteeism in the Netherlands as a whole
increased to 4.21% in 2017 (2016: 3.71%). The rapidly
growing market, demand for skilled employees and
older people staying in the workforce for longer goes
hand in hand with changes and increased work pressure.
This is reflected in the slight increase of 0.5% since 2016.
The frequency of absenteeism declined while the
duration of same increased slightly. The difference in
absenteeism percentages between direct (building site
related) and indirect employees is related to the
relatively high percentage of physical complaints and
absenteeism among building site employees. Heijmans
implemented the vitality programme ‘work enjoyment
and time management’ at Residential Building and
Property Development in 2017 and this has since been
made available to all business units. Heijmans actively
encouraged employees to participate in the sustainable
deployment analysis conducted by construction
industry knowledge and advice centre Volandis. In the
year under review, a total of 800 employees participated
in this analysis (including 433 covered by the collective
labour agreement for the metal industry and 367
covered by the collective labour agreement for the
construction industry).

Workforce figures
At year-end 2017, Heijmans had 4,554 employees
(year-end 2016: 4,716), broken down into age groups as
follows:

Vision
The construction industry has a unique opportunity to leave its mark on the future, as early
as the design and development of the built environment. Sustainable design, with a view to
alternative and decentralised energy generation, efficient use of energy, space and materials
and optimum comfort and user experience can all make a difference to the human environment. Heijmans wants sustainable design to contribute to reductions in CO2 emissions,
reduction in the amount of residual materials produced, waste separation and re-use after
disposal. Heijmans’ ultimate goal is to no longer extract energy, materials and space, but
instead add to the living environment, and by doing so create value.

Sustainability of organisation
Within the Heijmans organisation, a dedicated company-wide steering group discusses
aspects such as improvement, innovation, sustainability and safety in conjunction with each
other. The CEO of the company chairs this group. The steering group comprises representatives of the various business areas and procurement. The materiality analysis outlines a
number of aspects that affect and are important to Heijmans, including sustainability-related
aspects. Heijmans has introduced specialist teams in the business areas to take up those
aspects and issues. The line organisation is responsible for the specific operational choices
relating to these aspects. A company-wide CO2 desk combines all expertise on protocols and
tools in this area and provides support in the field of CO2 foot-printing and advice.

Sustainability policy
The company’s corporate sustainability vision was laid down in the ‘Spatial Contours of
Tomorrow’ vision (2013-2020). At the heart of this vision lies the ambition to create and add
value rather than destroy it. This applies to resources in the fields of energy, materials, space,
etc. This way Heijmans anticipates and responds to developments in energy transition, the
circular economy and the development of spatial quality. These ambitions also provide a
benchmark in the development of Heijmans’ innovation programmes. Based on this premise,
the sustainability policy has been divided into three areas:
1. continuing efforts to make Heijmans’ operations more sustainable;
2. greenification of the chain in cooperation with partners in the chain;
3. development of sustainable solutions in Heijmans’ overall product and services portfolio.

REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD

CORPORATE GOVERANCE

Increasing the sustainability of the operations
Active chain management and the procurement policy
are key drivers in Heijmans’ efforts to make its operations more sustainable. For instance, the company has
outlined an Energy Management Plan (EPM), which is
used to monitor the energy transition, energy efficiency
and energy savings of all buildings and materials. The
plan outlines actions for each object and each type of
resource, which are then implemented at a central level.
The company’s sustainable procurement policy
combines the activities in the chain. This applies to both
the collaboration partners and the products procured.
Heijmans’ sustainable procurement policy includes
explicit agreements with its larger partners, relating to
both sustainability and quality and safety. The company has set up an extensive training programme for
buyers and is working towards certification of the
continuing greenification of the procurement processes,
to initiate dialogue on this subject with its partners. The
chapter ‘strategy implementation’ provides insight into
the key steps taken in the field of procurement in the
year under review.

Footprint
The CO2 emission for scope 1 and 2 of Heijmans the
Netherlands was 51,088 tonnes in 2017, a decline of
2.8% compared with 52,563 tonnes in 2016.
Foot-printing objective 2016-2020
Heijmans aims to reduce CO2 emissions, in relation to
revenue, by at least 10% in four years’ time and uses 2016
as the benchmark year for both emissions and revenue in
this respect. The new Energy Management Plan (EMP) for
2017-2020, outlines additional measures to realise
further reductions in CO2 emissions during that period.
The focus is primarily on reducing emissions from
asphalt plants, projects and lease cars. In the EMP, we have
outlined a number of concrete measures that we will use
to reduce energy consumption and thus CO2 emissions
in the coming years. In 2017, the entire Heijmans
organisation was assessed against the standards of the
CO2 performance ladder, with the purpose of gaining a
‘CO2-aware certificate’ for the entire company. This
certificate will be issued in the course of 2018.
‘Greenification’ of the chain
At the end of 2017, we once again refined our sustainable procurement policy and communicated it to our
suppliers. A key change from the 2016 policy was the

definition of themes in the field of sustainable procurement and the analysis of same for each product group.
These themes are: management and organisation,
human rights, labour practices and the environment.
Based on the analysis, we define the relevance of each
theme and formulate and implement actions that we
can tackle with our partner. You can find an up-to-date
overview of relevant certificates and standards, as well as
the sustainable procurement policy underlining the
above, on the Heijmans website.

Developing sustainable solutions, a number of case
studies:
Carmel apartments in Beek
A co-operation of Heijmans and Van Wijnen is currently
renovating 384 apartments in the Carmel complex in
Beek for the ZOwonen housing corporation. The two
companies are making the 1960s apartments more
sustainable and energy efficient and the plan is to
eventually make them fully natural gas-free.
Collaboration Haarlem city council
In the year under review, Heijmans won a contract from
the Haarlem city council for a range of maintenance
projects over the next four years, varying from sewer
replacement to road construction. Together with a
number of partners, Heijmans will make an innovative
contribution to the circular economy and the city’s
sustainability goals. The collaboration adds routine and
increases transparency in the division of tasks between
the city council as overall manager and the selected
implementing partners. The council and the various
partners will also be able to make better use of each
other’s innovative capabilities.
Leidsche Rijn Centrum
Heijmans is developing and realising 125 homes for the
Utrecht city council adjacent to the central shopping area
in the Leidsche Rijn Centrum. The quality of the homes
and urban allure of the plan to be developed will
contribute to the urban living quality of Leidsche Rijn. The
project is also highly sustainable, with an energy
performance coefficient of -0.3, due to a number of
measures including PV cells on roofs and facades.
Central Waterway Waarderpolder
For the Haarlem city council, Heijmans has started
construction on a waterway that will make a significant

REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD

CORPORATE GOVERANCE

contribution to the sustainable and attractive design of
public spaces in the Waarderpolder development. As part
of the contract, Heijmans is also drilling, constructing
eight tunnels, and carrying out work to lay and remove
sewage systems. The company is also coordinating the
relocation of the various pipes and cables and replanting
around 77 trees and planting 63 new trees with the
necessary adjustments to the public infrastructure.
Greenification of 1,000 homes in Groningen
Heijmans won a contract from housing corporation Lefier
in Groningen to renovate almost 1,000 homes in the
space of two years. The objective is to improve comfort for
the residents and make the homes more sustainable and
more energy efficient. The corporation’s investment is in
line with its ‘Lefier pakt aan!’ programme and part of a € 1
billion investment the corporation is making in its
portfolio of homes over the next 10 years.
Zero Energy homes
In early November 2017, Heijmans and housing corporation BrabantWonen launched a pilot to renovate four
homes on Leuvenstraat in Den Bosch and turn them into
Zero Energy homes (ZEN) homes. These are the first social
housing homes in the city to be transformed into highly
sustainable homes. The pilot will test whether ZEN
renovation is feasible both technically and financially, so
more of the corporation’s homes can be transformed into
energy-neutral homes. Heijmans will monitor and
maintain the homes and provide residents with guidance
for 18 years after delivery. This is necessary to ensure that
the residents’ annual balance of energy consumption
does indeed end at zero at the end of the year.
Solar Highways
In October, Heijmans announced a new project in
cooperation with a number of partners to build energy-generating noise barriers: Solar Highways. The 68
noise barriers will be installed along the A50 near Uden,
and will generate enough energy to provide 40 to 60
homes with electricity. This makes Solar Highways the
largest project in Europe aimed at generating energy
using integrated solar noise barriers. The work started in
early 2018 and the energy-generating noise barrier will
be connected to the electricity grid by the end of the year.
Heijmans and its partners will then evaluate and monitor
the performance of the screens for 18 months. The
outcome will be used to make accurate assessments in
the realisation of similar initiatives in the future.

Other sustainability actions
GPR certificate
As of the year under review, Heijmans is making GPR
certificates available for all the homes it develops, making
the sustainability of the homes both measurable and
visible. GPR Gebouw is a digital tool that maps out all
relevant sustainability aspects in a building and makes
them measurable, using ratings for energy, environment,
quality of use and future value. The tool can be used at
every stage of construction: from development and design
through realisation and renovation. GPR Gebouw is a
leading certification method in the construction sector.
Sustainable timber
In the year under review, Heijmans used around 12,000
m3 of timber in its projects. Around 99 percent of the
timber comes from certified, sustainably managed forests
and around 78 percent of this has been FSC certified. This
brings Heijmans close to achieving it's target of using
100% sustainable timber.
Circularity
Raw materials are becoming increasingly scarce. The
continued extraction of natural resources is putting
enormous pressure on the earth’s long-term perspectives
and this has created a real sense of urgency in terms of
developing alternatives. Making systems circular is one of
the key solutions on this front and it can be done in a
number of stages. Heijmans uses the Value Hill tool to
gain insight into existing systems, to break open systems
and discover new opportunities and possibilities. The
greatest added value for Heijmans is in the pre-realisation
stage: by creating smart designs and working with
partners to develop plans that assume the longest
possible life and enable the re-use of buildings, parts of
buildings or the materials used. We also make distinctions between the re-use, renovation, redesignation of a
product or building and/or the recycling of materials and
residual substances. Heijmans has various examples of
this approach available. For instance, Restaurant 'Bij
Daphne in de Kas' in the Vathorst neighbourhood of
Amersfoort was built with existing and old building
materials. Heijmans’ Greenway LE products re-use raw
materials, and in the conversion of homes to zero energy
consumption, we renovate existing homes to significantly
improve their energy performance. In the case of
self-healing asphalt, an existing product heals itself by
using its own unique built-in properties, a process that is
activated using a simple procedure.

Circularity goes well beyond product development, as it
also involves process improvements. The Building
Information Model (BIM) contributes to this by providing
all partners in a process with insight into each other’s
activities and their collective result. This helps reduce the
costs of failure and increases efficiency. Heijmans was
also involved in the development of Madaster in 2017.
The purpose of Madaster is the elimination of waste by
giving materials an identity. The platform acts as a public,
online library of materials in the built environment.
Madaster registers, orders, saves and makes data available
while devoting significant attention to safety, privacy and
continuity.

Waste flows, reduction and separation
In 2018, we will launch the Heijmans raw materials
network. This tool will provide insight into the supply
and demand of material flows, which will in turn
encourage and facilitate the re-use of materials and
reduce transport movements. In this context, we will no
longer look at overall quantities across the entire
company, but rather assess the situation per project to
ensure we handle material flows in the most sustainable
and cost-efficient manner possible.

Monetisation
In 2017, Heijmans took further steps in the field of
monetisation. In 2016, Heijmans developed a tool in the
construction of the Karel de Grotelaan project in
Eindhoven to monetise projects based on the GPR
methodology. This year, we ran calculations for the entire
property portfolio of the ZOwonen housing corporation.
This revealed that the full realisation of the corporation’s
ambitions could result in a saving on social costs. You can
find more information in the article on the Heijmans
website.

Human rights
The EU directive on reporting non-financial information
and information on diversity, includes an explicit
requirement to report on the relevance of human rights
for Heijmans from 2017 onwards. The company can
have a direct and indirect impact on human rights in the
Netherlands and the rest of the world with its activities.
Heijmans endorses the general premises of the Guiding
Principles related to companies and human rights laid
down in UN resolution 17/4 on 16 June 2011. These
describe the exceptional obligation of companies to
comply with all relevant legislation, to respect human
rights, and to take appropriate, effective measures if
rights or obligations are infringed. Heijmans realises

78

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

APPENDICES

that it can also have a positive impact by, for example,
drawing up fair collective labour agreements, procuring
sustainable materials, and collaborating with partners
that adhere to these same principles.
A significant proportion of the human rights aspects
that are relevant at Heijmans apply to the entire
construction sector. When we talk about human rights, it
is often in terms of violations, yet many of the issues
related to this theme receive daily attention from
management and are a standard part of the active
management of safety, HR and the procurement policy.
This involves issues such as safeguarding healthy
working conditions, freedom of association (trade
unions), applying fair and equal pay policies, and taking
into consideration sustainability aspects in procurement. Tracing the source of materials with a sustainability label, such as those for sustainable timber, is a part
of this. Heijmans also has attitude and behaviour rules
based on a number of basic human rights principles.
These are an integral part of the employment terms and
conditions and are actively promoted and brought to
the attention of employees. They therefore have an
impact on the conduct and actions of all Heijmans
employees.
Heijmans endorses various international human
rights-related frameworks such as ILO directives, OECD
directives and the aforementioned Guiding Principles.
Heijmans also has various reporting mechanisms and a
whistle-blower’s scheme to monitor this aspect. When it
comes to chain responsibility and procurement, this
subject requires a material analysis of the risks associated with the procured products and a discussion with
stakeholders on the reach and depth of monitoring.
Heijmans involves its suppliers and subcontractors in
this dialogue. As part of Heijmans’ sustainable procurement policy, the company also monitors compliance
with the procurement agreements by means of careful
selection of suppliers (preferred supplier policy) and via
account management. The implementation of the
actions Heijmans has undertaken or has yet to undertake as part of the Act on Sham Employment
Arrangements (WAS) also plays a role on this front. This
is how Heijmans accepts its responsibility in the chain.
The company has developed KPIs related to human
rights, subdivided into the categories safety, HR and
procurement policy.

industry. The main certificates that apply to the entirety
of the Heijmans organisation are: ISO 9001, ISO 14001
and VCA. Heijmans also has numerous sector-specific or
material-specific certifications. The Heijmans website
provides an overview of all prevailing certifications.
Green Deals and cooperation agreements are agreements
reached at industry level. By reaching sector-wide
agreements on sustainable design, construction,
procurement and production, Heijmans and its partners
and peers contribute to a future-proof construction sector
and a sustainable country. Heijmans participates in
many Green Deals and makes an active contribution to
making the Netherlands sustainable.
ISO: Heijmans has been certified as fully ISO 9001
(quality) and VCA (SCC, safety) compliant since 2011.
Heijmans N.V. has also been certified as compliant with
ISO 14001 (environment) since 2013. This certification was
extended for a period of two years in the year under
review.
The Foundation for Climate-Friendly Procurement and
Business (SKAO): Heijmans Infra has held the highest
certification on the SKAO CO2 performance scale
(formerly Prorail's CO2 performance scale) since 2010.
This certification increases Heijmans’ chances of winning
tender bids, as a growing number of public sector
organisations are making this certificate a requirement in
their tenders.
ProRail Safety Scale: Heijmans Infra has been certified at
level 3 of the ProRail Safety Scale since mid-2013.
Improving our performance on safety will also be a high
priority in the next few years. ProRail transferred the
safety ladder to NEN as of 2016.

Dilemmas
Sustainability and company interests
Heijmans has developed numerous initiatives to increase
the sustainability of its own operations. Further upscaling
on this front will require investments. This is a difficult
choice at a time when margins remain under pressure
and investments do not always pay off in terms of
winning projects. For instance, this applies to increasing
sustainability by reducing natural gas consumption for
heating in asphalt plants.

Overview Green Deals

Standards and regulatory restrictions
The application of innovative sustainable materials,
products or solutions is not always in line with the
bandwidth provided for in existing regulations. The
dilemma is combining innovation with respect for
regulations. One example is the Heijmans ONE, a
temporary home that is placed in so-called ‘pause
landscapes’ (land that may be developed in the future) or
areas temporarily designated for residential purposes.
The challenge is to have these homes meet existing
regulations while at the same time there is such an
explicit need to use and enliven these areas, to increase
safety and give such areas more urban significance.

In 2017, Heijmans signed a number of Green Deals or city
deals:
• National Raw Materials agreement: this agreement is
a follow-up on government plans to encourage a
circular economy. Heijmans contributes to this effort

Measuring Circular Building
The concept of circular building is gaining in popularity,
as evidenced by the large number of government policy
plans and plans in cities such as Amsterdam and

FSC and PEFC (sustainable timber): Heijmans obtained
FSC and PEFC certification in 2015. In 2016 - just like the
year before – Heijmans shared first place in the ranking
and with BAM was the joint leader of the Forest50, which
ranks the Netherlands' 50 largest construction enterprises in terms of their use of sustainable timber. In 2017,
Heijmans occupied fourth place in the ranking.

Rotterdam. Tenders increasingly require the inclusion of
concrete plans for circular building. However, tools to
measure the level of circularity are often still lacking.
This creates the risk that subjective criteria will become
the standard. At the same time, building companies
want to develop these concepts and provide concrete
solutions for their clients.
Increasing sustainability of area versus building
Energy transition is a dominant trend in the construction sector. A lot of regulations in this area are geared
towards increasing the sustainability of individual
homes. However, creating far-reaching effects requires
area-wide measures, such as the introduction of
collective heating systems and remote sustainable
energy generation. However, upscaling on this front
means a rapid increase in the number of stakeholders
and this often makes the business case unattainable.
The alternative of searching for solutions at building
level is simpler but does slow down the pace of the
transition. This challenge requires cooperation between
corporations, municipal authorities and private buyers.

Corporate governance
Generally speaking, corporate governance is about sound and effective management of a
company, supervision of that management and how the execution of the strategy is
reported to all the company’s stakeholders, including shareholders, employees, clients
and society in general.
Factors that play a role in this include the strategy and the achievement of the company’s
business objectives, the corporate culture and how the company meets its reporting and
transparency obligations.
A disciplined and unified corporate culture is a precondition for the successful execution of
Heijmans’ ‘Focus, discipline and excellence’ strategy. Heijmans endorses the importance of
good corporate governance and a code of conduct for the achievement of its business
objectives and the realisation of the related corporate culture. And in doing so, Heijmans
strives to maintain the highest possible standards. What this means in effect is that
Heijmans respects and complies with legislation, and observes and initiates guidelines
that apply either to the company specifically or to the industry in general. Additionally,
this means that Heijmans also strives to achieve the highest possible levels of integrity
and transparency in its actions and any decision-making that affects its stakeholders.
Heijmans also strives to conduct a continuous dialogue with these stakeholders and to
distribute information simultaneously and accessibly.
For more detailed information on how governance and supervision are organised at
Heijmans, see the Corporate Governance Statement (as referred to in Sections 2(a) in
conjunction with 3 through 3(b) of the Decree Adopting Further Provisions Regarding the
Content of Annual Reports (Vaststellingsbesluit nadere voorschriften inhoud jaarverslag)
and including the information required under the Decree implementing Article 10 of the
Dutch Takeover Directive), which is available on the Heijmans website under the heading
'Corporate Governance: Codes, Articles of Association and regulations'.

Corporate culture
In late 2016, Heijmans formulated a number of new core values that are now being disseminated right across the organisation and that flesh out the Heijmans ‘Focus, discipline and
excellence’ strategy. These values are ownership, result-orientation and collaboration. In
2017, Heijmans implemented this programme under the header "IK". You will find a more
detailed explanation of this programme in the People and organisation chapter of this

Corporate Governance in general
Heijmans attaches a great deal of importance to achieving an equitable balance between the interests of its
various stakeholders. The basic principles of the Heijmans
corporate governance structure are good business
conduct, integrity, reliability, client focus, openness and
transparent dealings by the management, as well as the
proper supervision of same. Heijmans endorses the
principles of the Corporate Governance Code to the effect
that the company is a long-term alliance of the various
stakeholders in the company.
Depositary receipts for Heijmans shares are issued
through the SA Trust (Stichting Administratiekantoor
Heijmans). The purpose of this is to prevent resolutions
being adopted by a shareholders meeting through a
random majority. The depositary receipts for shares are
freely exchangeable for ordinary shares.
Employee representation
A key stakeholder group, our employees, is represented
by a number of representative bodies within the
Heijmans organisation. Until May 2017, Heijmans had a
Central Works Council and a works council for each
business area. This representative structure changed
following the Works Council elections in May 2017.
Following these elections, the company installed a single
works council, the Works Council Heijmans the
Netherlands. The company also installed a number of
committees, each with its own remit, such as finance,
social policy and communications, comprising both
members of the works council and other members.
Following the divestment of Heijmans’ foreign subsidiaries in early 2017, the company dissolved the European
Works Council.
In the period to May 2017, the Central Works Council met
five times, with three of these meetings in the presence of
the Chairman of the Executive Board. A member of the
Supervisory Board also attended one of these meetings.
In the period after May 2017, the Works Council Heijmans
the Netherlands met nine times. The Chairman of the
Executive Board attended five of these meetings and a
member of the Supervisory Board attended one of the
meetings. Over the course of 2017, the works council dealt
with seven requests for approval and five requests for

Implementation of the Corporate Governance Code
2016 and compliance with and deviations from the
code
Both the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board
conducted an extensive review of the Corporate
Governance Code 2016, which has also been passed into
law since year-end 2017. Heijmans has implemented
the code by amending the regulations governing the
Executive Board, the Supervisory Board and the
Supervisory Board committees. Heijmans endorses the
underlying principles of the corporate governance code
and has incorporated these principles as such in the
company’s corporate governance structure.
Heijmans deviates from the recommendation of the
code with respect to one best practice:
Best practice 4.4.3 stipulates that a director may be
appointed to the board of the trust office (SA Trust) for
two four-year terms, after which they may be appointed
for two terms of two years each. The report of the board
of the trust office must provide grounds for any
re-appointments after a term of eight years.
Heijmans endorses this provision. The current Articles of
Association of the Heijmans Share Administration Trust
(SA Trust) include a provision (Article 4.1) that states that
members of the SA Trust board shall be appointed for a
maximum period of four years, and may be re-appointed
twice for a further period of four years, therefore taking
the total to 12 years. Additionally, it is also stated that it
is possible to deviate from this maximum in exceptional
circumstances. In accordance with these provisions, in
March 2017 Mr. W.M. van den Goorbergh was appointed
for a period of four years for the fourth time. This
decision took into account the importance of continuity
within the board, partly in view of the current terms of
the other board members and in relation to the phase
Heijmans is in at this time. Both Heijmans and the
board of the SA Trust endorse this best practice and the
board of the SA Trust is currently preparing an amendment to its articles of association.

preference shares in the capital of Heijmans N.V. up to a
maximum of (close to) 100% of the face value of the
issued capital in ordinary shares and financing preference shares B.
The purpose of the Trust is to protect the interests of the
company in such a way that these interests, and the
interests of all those involved, can be safeguarded as
effectively as possible and any influences that could
affect the company’s independence, continuity and/or
identity in conflict with these interests can be resisted as
effectively as possible. The purpose of taking protective
preference shares is to provide the opportunity and the
time to effect the protection of the above-mentioned
interests in the event that the company finds itself in a
potentially undesirable situation. .

Powers of the shareholders’ meeting and the rights of

Supervisory Board and the Executive Board consider it
important that as many shareholders as possible
participate in the decision-making at shareholder
meetings. The notice of convocation, agenda and
documentation to be dealt with at a shareholder meeting
are all published on the company’s website at least 42
days in advance of the meeting. As far as possible, the

amend the Articles of Association or to dissolve the
Company, and the designation of the Executive Board as
the body authorised to acquire and issue shares.

Limitations on the transfer of shares
There is no limitation in the Articles of Association or
contractually on the transfer of shares or depositary
receipts for shares issued with the cooperation of the
Company, except for the block on transfer and delivery of
financing preference shares B laid down in the Articles of
Association. Article 11 of the Company’s Articles of
Association stipulates that the Company’s Executive
Board must approve any transfer of financing preference
shares B.

Substantial shareholdings in Heijmans
Holders of shares and depositary receipts for shares that,
as far as the Company is aware, held an interest of more
than 3% in Heijmans as at 31 December 2017, according
to the Register of Substantial Shareholdings of the Dutch
Financial Markets Authority (AFM), are listed on page 17,
in the section entitled ‘The Heijmans Share’.

Protective measures (special controlling rights,
limitation of voting rights)
The shares into which the authorised share capital of the
Company is divided do not endow the holders with any
special controlling rights. The Company does not have
any employee participation plan or employee share
option plan. There are no limitations on the exercise of the
voting rights attached to ordinary shares or the depositary receipts for ordinary shares. The number of votes

value of €0.21 is contractually restricted to 1,278 votes.
The Company’s Articles of Association include the usual
provisions related to registration as a recognised party
entitled to attend and to vote at a shareholders’ meeting.
Article 6 of the Company’s Articles of Association states
that the Executive Board, with the Supervisory Board’s
approval, is designated by the General Meeting of
Shareholders as the body authorised to issue shares or
depositary receipts for shares. The scope and duration of
this power is determined by the General Meeting of
Shareholders.

Agreements with shareholders that may limit the
transfer of (depositary receipts for) shares or limit
voting rights
The Company is not aware of any agreement involving a
shareholder that may limit the transfer of (depositary
receipts for) ordinary shares issued with the cooperation
of the Company, or limit voting rights in said (depositary
receipts for) shares.

Amendment of the Articles of Association
A resolution to amend the Articles of Association can only
be passed by a majority of at least two-thirds of the votes
cast at a General Meeting of Shareholders at which at
least half the issued capital is represented, unless the
proposal for such a resolution comes from the Executive
Board, acting with the approval of the Supervisory Board.
If a proposal for a resolution stems from the Executive
Board acting with the approval of the Supervisory Board,
the resolution can then be passed by a simple majority of
the votes, regardless of the capital represented. The
Company will discuss the content of any proposal to
amend its Articles of Association with Euronext
Amsterdam N.V. before submitting it to the General
Meeting of Shareholders.

Authorisation of the Executive Board with respect to
the issuance of shares and the acquisition of treasury
shares
In accordance with the Articles of Association, on 12 April
2017 the General Meeting of Shareholders designated the
Executive Board, with the approval of the Supervisory
Board and for a period of 18 months commencing on 12
April 2017, as the body authorised to:
• issue shares and/or grant rights to acquire shares. The
mandate to issue ordinary shares is limited to 10% of
the issued share capital on 12 April 2017, plus 10% if
the issue takes place as part of a merger or takeover, or
in the context of forging a strategic alliance. The

mandate to decide to issue preference shares covers all
preference shares in the authorised capital, either now
(the date of the meeting of 12 April 2017) or at some
future time, such without prejudice to the provisions of
Article 6 of the Articles of Association; and
• to limit or exclude the pre-emptive right to ordinary
shares in the event that these shares are issued,
making use of the above-mentioned right to acquire
shares.
Furthermore, the General Meeting of Shareholders of 12
April 2017 gave the Executive Board the authority - for a
period of 18 months commencing on 12 April 2017 and
subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board - to
decide that the Company will acquire ordinary and
financing preference shares B in its own capital, by
purchasing same in the market or by other means. This
authorisation is limited to 10% of the issued share capital
and the company may only purchase the treasury shares
at a price between their face value and 110% of the
average closing prices over the last five trading days prior
to the date the ordinary shares are purchased, and
between the face value and 110% of the issue price for
financing preference shares B.

Consequences of a public bid for important contracts
The agreement with the banking consortium includes a
change-of-control clause with respect to the facility of
€156 million (the amount at year-end 2017). This clause
states that the consortium must be informed of any
change of control, and must then be given the option to
demand early repayment. Change-of-control clauses
may also appear in joint venture agreements to which
subsidiaries are party.

Payments to members of the Executive Board upon
the termination of employment as a result of a public
bid
The Company has no agreements with the members of
the Executive Board or employees that provide for
payments upon termination of service resulting from a
public bid.

Conduct, integrity
and dilemmas
Culture and structure
Heijmans attaches a great deal of importance to ethical conduct by its employees. Openness
is a basic requirement for this ethical conduct. Heijmans encourages a more open working
attitude in a number of ways, including the example set by the Executive Board and senior
management, the discussion of large and complex projects in the weekly Executive Board
meeting, and the review meetings with management. In addition to this corporate culture,
Heijmans has introduced a structure for the reporting of issues related to conduct and
integrity. Such reports are then investigated and action can be taken if deemed necessary.
At the end of 2016, Heijmans formulated new core values, which are being disseminated
right across the organisation and flesh out Heijmans’ ‘Focus, discipline and excellence’
strategy. These values are ownership, result-orientation and collaboration. Heijmans
implemented this programme in the course of 2017 under the header "IK!".
Compliance Officer
Heijmans has appointed a compliance officer who acts as the central contact and reporting
point for integrity issues. The system safeguards the anonymity of any reports, and the
compliance officer reviews the action necessary in each individual case, taking into account
the nature of the issue and the applicable rules. In many cases, issues are resolved on the
shop floor, for instance in consultation between the employee and their supervisor. However,
this is not always the case.
Integrity Committee
The task of the Integrity Committee is to advise the company on integrity-related matters.
The Integrity Committee discusses integrity-related issues, dilemmas and themes and all
related matters twice a year in principle. On the basis of these discussions, the committee
then issues recommendations on the policy front or for instance the need to initiate training
courses. The Executive Board establishes the policy and decides which actions are to be taken
in this context. The Committee is chaired by the CEO. Other members of the Committee are
the Compliance Officer, the Procurement Director, the HRM Director, the IT Security Officer,
and the Chair of the Works Council. These are the core members of the committee.

PROFILE & STRATEGY

REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD

CORPORATE GOVERANCE

The committee discussed a range of topics on various
occasions, such as how to keep the subject of integrity
permanently top of mind for all employees. One subject
constantly on the agenda was whether it was possible to
improve the reporting structure at Heijmans and how this
could be done.

Dilemmas & conduct
Heijmans is firmly convinced that how we behave has a
significant impact on the quality of the company’s work
and financial performance. One example is the impact of
conduct in the field of safety, which can make a huge
difference in the construction industry.
A number of frequently occurring dilemmas are:
Should you call someone to account or not?
Of course, it is not always clear whether certain behaviour
is acceptable or not. Heijmans is still constantly faced
with integrity and conduct-related issues. By calling each
other to account in the event of undesirable conduct, in
line with the standards we strive to maintain, we actively
encourage more openness and, in the end, more acceptable conduct. Examples include the wearing of safety
clothing, the separation of waste at building sites, or the
deliberate submission of incorrect expense sheets, the use
of company property for personal purposes and unacceptable behaviour towards third parties.
To make it easier for employees to call each other to
account in cases of unacceptable behaviour, Heijmans
organises dilemma discussion groups, where employees
can discuss certain issues openly and freely.
Acceptable versus unacceptable behaviour
It is sometimes difficult to define the fine line between
acceptable and unacceptable behaviour, but doing it is
crucial for the culture on the shop floor. One example is
inappropriate behaviour towards others.
Self-determined rules versus applicable rules
Even when the rules that dictate how we should act and
what Heijmans considers acceptable behaviour are laid
down in the code of conduct, unstated and different rules
are still accepted in certain situations. Once again, this
could apply to the likes of submitting expense sheets,
payments or the use of company equipment. It can be
difficult for (new) employees to go against the flow and to
remind colleagues of the actual rules.
Many of the issues reported are related to the above-mentioned conduct and dilemmas.

Annual Report 2017 - Heijmans

Compliance
In 2017, nine integrity issues were reported to the
compliance officer and/or the counsellors. Heijmans
encourages its employees to report actual or suspected
abuses and provides various options for submitting such
reports. The Compliance Officer also regularly sends out
requests to management and HRM for reports. The
Executive Board believes it is important that employees
feel free to file reports and know that their reports will be
taken seriously. The reports made in 2017 related to
unacceptable behaviour by employees. Examples
included taking company property and/or surplus
materials, demanding terms from suppliers and/or
subcontractors for personal gain and inappropriate and/
or unprofessional behaviour by managers. The reports
led to written (final) warnings or dismissal. The first
consideration in each case was the seriousness of the
incident and this was then followed by an investigation
of the facts in all cases. All reports are discussed at
Executive Board meetings and subsequently evaluated
by the relevant managers.

Integrity and conduct
The integrity and conduct Heijmans expects from its
employees are laid down in a number of rules and
guidelines:
• Integrity-sensitive positions: Heijmans has a
‘Procedure for Integrity-Sensitive Positions’. Integritysensitive positions include members of the Executive
Board, directors of operating companies, project
directors, directors of staff services, property developers, development managers and other managers,
company lawyers and procurement managers.
Heijmans also has a fixed procedure for the screening
of employees. On the basis of this procedure,
employees in an integrity-sensitive position and
applicants applying for such a position are asked to
provide a Personal Statement of Judicial Records and
are also asked to submit a Certificate of Good
Conduct.
• Reviews: the Executive Board discusses integrity
issues and they are shared with the management
teams (on an anonymous basis). The Integrity
Committee is responsible for translating reports and
issues into appropriate policy.
• The 'Kr8 van Heijmans' Code of Conduct: With the
motto "A question of character", the Heijmans Code
of Conduct lays down what Heijmans considers
desirable conduct. This Code deals with matters such
as safety, integrity and competition and requires
Heijmans employees to act and behave in accordance with its provisions. The Code of Conduct is
linked to a sanctions policy. Managers are required to

PROFILE & STRATEGY

REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD

CORPORATE GOVERANCE

set an example by their personal conduct. The Code
of Conduct is an integral part of the employment
contract with permanent and temporary personnel,
and also applies to any self-employed contractors
with whom Heijmans works.
• Integrity is a fixed item for job interviews and
introduction programmes.
• To encourage integrity in its project development
activities, in 2009 Heijmans Property Development
set up a Transaction Register in accordance with the
NEPROM Code of Conduct, in addition to its quality
management system and the Heijmans Code of
Conduct. The Transaction Register is used to
investigate, record and document the relevant details
of every business-to-business property transaction in
advance, making it possible to check transactions for
correctness, integrity and lawfulness after the fact.
This is also endorsed and incorporated in Heijmans'
procurement policy.
• Procurement: New suppliers are asked to sign a
sustainability statement that includes rules with
respect to improving social aspects, working conditions, health & safety and the environment.

Fighting corruption and bribery
Heijmans is well aware of the fact that the trust its
clients and partners, as well as its shareholders and
employees, have in the company is crucial to our licence
to operate. That trust will be damaged if Heijmans or its
employees are guilty of corruption and/or bribery.
Fighting corruption and bribery is an integral part of
Heijmans’ general compliance programme, set up to
prevent unacceptable and illegal behaviour. Heijmans
states in the Integrity and Ethical Conduct sections of
the Heijmans Code of Conduct, which governs the
employment contracts of all Heijmans’ employees, that
it expects employees to avoid all actual or apparent
conflicts of interest between personal and business
interests. Employees are not allowed to accept or offer
any gifts or invitations that call into question the
independence of either Heijmans or the purported
recipient of said gifts or invitations. Heijmans and its
employees must abide strictly by all legal rules and
generally accepted norms applicable to business
operations and that are expressed in Heijmans’ own
guidelines, such as the Transaction register used within
Heijmans Property Development. Heijmans imposes the
application of its code of conduct or an equivalent code
on the subcontractors and partners with whom it does
business. If an employee can, by the nature of his or her
position, find themselves in a situation where they are
more likely to encounter corruption or bribery, the
company will devote specific attention to this situation,

APPENDICES

for instance by organising special training. Procurement
is viewed as a major risk in the light of corruption and
bribery. Heijmans has taken measures to mitigate this
risk. For instance, the most important aspects of
procurement are centrally organised, which increases
the level of direct supervision; the most important
preferred suppliers are chosen centrally and very
carefully; procurement has a clearly defined segregation
of tasks and procedures that are subject to the ‘four-eyes
principle’; plus the company uses standard contracts
that are exchanged digitally. Heijmans also has a
system of functional coordination between project
procurement and the central procurement organisation.
In early 2018, Heijmans introduced a transparent
evaluation system for suppliers, which excludes
suppliers that fail to meet Heijmans’ standards from our
list of preferred suppliers.
Heijmans has taken a range of preventative measures to
safeguard integrity, including integrity training for
employees and the design and implementation of
control systems, such as those described in the Risk
Management chapter. In addition to this, Heijmans has
introduced a number of mechanisms for the (anonymous) reporting of integrity-related issues (reporting
procedure integrity & misconduct), see further on in this
chapter. In addition to these measures aimed at
preventing and identifying integrity issues, these issues
are also discussed in a committee set up for this
purpose. Heijmans does not have any quantifiable
performance indicators at this time.

Compliance
Heijmans has appointed a number of counsellors for the
business units and at holding company level to
implement and safeguard compliance with the Code of
Conduct. These counsellors can give advice on dilemmas
encountered by employees in the course of their daily
activities. Heijmans requires its suppliers and subcontractors to endorse the Heijmans Code of Conduct, the
Dutch Construction Industry (employers’ group
Bouwend Nederland) and NEPROM codes of conduct or
their own (industry) code. Heijmans' subsidiaries,
associates and joint ventures are included in the register
of the Foundation for Evaluating the Integrity of the
Building industry (SBIB). Every two years, we file a
report with the SBIB on any breaches of the Heijmans
Code of Conduct, together with an account of how
Heijmans dealt with said breaches.

Additional and separate regulations
In some cases, values from the Code of Conduct have
been incorporated in additional and separate regulations:
• Dossier statement
The Heijmans Code of Conduct has also been defined
in more detail in the so-called dossier statement. This
statement is required with every bid issued. It consists
of an explicit statement by the responsible management that preparation of the tender or quote did not
involve any anti-competition practices.
• Internal reporting procedure
For those situations in which it is either difficult or
impossible to find a solution within the scope of daily
workplace activities, some time ago Heijmans
introduced an internal reporting procedure, which
states the steps to be taken when submitting a report
of an abuse. It also describes how such reports are
investigated, and defines the role of management in
the event that a report is submitted. This internal
reporting procedure offers employees the opportunity
to report an abuse orally or in writing to the central
reporting point (the compliance officer) or a counsellor,
without endangering their legal position under
employment law. Employees can also report abuses
anonymously via the SpeakUp system.

Dutch Human Environment & Transport Inspectorate
In early 2014, Heijmans was the first contractor to sign a
declaration of intent with the Dutch Human
Environment & Transport Inspectorate (IL&T) as a
preliminary to a compliance covenant related to the
enforcement of the (extremely extensive) set of regulations that fall within the remit of the Inspectorate.
Heijmans already has such a covenant in place with
regard to the Dutch Driving Times Decree. The IL&T
supervises enforcement of the regulations in several
so-called domains, including soil, transport and
dangerous materials. An enforcement covenant
introduces horizontal supervision, on the basis of which
Heijmans is expected to report deviations on its own
initiative, and to take preventative measures and report
annually to the IL&T. Within Heijmans, the IL&T domains
mainly cover the activities of Infra. The IL&T and
Heijmans N.V. signed the covenant on 26 June 2015. The
agreement was extended for a five-year period at the end
of 2017 and will be reviewed annually.

• Insider Trading Regulations Heijmans N.V.
These regulations, amended following the implementation of the EU Market Abuse Regulation in mid-2016,
contain provisions that apply to the officers stated in
the above-mentioned regulation other Heijmans
employees.
• Personal investments regulation
Heijmans has a set of regulations that apply to
personal investments by members of the Executive
Board and the Supervisory Board. The Chairman of
the Executive Board is the compliance officer for
transactions in shares, depositary receipts for shares
and options on shares. The Chairman of the
Supervisory Board acts as compliance officer for the
Chairman of the Executive Board.

Risk management
Following the negative result Heijmans reported in 2016, the year under review was
marked by the recovery in the continuity of the company. Heijmans sold its foreign
subsidiaries, reduced its net debt, secured its financing base through to mid-2019, and
made significant progress in the resolution of issues related to a number of large projects.
Risk management was a major priority in the year under review.
This section of the annual report describes the risk profile of the company, the associated
risk factors, the actions taken to mitigate these risks and the priorities for 2018 on this
front.
Heijmans’ main risks are:
• Strategic risks
• Market risks (residential, non-residential, infra and the procurement market)
• Operational risks, the most relevant to Heijmans being:
–– Insufficient control of project risks when acquiring and executing projects;
–– Safety risks
–– Retention and recruitment of personnel risks
• Financial risks, the most relevant to Heijmans being:
–– Lack of liquidity
–– Capital ratios that hinder the execution of the strategy
–– Insufficient capacity of bank guarantees
–– Inadequate financial robustness of partners
• Legal and compliance risks:
–– New forms of collaboration
–– Increasing importance of other jurisdictions
–– Disputes and legal proceedings
This risk section also describes the main items of attention in the management letter from
the external auditor. Before exploring the specific risks and mitigating measures, we will
first describe the company’s risk profile and general risk management measures.

REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD

CORPORATE GOVERANCE

Risk profile and risk appetite
Heijmans is active in construction and infrastructure
projects, including management, maintenance and/or
services, and additionally in property development and,
to a lesser extent, in Public-Private Partnership (PPP)
projects. In addition, Heijmans produces a limited
quantity of end products such as asphalt. In 2017,
Heijmans re-examined its risk appetite in the light of its
weakened financial situation. Partly on the basis of this
re-examination, Heijmans divested its foreign subsidiaries
and lowered its risk appetite.
The distinction between construction and infra projects
on the one hand and property development (and PPP
projects) on the other has an impact on the risk profile.
Construction and infra projects
Target margin: operational margin of 3-4%.
Moderate risk profile focused on a profitable business
model.
The construction and infrastructure projects, including
services, are based on contracts that Heijmans executes,
with a large part of the work to be executed outsourced to
third parties. These activities are marked by relatively low
operating profit margins. Heijmans targets operating
profit margins of 3-4% for these activities. The business
model for these types of activity is profitable when
projects involve – on average - negative working capital
that effectively results in little or no investment of capital.
Infra activities generally involve a somewhat higher level
of capital investment than construction or installation
projects, partly due to the greater use of the company’s
own equipment. This makes it essential to devote a great
deal of attention to the management of downside risks.
After all, if they do indeed materialise, these risks can
quickly result in unprofitable activities when working with
low operating profit margins. The flipside to avoiding
these risks is that Heijmans may sometimes have to
deliberately turn down potential upside opportunities. To
achieve a profitable business model, Heijmans therefore
strives for a moderate risk profile on this front.
When Heijmans revised its risk appetite, it also categorised the projects in more detail. In this process, Heijmans
looked at items such as the annual revenue from a project
in relation to the company’s revenue, the type of contract,
the client, the competency fit and the risk profile of the
chosen solution. This process is used as a basis to assign
each project a risk category (1 to 3).
This classification is based on: the higher the risk profile,
the higher the authorisation in the organisation, the
higher the return requirements and the more frequent
the project monitoring.
In addition, Heijmans is striving for a better revenue mix

98

Annual Report 2017 - Heijmans

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

APPENDICES

at Infra, with a shift in the ratio of large projects on the
one hand and regional projects, specialist activities and
asset management on the other is developing in favour of
the second category of activities.
Property Development
Target margin: operational profit margin of 7-8%.
Moderate risk profile focused on stimulating the turnover
rate of capital.
The property development and PPP activities require a
higher level of invested capital, which in turn requires
higher returns. In these markets, Heijmans aims to
achieve an operating profit margin of 7-8%. The time
factor is an important component of the risk profile for
these activities. For instance, capital is frequently utilised
for longer periods of time to generate higher returns.
Here, too, Heijmans aims for a moderate risk profile to
improve the turnover rate of its capital. What this means
in practical terms is that invested capital is constantly
utilised as quickly as possible for property development
production. In a tightening of this policy in 2017,
Heijmans decided to invest only in new real estate and
land holdings if these can be developed within the next
five years.
End products
The risk profile of end products such as asphalt is
primarily determined by the scale of the production
capacity needed. This capacity is effectively aligned with
the demand from Heijmans’ own projects, as well as
deliveries to third parties.

General risk management measures
The premise of Heijmans' approach to risk management
is the structural, integrated and timely identification and
monitoring of key opportunities and risks based on the
above-mentioned risk profile. The objective is to effectively
anticipate and mitigate uncertainties and threats, but also
to take advantage of any opportunities. Heijmans has
designed its risk management in line with the principles
of the COSO-ERM framework, assigning a prominent role
to the risk management of projects.
Risk management is embedded in a management model
marked by centrally organised operating companies with
short lines of communication to the Executive Board. The
sale of the non-Dutch activities in 2017 led to a clear
enhancement of Heijmans’ system of centralised
management. In addition, Heijmans effected the execution of its strategy via a number of improvement
processes aimed at the company’s operational core
processes and the promotion of a culture that, in addition
to openness and transparency, also incorporates taking

Procedural measures

Important aspects within the control framework are:
• Management regulations and instructions for the
management of operating companies/business
units related to authorities, the acquisition of
projects, entering into investment commitments
and reporting and accountability obligations.
• Conduct-related instruments such as the Heijmans
Code of Conduct and the IK! programme - see the
Strategy and People and organisation chapters for
more information on this.
• An accounting manual with rules for internal and
external financial reporting and related procedures.
• Business process systems for the primary and
secondary processes of the construction and
property development operations, including risk
management systems, with the aim of achieving
uniform processes across the group. This includes
the completion of the SAP/ERP implementation in
the organisation and the implementation of the
new HR system.
• A register of statements as an extra safeguard for
the integrity of senior management and specific
positions.

responsibility and ownership. For more information on
this, see the Strategy and People and organisation
chapters of this annual report.
The control framework consists of various formal
procedural and organisational measures that are applied
right across the company. Heijmans’ open culture, in
which ownership plays a prominent role, also makes a
major contribution to the management of risks.
In addition, Heijmans uses a number of control mechanisms, including the planning and control cycle, reviews
and reporting, that are embedded in the organisation.
These control mechanisms are explained below.

Heijmans uses the following control mechanisms:
• A planning and control cycle, with monthly
reporting by operational management on matters
such as the trends in relevant markets, the
financial situation relative to the budget, the
financial and operational status of projects, and
safety.
• Tender board, GO/NO GO procedures and gate
reviews for tenders, under which all category 3
tenders require the approval of the Executive
Board.
• Regular project reviews: all projects are divided into
various risk categories (1, 2 and 3). The Executive
Board discusses risk category 3 projects at least
once a month and the category 2 projects each
quarter.
• Regular review meetings between the Executive
Board and the operating companies.
• The daily monitoring of movements in the
liquidity position of group entities and the
monthly monitoring of specific projects.
• Company-wide process audits, aimed at compliance with control measures in the context of
project-specific risks, and the control of other
company-wide risks. In 2017, Heijmans conducted
50 audits.

Organisation and the Chief Risk Officer (CRO)
The Executive Board determines Heijmans’ strategy and
its related risk appetite. Heijmans has an organisational
structure under which the operating companies are
managed centrally with short lines of communication to
the Executive Board. The central management teams of
the operating companies, the Executive Board and the
staff departments are located in the head office in
Rosmalen. This promotes the open and informal culture,
which in turn makes the exchange of information both
quick and efficient. In 2017, Heijmans introduced the role
of Chief Risk Officer (CRO). The aim of the CRO is to take
risk management to a higher level at every level and
across the entire breadth of the company. In 2018,
Heijmans will adjust the management of the financial
function. Following this adjustment, all financials will
have a direct reporting line within the financial function
to the CFO, safeguarding independence vis-à-vis the line
management even more effectively.

PROFILE & STRATEGY

REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD

CORPORATE GOVERANCE

The Executive Board is supervised by the Supervisory
Board – see also the Corporate Governance chapter. The
Executive Board and the Supervisory Board consult with
each other in scheduled meetings and on an ad-hoc basis
if this is deemed necessary, and risk management or
topics directly related to risk management are frequently
on the agenda of said meetings.
Culture
Heijmans believes that the culture of the organisation is a
significant factor in the management of risks. Due to the
risks inherent in projects they entail a certain level of
unpredictability, and this cannot be mitigated entirely
with guidelines and procedures. These require a certain
level of flexibility and an open and action-oriented
culture, in which people display sufficient ownership to
solve any problems that may arise. The example set by
the management is crucial to this, as is the willingness to
call each other to account in the event of the failure to
honour agreements, but also to point out items that have
gone well. The use of conduct-related instruments, such
as the Heijmans Code of Conduct and the IK! Programme
- see the Strategy and People and organisation chapters

have practical guidance on what Heijmans expects from
them in terms of behaviour and what behaviour is
deemed unacceptable.
Internal guidelines and procedures
The Executive Board determines the parameters within
which the directors and management of the operating
companies can operate. The authorities related to project
acquisition, entering into investment commitments and
reporting and accountability obligations are embedded in
management regulations and instructions to the
management of the operating companies/business units.
Rules for internal and external reporting are laid down in
the Accounting Manual, including related procedures,
such as the procedure for investments. The operating
process system includes descriptions of the primary and
secondary processes of the construction and property
development operations, including risk management
systems used to monitor and control project-related risks.
This increases the uniformity of the process for the entire
group. The Heijmans-wide roll-out of the SAP-based ERP
platform that was completed in 2017 also made a
significant contribution to this uniformity. Heijmans has
also designed procedures related to the tender process
that prevent the company from taking on any projects
with irresponsible levels of risk.

Tenders are divided into three categories depending on,
among other things, the scope, the type of contract,
complexity and type of client. Rules for authorisation and
escalation have been laid down for each category. For
instance, the final decision on whether or not to submit a
quote for the projects in the highest risk class, category 3,
rests with the Executive Board. This procedure includes a
number of phases that need to be completed with a
decision as to whether to proceed with a tender (GO/NO
GO). The standard documents that are recorded in each
phase are registered in a system developed for that
purpose, which is also used to record the GO/NO GO
decision. Several months after a category 3 project has
been awarded, Heijmans conducts a project status update
(PSU) review, to determine among other things whether
the premises used during the tender phase are still
applicable or whether these need to be adjusted. The CRO
plays an important role in the tender process and the
management of risks in the execution of the project.
Planning and control cycle
The Executive Board consults with the management of
the operating companies and project managers on a
regular basis and on an ad-hoc basis if this is deemed
necessary. In these meetings, the Board and the management review matters such as the developments in
relevant markets, the financial situation in relation to the
budget, the financial and operational status of projects
and safety on the basis of monthly and quarterly reports.
Projects in progress with a high risk profile (primarily
category-3 projects) are subject to separate regular project
reviews with the Executive Board and the CRO, in the
presence of the project manager in charge of the project.
The monitoring of actual and estimated future liquidity
movements is based on three reporting lines:
• Net debt is reported on a daily basis, such on a
consolidated basis and per business area. This pertains
to an overview of both all bank balances and the
(project) financing facilities. The movement is then
compared with the forecast. Inadequate liquidity is a
key early warning criterion and is discussed immediately with the management in question.
• A liquidity forecast for the next thirteen weeks is drawn
up on a weekly basis. Every two weeks, the management of the business areas are interviewed to discuss
these forecasts and the potential impact of individual
projects on said forecasts. This reporting line is used,
among other things, to get a better understanding of
the current liquidity movements and to gain advance
insight into the sensitivities in said liquidity
movements.

PROFILE & STRATEGY

REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD

CORPORATE GOVERANCE

• A monthly liquidity forecast for the next 12 months.
This is then used to test whether the available
financing facilities will be sufficient to meet the
company’s cash requirements. This forecast is also
used to allocate each business area its own limit on
house bank funding.
Dossier statement
The management responsible for a tender has to sign a
dossier statement for every quote submitted. In this
statement, they declare that the preparation of the quote
did not involve any anti-competition practices. When
joining the company, members of the senior management team and employees in specific positions are asked
to provide a Personal Statement of Judicial Records and a
Certificate of Good Conduct (verklaring omtrent gedrag
- VOG) issued by their local council, as an extra safeguard
for integrity. The submission of these statements is
recorded in a register. The statements are also saved in
the personnel file of the employee in question. The
employees in question provide a new personal statement
every three years. Upon the publication of the half-year
and annual results, the management of the operating
companies submit a confirmation letter, in which they
affirm, among other things, that all relevant information
is accurate and has been incorporated in full in the
figures, and that it has been explained in sufficient detail
in the reports of the operating company.
Audits
In 2014, Heijmans appointed a risk and audit manager,
with the aim of taking the company’s internal audit
programme to a higher level. The primary task of the risk
and audit manager is to initiate and conduct audits that
are sufficiently operationally focused, including clear
feedback reporting to management in question. In 2017,
Heijmans conducted around 50 audits under the
management of the risk and audit manager. The main
focus of the risk and audit manager’s activities in 2017
was on the implementation of the GRIP programme and a
controlled settlement of the divestment of Heijmans’
foreign subsidiaries. The focus of the audit programme in
2018 will be on items that are vital to (financially)
successful projects: in particular the compliance with
procedures related to tender and project management,
adequate contract management, qualified and committed
project teams, the management of opportunities and
risks, adequate project controls, cash management and
learning potential (evaluation and post-project calculations). Heijmans’ external auditor EY will audit the annual
financial statements. EY provides support for consortiums

in which Heijmans participates and in a number of
instances provides support for the activities of other public
auditors.

Risks and mitigating measures
Strategic risks have an impact in the medium to long
term or the long term. Generally, these risks manifest
gradually over time. Heijmans sees the main risks in this
category as failing to respond effectively enough to the
need to create differentiating potential, to operate
sustainably and to be innovative. In addition to this, there
is also the question of whether the company’s scale in a
particular market segment is appropriate and offers
sufficient perspective. Important considerations in this
respect are having the knowledge and expertise required,
and ensuring the correct deployment of people and
materials.
Strategic risks and management measures
In principle, the Executive Board monitors strategic risks.
The Executive Board continuously analyses and evaluates
the development of the operational activities in relation to
the attractiveness of markets and market segments. The
board also initiates actions with the aim of turning
identified risks into opportunities. In this context, in late
2016 Heijmans decided to take a comprehensive
approach to the continued recovery of the company,
including safeguarding the company’s financing. The aim
was to transform Heijmans into a purely Dutch company.
Heijmans implemented and completed this process in
2017. In view of this, it is no longer possible for Heijmans
to spread risks across different countries and geographical
areas, but it has increased the manageability and focus of
the company. This tightened focus of the strategic plan is
built on three pillars: (focus: margin, discipline: de-risking
and excellence: execution), with a major focus on the
optimisation of the cost structure and margins. Heijmans’
approach to sustainability is embedded at Executive
Board level, in the portfolio of the Chairman of the
Executive Board.

uncertainties related to strategic land holdings, such as demographic developments, location, designing and working out
development plans and management decision-making, and as
location-specifically as possible. This provides a location-specific
forecast of developments in land and house prices and other
variables, which ultimately determine the indirect revenue value
of the land holdings. Heijmans conducts twice-yearly internal

The liquidity risk
pertains to the chance
that the company’s
financing needs are at
some point greater
than the available

provided by the
financing facilities
made available.

• Active monitoring of liquidity movements on the basis of daily
and weekly cash reports.
• Testing whether liquidity forecasts are still valid. All the business
areas draw up these forecasts on a weekly basis for three months
in advance and on a monthly basis for the next twelve months.
Every two weeks, the company conducts a cash review with the
financial directors of the business areas to discuss assumptions
and map out risks for the period ahead.
• As a result of the losses on the risk projects at year-end 2016, and
taking into account the liquidity forecasts, in early 2017 Heijmans
reached new agreements with its banks with respect to the
committed credit facility. One of these agreements was that the
current account credit of € 25 million would from that point
forward be committed as part of the total credit line of € 155.9
million as at 31 December 2017, which will be reduced to
• € 122 million as at 30 June 2019. The committed financing facility
is at Heijmans’ disposal, provided the company complies with
various covenants.

Financial risks
Liquidity risk

In 2018, the applicable financial covenants are the Interest Coverage
Ratio (EBITDA/interest at a minimum level of 4), the Leverage Ratio
(recourse debt /EBITDA at maximum level of 3) and Average Leverage
Ratio (average recourse debt /EBITDA at a maximum level of 2.5). On
the basis of the budgets drawn up, Heijmans appears to have
sufficient headroom to be able to meet the conditions of these
covenants.
In addition to this, as part of its Fit for Cash programme, Heijmans
has a continuous stream of initiatives in place to keep the invested
capital in Property Development and the working capital in Infra,
Non—Residential and Residential Building at a predictable and
controlled level. The GO / NO GO criteria for new projects and the
monitoring of existing projects also put a great deal of emphasis on
the requirement that projects have effective financing plans.

Solvency risk

Clients / suppliers
may decide to exclude
Heijmans from certain
tenders or require
additional bank
guarantees for
compliance with
execution obligations
if Heijmans fails to
meet solvency
requirements.

• The sale of Heijmans’ foreign subsidiaries. The combination of
book profits and the balance sheet reduction helped Heijmans to
raise solvency back above the desired 25% level.
• The (accelerated) development of land holdings, which reduced
the invested capital in property. This had a positive impact on
cash flows.
• Stringent working capital management, driven by the Fit for
Cash programme. In 2017, Heijmans devoted a great deal of
attention to the reduction of the impact of seasonal patterns on
its working capital to average out the company’s financing
requirements through the year and to monitor the headroom in
the facility more effectively.
• Clear agreements and information sent to other financial
stakeholders to limit the risk of credit-limiting measures by
guarantors and credit insurers.

Availability of bank
guarantees

If bank guarantees are
withdrawn, this may
result in a situation in
which Heijmans no
longer has access to
new bank guarantees,
which may in turn
mean that it cannot
meet its contractual
requirements in
project tenders. A
(negative) change in
the terms could lead
to more stringent
conditions, which
could in turn damage
Heijmans’ competitive
position.

• Heijmans has a guarantee policy, which includes a detailed
description of which conditions are set per type of guarantee,
terms, amounts guaranteed, etc. The aim of this policy is to avoid
unreasonably high, long-term and double sureties, thereby
limiting the call on guarantee facilities. Treasury ultimately tests
all guarantee requests against the guarantee policy and these are
then submitted to the various guarantors.
• Heijmans closely monitors the headroom in the guarantee
facilities: every two weeks, the company draws up a Heijmans–
wide overview of all guarantee requests that may need to be filled
out in connection with ongoing tender processes and projects. Not
only does this make it possible to estimate whether the current
guarantee facilities are sufficient for the coming period; it also
enables the early identification of any bottlenecks with respect to
the guarantee policy.
• Intensive stakeholder management with bilateral financiers. In
other words, keeping guarantors up-to-date on the financial
situation and the importance of current exposure.

Creditworthiness of
partners

If a partner is unable
to meet its obligations,
it is possible that
Heijmans, as co-partner in the consortium
formed for the project
(usually a general
partnership) could
become liable for the
execution of the entire
scope of the project.
This would render
Heijmans financially
and operationally
responsible for
precisely that part of
the scope for which
Heijmans had sought
a partner.

• It is standard procedure to test the creditworthiness of partners
in advance. If this is considered inadequate, Heijmans seeks
additional assurances. This can take the form of a financial
guarantee, or Heijmans might explore the possibility of accruing
sureties at the level of the consortium, such as the retention of
consortium-based pre-financing reserves.
• The parties involved also sign a consortium agreement before
submitting a tender quote. This includes a detailed demarcation
of the respective obligations.

Legal and compliance risks
New business models
are resulting in new
forms of cooperation
and new partners

The manner of the
cooperation and the
intended goal are
insufficiently defined
and/or the need to do
so is recognised too
late, which means that
Heijmans interests are
inadequately
safeguarded.

• Heijmans has several professionals in its Legal Affairs and
Procurement departments who are specifically tasked with
guarding against this.
• There is a growing awareness of the need to think about the
manner of the cooperation and to lay down agreements related
to same at an early stage, and Heijmans’ boards, and Legal
Affairs and Procurement directors are involved at an early stage
of any alliances.
• Existing knowledge is made as widely available as possible
internally and whenever possible Heijmans draws up model
agreements. Heijmans organises training courses to increase the
depth of knowledge on this front.
• Heijmans selects external experts to provide support whenever
necessary.
Additional focus in 2018:
• In 2018, a number of legal experts will devote specific attention
to new business models, and will remain a contact point for all
colleagues (within and outside Legal Affairs). Via scheduled
consultations, they will also keep this subject on the agenda.

(Long-running)
disputes and legal
procedures.

Disputes and legal
procedures can have a
major financial
impact. If a dispute
arises during a project
in progress, this can
have serious consequences for the
execution and progress
of a project (in terms of
time and money).

• In the tender phase, certainly for larger, more complex projects,
Heijmans carries out intensive contract assessments (according
to a fixed format). At year-end 2017, Heijmans revised this format
and made it standard procedure in all business areas.
• Heijmans has made the role of contract management in larger
projects more explicit (GRIP). In project teams, it is always clear
who acts as the contract manager.
• Heijmans makes sure contracts with various parties are harmonised by, whenever possible, using standard contracts, ensuring
effective transition from tender to execution phase, and by
limiting any changes in a project team.
• The insurance policy is tailored as much possible to the business
operations. Insurability is a major attention point in the tender
phase.
• Heijmans is alert to so-called early warnings, such as delays,
poor liquidity, cost overruns and bad atmosphere, and acts upon
these warnings.
• In the event of (potential) disputes, Heijmans frequently puts
together inter-disciplinary teams, who come together according
to a standard procedure, providing the right knowledge, expertise
and commitment to arrive at a good result. If it proves impossible
to prevent a legal procedure, Heijmans devotes careful consideration to which lawyer, expert and/or mediator it would be best to
deploy.
• Due to the fact that any dispute involves not only those
responsible for the project, but also colleagues with a little more
distance from the problem that has arisen, it is easier to not get
bogged down in principles and not to lose sight of the best end
result, such as an amicable settlement.
• Initiation of alternative dispute mediation, ideally before there is
an actual concrete dispute.
Additional focus in 2018:
• Via the Heijmans Academy, Heijmans will organise training
courses on standard terms and conditions in the construction
industry, such as the UAV and UAV-GC (uniform administrative
conditions).

Implementation of and

European General Data
Protection Regulation

Risk statement
It can generally be concluded that in 2017 Heijmans
actually implemented the measures it proposed, as
outlined above:
• Sale of non-Dutch activities
• Tightened focus on core competencies and projects
that Heijmans is capable of executing
• Maintenance of strict procedures and related risk and
audit functions
• Attention devoted to recruitment, retention and
deployment of the right people in the right place and
development of the required competencies
• Attention devoted to cultural aspect and core values
• The introduction of the GRIP programme
• Introduction of the CRO function
Partly in view of the above, the Executive Board can state
that given the current situation it was justified to prepare
the financial statement on the assumption that Heijmans
will continue as a going concern and that the risk and
control systems generally functioned properly, for which
the company had to make an extra effort in a number of
large Infra and Non-Residential projects. With respect to

the financial reporting risks, Heijmans’ internal risk and
control system provide a reasonable level of certainty
that the financial reporting as shown in the financial
statements for 2017 (pages 131 through 218) do not to
our knowledge contain any material misstatements.
However it is not possible to provide absolute certainty.
Heijmans can therefore not guarantee the absence of
material mistakes, fraud or the violation of legal regulations. This annual report includes an explanation of the
risks and uncertainties relevant to the expectation that
the Company will continue as a going concern for a
period of twelve months after this report was drawn up.
The optimisation and monitoring of the functioning of the
internal risk management and control systems remains a
key priority for the Executive Board. In the year under
review, the Executive Board and the audit committee, as
well as the entire Supervisory Board, discussed the
structure and operation of the internal risk management
and control systems intensively and frequently. In the
year under review there were no integrity issues that had
an impact on the company’s risk profile.

Report of the
Supervisory Board
The Supervisory Board has taken note of the report of the Executive Board for the 2017
financial year. The financial statements have been audited by Ernst & Young Accountants
LLP and the latter issued an unqualified auditor’s report on 23 February 2018. The auditor's
report is included on page 218 of the financial statements. We recommend that the General
Meeting of Shareholders adopt the 2017 financial statements and grant discharge to the
members of the Executive Board for their management of the company. We approve the
proposal by the Executive Board not to pay out a dividend on (depositary receipts for)
ordinary shares for 2017, in view of the importance of the recovery of the balance sheet.

Position and key developments in 2017
Role and powers of the Supervisory Board
The Supervisory Board supervises the strategy of the Executive Board and the general course
of business at the Company and its affiliated company and advises the Executive Board. The
Supervisory Board also focuses on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal risk management and control systems and the integrity and quality of financial reporting. In the
performance of its duties, the Supervisory Board acts in the interests of the Company and its
affiliated companies and in doing so takes into account the legitimate interests of the
Company’s stakeholders. The Supervisory Board also takes into account the social aspects of
business operations that are relevant to the Company. The Articles of Association of
Heijmans N.V. and the Regulations for the Supervisory Board of Heijmans N.V. include rules
with respect to board meetings and resolutions. Both of these documents are available on
the Heijmans N.V. website under the heading "Corporate Governance: Codes, Articles of
Association and Regulations".

Specific areas of supervision
The Supervisory Board’s supervision of the Executive Board includes aspects such as the
strategy geared towards value creation, the realisation of objectives, the risks associated
with business activities, the structure and operation of the internal risk management and
control systems, the process of financial reporting, compliance with legislation and
regulations, shareholder relations (for further details, see the section ‘Corporate

section of this annual report), the activities of the
Executive board with respect to the culture within the
company, the operation of the reporting procedures for
abuses and irregularities and the social aspects of
business operations that are relevant to the Company.

Accents and activities in 2017
Development of results
The Supervisory Board was once again intensively
involved in the company’s affairs, partly in view of the
developments initiated at the end of 2016. In early 2017,
Heijmans extended its financing and sold its foreign
subsidiaries, following intensive consultations between
the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board. This
created a solid basis for debt reduction and an improvement in capital ratios. The Board also gave its undivided
attention to the ‘Focus, Discipline and Excellence’
programme. In its meetings, the Supervisory Board also
devoted extensive attention to the ‘margin-over-volume’
policy, the continued professionalisation of the organisation and the improvement of internal processes. The
Supervisory Board was consulted frequently on the
reduction of the risk profile of a number of large projects.

Financing
In early 2017, Heijmans reached new agreements with its
financiers as a result of which the financing facility was
extended until 1 July 2019. Under the agreement, 2017
was subject to amended covenants, while the previous
covenants came back into effect in 2018. The agreement
also includes a phased reduction of the credit facility. The
Supervisory Board and Executive Board frequently
discussed the progress of the results in relation to the
requirements laid down in the financing agreement. The
results achieved meant that Heijmans was able to
accelerate the reduction of the credit facility to € 156
million as at 1 November 2017, which the Supervisory
Board considers very positive indeed.

Strategy
The year under review also saw considerable focus on the
fleshing out of the strategy that Heijmans outlined in
2016, which includes a focus on the Dutch market, the
realisation of an improved risk profile, and improved
capital ratios. The Supervisory Board believes the
extension of the financing and associated agreements
places Heijmans in a good position to work on a stronger
Dutch company. The Supervisory Board has discussed
the detailed strategy with the Executive Board and has
approved same. The Supervisory Board will follow the
execution of the strategy closely in the years to come.

Annual Report 2017 - Heijmans

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

APPENDICES

Improvement across the board is considered a highly
important aspect and this is an integral part of the
strategy. The uniform application of processes and
quality standards is crucial to the reduction of costs and
increase in efficiency. This will enable the company to
make greater use of its own acquired know-how and
experience, to create ‘routine’ and ensure a generic
approach to projects. Risk assessment, limitation and
control play a crucial role in it. The Executive Board is
directly in charge of the process of continuous improvements, including the likes of the GRIP (Geen verrassingen
in projecten) programme to eliminate surprises in
projects. The Supervisory Board kept itself up to date on
the progress made in the fields of renewal and
innovation.

Corporate governance
The Supervisory Board was kept abreast of the developments in the field of Corporate Governance, including the
new Corporate Governance Code, which was published in
December 2016 and was taken into law in 2017. In view of
this revised Code, Heijmans updated the regulations of
the Supervisory Board and Executive Board, and the
company reported on the 2017 financial year in line with
the Corporate Governance Code 2016. For more information, we refer to the Corporate Governance chapter on
page 83 of this annual report.

Frequency of meetings and attendance
In 2017, the Supervisory Board held seven scheduled
meetings in the presence of the Executive Board. A
number of these meetings were preceded by internal
consultations within the Supervisory Board. In addition,
the Board held five meetings in the form of conference
calls. At two of the meetings, one member of the
Supervisory Board was unable to attend: Ms. Boumeester
and Mr. Van Keulen respectively. Ms. Boumeester was
unable to attend one of the conference calls. Messrs.
Vollebregt, Icke and Van Gelder were present at all
meetings and participated in all conference calls. The
members of the Board who were unable to attend used
the opportunity available to them to discuss the items on
the agenda with the Chair prior to the meeting and were
therefore given the opportunity to express their views on
said subject. All the members of the Remuneration
committee and the Selection and Appointments committee attended all meetings of said committees. Mr. Van
Keulen was absent from one meeting of the Audit
committee.
During its meeting of June 2017, the Supervisory Board
visited the Beatrixsluis lock project in Nieuwegein. Ahead
of the meeting, the project management provided an

extensive presentation on the project, which prompted an
intensive discussion of project management in the
meeting. The Supervisory Board members also made a
number of individual project visits.
The Company's external auditor attended the meeting at
which the financial statements for 2016 were discussed.
The Supervisory Board is represented a number of times
each year at the consultation meetings of Heijmans'
Works Council. The Supervisory Board members hold
regular consultations with the members of the Executive
board, depending on the specific portfolio of each
Supervisory Board member. This is true in particular for
the Chair of the Supervisory Board and the Chairmen of
the Selection and Appointments committee, the Audit
Committee and the Remuneration Committee.

2016 and was appointed to the Executive Board in April of
that year. During this period, he put a great deal of effort
and commitment into Heijmans’ Infra activities. The
Supervisory Board and the Executive Board are very
grateful to Mr. Majenburg for his efforts and his major
contribution to the company.
In the year under review, after the Extraordinary Meeting
of Shareholders of 17 October 2017, the Supervisory
Board appointed Mr. J.G. (Hans) Janssen to the Executive
Board as of 30 October 2017, for a period of four years.
In close consultation with the Chairman of the Executive
Board, the Supervisory Board considered the optimal
composition of the Executive Board. This resulted in a
joint decision to have the Executive Board consist of two
members.

Resolutions
The important resolutions of the Supervisory Board in
2017 included the following:
• Approval of the strategy;
• Approval of resolution of the Executive Board to adopt
and change the operational and financial objectives of
the Company;
• Approval of the 2017 business plan and budget of
Heijmans N.V., which outlines the strategic principles
of the policy;
• Approval of the dividend proposal of Heijmans N.V.;
• Approval of the proposal of the Executive Board with
respect to the appropriation of the results of Heijmans
N.V. for the financial year 2016;
• Approval of the decision of the Executive Board to
enter into an agreement on an extension of the
syndicated credit facility until 1 July 2019;
• Approval of the decisions of the Executive Board to sell
Oevermann, as well as the Belgian subsidiaries in the
context of the improvement of the company’s capital
structure;
• Approval of the specification of the criteria for
short-term and long-term variable bonuses of the
members of the Executive Board;
• The resolution to appoint Mr. J.G. (Hans) Janssen to the
Executive Board as of 30 October 2017, such for a
period of four years, after the close of the Extraordinary
Meeting of Shareholders of 17 October 2017;
• Entering into a dialogue with Mr. R.F. (Ruud) Majenburg
with respect to his departure from the Executive Board.

Executive Board
The composition of the Executive Board changed in 2017.
On 26 October 2017, Heijmans announced the departure
of R.F. (Ruud) Majenburg as board member of Heijmans as
of that date. Ruud Majenburg joined Heijmans in January

As of end-October 2017, the Executive Board has two
members. Their areas of attention per January 2018,
are as follows:
• Mr. A.G.J. (Ton) Hillen, CEO: General affairs, Property
Development, Building and Technology*, Infra,
Sustainability, HR & Management Development, PR &
Communications, Innovation.
• Mr. J.G. (Hans) Janssen, CFO: Finance, Investor relations,
ICT, Legal Affairs, Pensions, Procurement and Facilities.
* until 1 January 2018, Residential Building and NonResidential were separate business areas. Their operations have been integrated into the Building &
Technology business area as of that date.

Self-assessment Supervisory Board
One of the principles of the Dutch Corporate Governance
code is that supervisory boards are collectively responsible for their own performance, with self-assessment being
defined as a best practice. In the fourth quarter of 2017,
the members of the Supervisory Board, partly with
support from an external party, assessed the board’s own
functioning, and the interactions with the Executive
Board. The self-assessment was based on the completion
of an extensive questionnaire, and individual interviews
with all parties concerned, these being the members of
the Supervisory Board, the members of the Executive
Board and the company secretary. The ensuing report
was discussed with the Supervisory Board. As a result of
the assessment, the Board subsequently discussed and
implemented a number of measures for improvement.

Diversity
The composition of Heijmans' Supervisory Board is
diverse in terms of gender, background and experience.

REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD

CORPORATE GOVERANCE

Under the Management and Supervision Act, larger
companies are obliged to strive for a composition of at
least 30% female and 30% male members on the
Supervisory Board, insofar as the seats on the board are
filled by natural persons. One of the five members of the
current Heijmans Supervisory Board is female, representing 20% of the total. Given the total number of seats, the
target ratio of 30% will not be achieved. For further
background information on all the Supervisory Board
members, see page 114 of this annual report. The target
profile for Supervisory Board members is available in the
‘Corporate Governance section of the website. In the event
of vacancies - other than reappointments - the
Supervisory Board aims to increase the diversity of the
experience and competencies of its members. The
diversity policy applicable to the Executive Board and
Supervisory Board is included in the Corporate
Governance statement, see page 83 of this annual report.

Committees
The Supervisory Board has appointed three committees:
the Audit Committee, the Selection and Appointments
Committee and the Remuneration Committee. The Board
has drawn up Regulations for each committee, establishing the role of the committee in question, its composition
and how it carries out its duties. These regulations are
available in the ‘Corporate Governance’ section of the
(Dutch) Heijmans website under ‘Codes, Articles of
Association, Regulations’.

Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises three members of the
Supervisory Board and its duties cover a number of
financial areas. The matters discussed by the Audit
Committee are in preparation for the discussion of these
items by the full Supervisory Board. The subjects include
the interim report, the financial statements, the budget,
the reports of the external auditor, other financial
reporting, the operation of internal risk and control
systems, the relationship with and the evaluation of the
external auditor, the pension plans, and the changes in
the company’s financing requirements and debt position,
including the relationship with the company's financiers.
The Audit Committee also discussed the valuation of land
holdings, the state of affairs at the supplementary
company pension fund, the implementation of the SAP
ERP system, the company’s tax position, future amendments to IFRS regulations, and the list of issues. The
committee also discussed integrity and compliance, Risk
& Audit Management and the reports provided by the
Risk & Audit Manager.

The members of the Audit Committee are Mr. R. Icke
(Chair), Mr. R. van Gelder, and Mr. S. van Keulen. The
Committee met with the Executive Board on five occasions in 2017. The external auditor also attended a
number of meetings. The Committee consulted the
auditor on one occasion in the absence of the Executive
Board.
When relevant, managers with responsibility for finance,
auditing, risks and compliance attended the meetings of
the Audit Committee, together with the CEO and the CFO.
Relevant items requiring approval from the full
Supervisory Board were submitted to the full Supervisory
Board together with a recommendation from the Audit
Committee.

Selection and Appointments Committee
The Selection and Appointments Committee establishes,
among other things, the selection criteria and appointment procedure for Supervisory Board members and
members of the Executive Board. The Committee also
evaluates, at least once a year, the performance of the
members of the Executive Board. To that end, the
committee conducts individual performance assessment
interviews with the members of the Executive Board at
least once a year.
The Selection and Appointments Committee met on four
occasions last year. There was also regular reciprocal
consultation. In view of the departure of Mark van den
Biggelaar, which was announced in November of 2016,
the Committee initiated a process in late 2016 to find a
new CFO / member of the Executive Board. This scrupulously carried out process demanded a considerable
amount of time and effort. Following an extensive
selection procedure, the committee found a suitable
candidate in Mr. Hans Janssen, and the Supervisory Board
subsequently decided unanimously to appoint Mr.
Janssen following the notification of the General Meeting
of Shareholders. This committee consists of Mr. S. van
Keulen (Chair), Ms. P.G. Boumeester and Mr. R. van Gelder.

Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee, which has the same
composition as the Selection and Appointments
Committee, carries out preparatory work for the
Supervisory Board with respect to the remuneration of
members of the Executive Board. This is based on the
remuneration policy for members of the Executive Board
that took effect on 1 January 2010 and was adopted by
the General Meeting of Shareholders on 28 April 2010.

In addition to their three regular meetings in 2017, the
Remuneration Committee had reciprocal consultations
on a number of occasions in the year under review. The
Committee also held talks with Ruud Majenburg about

Composition Supervisory Board
The Supervisory Board currently has five members. None
of the members were due to step down in 2017 pursuant
to the retirement schedule.
The current composition of the Supervisory Board,
together with the particulars of the members and
principal and other positions they hold is described on
page 114 of this annual report. Aside from Mr. Van Gelder
(as a former Chairman of the Executive Board of Heijmans
N.V. until 1 July 2010), all the other Supervisory Board
members qualify as independent as meant in Article 2.1.8
of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code.

In conclusion
Heijmans has gone through some difficult times in recent
years and has made every possible effort to get back on a
positive course. The Supervisory Board has determined
that in 2017 Heijmans made considerable progress
towards that goal, structural recovery. This is notwithstanding the fact that Heijmans will need to continue its
structural efforts with respect to strategic focus, tight
project selection policy, optimal cost structure, safety, and
improvements to its capital ratios. In short: on the
improvement of its results. The ‘Focus, Discipline and
Excellence’ programme launched last year will play a key
role on this front. The foundations of Heijmans’ sustainable success are the company’s skilled employees, who
excel in terms of their craftsmanship, their focus on
results and on working as a team, together with a solid
organisational structure.

Principles of the remuneration policy
The Supervisory Board of Heijmans N.V. pursues a remuneration policy for the Company’s
Executive Board that is based on the following principles:
• Executive remuneration must be such that it is possible to attract and retain top managers, not only from the building industry but also from related sectors, such as property
development and electrical and mechanical engineering;
• The remuneration policy must be consistent with the Company’s corporate governance
policy;
• Remuneration must be characterised by long-term value creation, the strategic and
financial objectives and must be performance-based to a significant degree, with an
appropriate balance between short-term and long-term results and/or objectives;
• Remuneration must not include any incentives that could result in individual behaviour
that is in conflict with the Company's interests;
The Heijmans N.V. Executive Board operates as a team with ultimate responsibility clearly
resting with the Chairman, although the other Executive Board member isalso accountable
for the overall end result, in addition to his specific areas of responsibility.

Relationship with the Corporate Governance Code
Heijmans endorses the principles relating to the remuneration of Executive Board
members stated in the Corporate Governance Code. Moreover, Heijmans endorses the
recommendations relating to the remuneration-related responsibilities of the Supervisory
Board and the role of the Remuneration Committee.
Heijmans observes the principle of a maximum appointment term of four years for
Executive Board members, as well as the compensation stated in the Code in the event of
involuntary dismissal.

PROFILE & STRATEGY

REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD

CORPORATE GOVERANCE

Positioning of the remuneration packages
Heijmans aims to offer remuneration packages at a
median level when compared to other remuneration
packages paid to directors of comparable enterprises in
the Netherlands. Moreover, the remuneration package
must be competitive and include the right incentives to
generate effective strategy and above-average performance. The Supervisory Board plans to update this
policy on a regular basis by reviewing it against market
developments and socially accepted standards.

Principles of the remuneration policy for
Executive Board members of Heijmans N.V.
The system chosen comprises a fixed basic salary and a
variable bonus depending on short-term targets
(variable bonus on an annual basis) and long-term
objectives (annually recurring variable remuneration on
a three-year basis). If both the short-term and long-term
targets are achieved, the total variable remuneration
amounts to 100% of the fixed salary. If performance
significantly exceeds or falls below the agreed targets,
the variable remuneration can be a maximum of 150% of
the fixed salary, or may be reduced to zero. On target
performance will result in a total variable bonus
consisting of 50% of the variable annual bonus, and 50%
of the annually recurring variable remuneration on a
three-year basis. Half (50%) of the variable annual bonus
depends on financial targets set each year. The remaining 50% is determined on the basis of individual
qualitative performance, as assessed by the Supervisory
Board.
If the Company closes any year with a net loss, the right
to a variable annual bonus for that year is only vested if
and when the company realises a net profit in the
following year or the year thereafter, subject to a
minimum level to be determined by the Supervisory
Board. Thereafter, any right to a variable annual bonus
for the year in question lapses. Half (50%) of the variable
remuneration on a three-year basis depends on financial
targets, and 50% on individual qualitative performance
and other non-financial criteria, at the discretion of the
Supervisory Board. The entire variable remuneration is
subject to a claw-back clause, whereby a variable
remuneration that has been allocated can be reclaimed
if it was awarded on the basis of incorrect information.
The Supervisory Board also has the discretionary power
to adjust the variable remuneration component granted
in a previous financial year if the Supervisory Board
believes this remuneration results in an unfair or
unreasonable situation due to very exceptional circumstances in the relevant assessment period (measure of
last resort).

Annual Report 2017 - Heijmans

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

APPENDICES

The Supervisory Board has the right to final review and
potential adjustment of any and all awards of variable
remuneration. The principles of the remuneration policy
for Executive Board members of Heijmans N.V. were
established by the General Meeting of Shareholders on
28 April 2010. The Supervisory Board sets the targets for
determining the variable remuneration of members of
the Executive Board. This pertains to the financial targets
and the qualitative performance targets used to
determine the annual remuneration and the long-term
remuneration for the preceding three-year period.

Pay ratios within the company in 2017
In line with best practice 3.4.1. sub iv, we have analysed
the pay ratio in the company, the difference between the
salaries of management-level employees and other
employees. This was calculated on the basis of the fixed
agreed remuneration, including holiday bonus, with
reference date 30 November 2017. The average fixed
agreed remuneration of the members of the Executive
Board as of the reference date was compared to a
reference group comprising all employees who, on the
reference date, had an employment contract with the
company (Heijmans N.V.) or one of its subsidiaries in the
Netherlands. The average fixed remuneration of the
members of the Executive Board was € 462,500 on the
reference date, compared with a fixed remuneration of €
52,553 for the reference group. Based on the above, the
pay ratio can be expressed as 1 to 8.8.
The Remuneration Committee takes the pay ratio into
account in the proposal it submits to the Supervisory
Board with respect to the remuneration of the individual
members of the Executive Board.

Activities in 2017
In 2017, the Remuneration Committee held three
scheduled meetings, in which it discussed the usual
annually recurring items, such as the remuneration of
the members of the Executive Board, the objectives in
the context of the variable remuneration, the variable
remuneration itself and the Bonus Investment Share
Matching Plan. In addition, the Committee members
discussed subjects among themselves on a number of
occasions. The Committee also discussed the departure
of Mr. R.F. Majenburg and the termination of his
management contract. The Committee submitted
proposals to the Supervisory Board on that subject and
on the subject of the remuneration of Mr. J.G. Janssen
upon his appointment as a member of the Executive
Board.

Variable remuneration
In view of the extraordinary circumstances Heijmans
found itself in towards the end of 2016 and in early
2017, the Supervisory Board decided to focus on the
short-term targets for 2017 and to combine the
short-term and long-term components for 2017. In view
of the results realised, the Supervisory Board awarded
Mr. A.G.J. Hillen a variable remuneration of 85% of the
fixed agreed remuneration and Mr. R.F. Majenburg a
variable remuneration of 75% of the fixed agreed
remuneration. The Supervisory Board granted the
members of the Executive Board a conditional shortterm variable remuneration for 2015 of 20% of the fixed
agreed remuneration. With respect for Mr. A.G.J. Hillen,
Heijmans made a reservation of € 79,132, which was
charged to the result for 2015. This award did not vest
and the sum was therefore released in the result for
2017.

Remuneration members of the Executive
Board
In addition to the amounts shown in the table above for
gross fixed salary, pension expense and expense
allowances for each (former) member of the Executive
Board, the following amounts are recognised in the
statement of profit or loss per member of the Executive
Board:

• The members of the Executive Board were granted a
short-term variable remuneration for 2017 of 85% of
the fixed agreed salary for Mr. Hillen and 75% for Mr.
Majenburg, in view of the realisation of the targets for
2017. The members of the Executive Board had been
granted a conditional short-term variable remuneration of 20% of the fixed agreed remuneration for 2015.
With respect for Mr. A.G.J. Hillen, Heijmans made a
reservation of € 79,132 which was charged to the
result for 2015. This award did not vest and the sum
was therefore released in the result for 2017.
• No reservation has been recognised for variable
remunerations for the periods 2016-2018 and
2017-2019 for the current members of the Executive
Board (2016: for the periods 2015-2017 and 20162018: € 0.2 million). No reservation was made with
respect to Mr. Hillen (2016: € 102,050) and no
reservation was made for Mr. Janssen (2016: nil).
• Mr. Majenburg was granted termination compensation
of € 404,563 gross upon his resignation as per 26
October 2017. This pertains to contractually agreed
compensation.
• In April 2014, Mr. Van der Els and Messrs. Van den
Biggelaar and Hillen acquired shares in Heijmans for
50% and for 20% respectively of the net short-term
variable remuneration for 2013. In the context of the

Share Matching Plan, a conditional share was granted
for each share acquired – a total of 2,289 shares. The
shares granted conditionally were vested after three
years, after which they are subject to a mandatory
lock-up period of two years. The total charge associated
with the granting of the shares is calculated at the
time the shares are awarded and is recognised pro rata
in terms of timing in the statement of profit or loss
during the period in which the awarded shares vested.
In the 2017 statement of profit or loss, Heijmans
recognised a charge of € 3,210 (2016: € 9629) with
respect to the shares awarded in April 2011. In April of
2017, a total of 2,289 shares became vested. In April of
2017, the Group issued 2,289 shares and awarded
same to the relevant (former) members of the Executive
Board; these shares are subject to a mandatory
two-year lock-up period.
• The pension scheme for Mr. Hillen pertains to the
pension scheme of the industry pension fund and the
directly insured average salary scheme. Mr. Hillen also
receives an annual compensation of € 34,021 (2016: €
33,600), adjusted for possible collective labour
agreement salary increases, for the lapse of the early
retirement pension scheme and Mr. Hillen also
received compensation of € 97,188 in 2017 (2016: €
65,538) for the loss of pension accrual on the salary
over and above € 100,000, plus a compensation of €
50,232 (2016: nil) for the loss of the indexation in the
Delta Lloyd average salary scheme. Mr. Majenburg
receives a fixed compensation for pension expenses,
which was € 72,822 in 2017 (2016: € 85,135) for the
period when he was a member of the Executive Board.
Mr. Janssen receives a fixed compensation for pension
expenses, which was € 14,667 in 2017.

Pension
The pension scheme for one member of the Executive
Board is a conditionally indexed average salary scheme,
in which pension is accrued on the gross fixed salary and
becomes payable at the age of 67 years. This pertains to
the accrual of retirement pension, surviving dependants’
pension and orphan’s pension. This Board member also
receives compensation for the loss of pension accrual on
their salary in excess of €100.000. In deviation from the
above, the other member of the Executive Board receives
a fixed payment for the accrual of his own pension
provision. Heijmans does not have any early retirement
schemes.

Bonus Investment Share Matching Plan
This plan is intended to secure the longer-term commitment of executive directors and reinforce their focus on
the long term and value creation for Heijmans by
encouraging them to buy ordinary shares/depositary
receipts for ordinary shares of the Company and hold
these for an extended period. Members of the Executive
Board can opt to invest part of their short-term variable
annual bonus after tax in shares in the Company's
capital. If a director, hereinafter referred to as “participant”, decides to invest, the investment is limited to 50%
of his or her gross short-term variable annual remuneration. The minimum contribution is 10% of the gross
short-term variable annual remuneration.
The shares purchased by the participant are subject to a
mandatory lock-up period of three years, during which
the participant may not transfer the purchased shares.
However, the participant is entitled to dividend during
the lock-up period. Immediately upon purchase, each
purchased share grants the participant the right to one
conditionally granted share (matching share), which are
only vested after three years, provided the participant is
still employed by Heijmans at that point. The matching
shares are then subject to a mandatory lock-up period of
two years. If the participant's employment terminates at
any time during the three-year period, the right to the
matching shares lapses (except in the case of retirement
or death). If the employment ends during the two-year
lock-up period, the matching shares remain blocked
until the end of the lock-up period. The regulations for
the Bonus Investment Share Matching Plan for the
members of the Executive Board were established by the
Supervisory Board on the basis of a proposal from the
Remuneration Committee in 2011.

Remuneration Committee
The members of the Remuneration Committee are Mr. S.
van Keulen (Chairman), Ms. P.G. Boumeester, and Mr. R.
van Gelder. To prepare the matter for consideration by
the Supervisory Board, the Remuneration Committee
focuses on the remuneration of members of the
Executive Board and members of the Supervisory Board.

Accounting principles

5. Accounting principles

Heijmans N.V. (referred to as the “Company”) has its
registered office in the Netherlands. The Company’s
consolidated financial statements for the 2017 financial
year include the Company and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the ‘Group’) and the Group’s investments
in associates and interests in jointly controlled entities.
The Executive Board prepared the financial statements on
23 February 2018. These will be submitted for approval to
the General Meeting of Shareholders on 11 April 2018.

(1) Statement of Compliance
The consolidated financial statements for 2017 were
prepared in accordance with the International Financial
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union
(EU-IFRS) and with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil
Code.

(2) Basis of preparation
The financial statements are presented in thousands of
euros. The financial statements are based on historical
costs, unless otherwise stated.
The preparation of the annual financial statements in
accordance with EU-IFRS requires management to make
judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and of revenue
and expenses. The estimates and their underlying
assumptions are based on experience and other factors
that are considered reasonable. The estimates form the
basis for calculating the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities that cannot easily be derived from other
sources. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
See also note 6.29, Management estimates and
judgements.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are continually reassessed. Revised estimates are recognised in the
period in which the estimate was revised, provided that
the revision only affects that period. Revisions are
recognised in the reporting period and future periods if

the revision also affects future periods.		
The accounting policies described below have been
consistently applied to all periods presented in these
consolidated financial statements and to all entities in
the Group, apart from the changes explained in (3).

(3) Implications of new standards
The IAS 7 amendment to IFRS 10 and 12 and to IAS 28
adopted by the EU and the annual improvements
2014-2016 cycle that apply to reporting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2017 have no material
effect on the consolidated financial statements.
For new standards that have not yet come into force,
Heijmans is looking into what impact they will have. This
mainly concerns IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, IFRS 15
Revenue from Contracts with Customers and IFRS 16
Leases.

(3a) IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments was issued on 24 July 2014
and was adopted by the EU on 22 November 2016. The
standard is effective for reporting periods commencing on
or after 1 January 2018. IFRS 9 generally requires that the
amount of the credit loss provision established on initial
recognition of financial instruments is measured on the
basis of the expected credit losses over the coming 12
months. Subsequently, as long as there is no significant
deterioration in the credit risk, the credit loss provision
continues to be measured at the amount of the 12-month
expected credit losses. If, however, a significant increase in
the credit risk occurs, on either an individual or a
collective basis, the amount of the expected credit loss
provision is measured as the expected credit losses over
the entire term to maturity of the instrument. In the case
of trade receivables, it is permissible to adopt a simplified
approach involving recognition of a loss allowance at an
amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses every
time. This new standard is not expected to have any
material impact on the Group’s financial results.

(3b) IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with
Customers
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers was
issued on 28 May 2014, amended on 11 September 2015
and was adopted by the EU on 22 September 2016.
The standard is effective for reporting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2018. On initial application, this
new standard is to be applied either fully retroactively
(including restatement of comparative figures) or merely
retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognised in
the opening balance of equity in 2018. The Group has
decided in favour of the latter option because we expect
the impact which IFRS 15 has on the financial results to
be limited, as explained below. Also, this method of initial
application is considerably more efficient (less labour-intensive) than a fully retrospective application.
IFRS 15 introduces a 5-step model for revenue recognition.
The steps are: 1. identifying customer contracts, 2.
identifying the performance obligations in a contract, 3.
determining the transaction price, 4. allocating the
transaction price to performance obligations and 5.
recognising revenue when performance obligations have
been satisfied.
The Group has carried out a detailed analysis of the
expected impact, based on the existing standards, the
internal reporting guidelines and IFRS 15. A further
assessment has been made of the effects on the major
contracts that run over from 2017 to 2018. The revenue
streams have also been analysed into categories with
similar attributes and the effects on each category have
been analysed, based on representative contracts. The
main conclusions to come out of these analyses at this
stage, which are mainly of a qualitative nature, are:

Identification of separate performance obligations: one of
the steps in IFRS 15 involves identifying the performance
obligations in a contract. Our analyses have shown that
this is not expected to introduce any material changes
compared with the existing reporting rules. For projects
involving both a construction component and a long-term
maintenance component, for instance, IFRS 15 means that
there will be two separate performance obligations, partly
because management of the contract will involve various
project teams. Under the existing rules, construction and
long-term maintenance are recognised as two separate
projects, meaning that IFRS 15 is not expected to have any
impact on contracts of this kind. In the case of housing
projects, the adopted position is that transfer of ownership
of the residential units is so intrinsically tied up with the

140

Annual Report 2017 - Heijmans

land beneath them that conveyance of the land and
construction of the homes can be seen as a single
performance obligation under IFRS 15. Under the existing
rules, conveyance of the land and construction of the
homes are accounted for as part of the same project so,
again, IFRS 15 is not expected to have any effects.

Variable consideration: under IFRS 15, it is only permissible to recognise as revenue that portion of the consideration for which it is highly unlikely that a significant
revenue reversal will occur. Under the existing rules,
revenue is broadly speaking only recognised when it is
probable. Where additional work is involved and with
respect to claims against clients, for example, IFRS 15
potentially means recognising more conservative
amounts.
Financing components in contracts: under IFRS 15, the
effects of the time value of money must be accounted for
separately if the payment date means that the customer
or the Group obtains a significant financing gain (unless
that gain does not arise out of financing arrangements
but has a different origin, for example because parties
wish to protect themselves against default). A practical
exception to this requirement is if there is less than one
year between payment and delivery. Our analyses have
shown that this will not lead to any material changes
compared with the existing rules, partly because the
Group will be availing itself of the practical exception.
Recognition of revenue at a point in time or over a period:
under IFRS 15, revenue is recognised when the performance obligation has been satisfied, i.e. the date on which
the customer takes control. This can be a particular point
in time or spread over a period. Our analyses have shown
that this is not expected to lead to material effects on the
financial results compared with the existing rules. In the
case of construction projects, for example, the Group
carries out works on the land owned by the customer. The
customer obtains control of the constructed works as and
when ownership is transferred. Partly for this reason,
therefore, the revenue from projects will be recognised
over a period under IFRS 15. Under the existing rules, the
revenue from projects is recognised in proportion to
progress, meaning that IFRS 15 is expected not to have
any effect.
Apart from the above aspects, there are numerous other
aspects that play a mostly minor role. One such aspect is
the way in which tendering fees and mobilisation costs are
to be treated under IFRS 15. Again, our analyses have
shown that this is expected not to have any material
effects on the financial results. Moreover, in the case of

PROFILE & STRATEGY

REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Accounting principles

Heijmans, there is a multitude of projects, so that
differences in the timing of revenue recognition will more
or less average things out (‘ideal complex’).

(4) Accounting policies used for consolidation

Analysis will not be completed until after publication of
the financial statements. The outcome of the current
discussions within IFRIC (International Financial
Reporting Issues Committee) will form part of this
analysis. Among other things, these discussions concern
the treatment of loss-making contracts (use of incremental costs or integrated costs) and the question of whether
the delivery of land and buildings should be seen as two
separate performance obligations. Depending on the
outcome of these discussions, there could be an impact
on the Group’s financial results. The extent of any such
impact will be determined when the outcome of the
discussions is known. The 2018 half-year report will be
prepared on the basis of IFRS 15.

A subsidiary is an entity over which the Group has direct
or indirect control.
Control exists if the Group:
a) has power over the entity;
b) is exposed or has rights to variable returns because of
its involvement with the entity; and
c) can use its power over the entity to affect the size of
these returns.
Each of these three criteria has to be satisfied to establish
that the Group has control over a company in which it
owns an interest. The financial statements of subsidiaries
are included in the consolidated financial statements
from the date that control commences to the date that
control ceases.

IFRS 15 has a number of requirements necessitating
various supplementary disclosures with respect to such
things as revenue categories, future performance
obligations (order book), contract assets and movements
in work in progress.

Business combinations are recognised according to the
acquisition method, as from the date on which control is
transferred to the Group. The transaction cost of an
acquisition is recognised at fair value, as are the net
identifiable assets acquired. Any resulting goodwill is
tested every year for impairment. Any gain from a
favourable purchase is recognised directly in profit or loss.
Transaction costs are recognised when these are incurred,
unless they relate to the issue of debt or equity instruments. The transfer sum includes no amount for settling
existing account balances. Such amounts are generally
recognised in the statement of profit or loss. The fair value
of a contingent payment is recognised on the date of
acquisition. If this conditional payment is classified as
equity, it is not subsequently remeasured. Instead, the
settlement figure is recognised in equity. In other cases,
adjustments after initial recognition are recognised in
profit or loss.

(3c) IFRS 16 Leases
IFRS 16 Leases, was issued on 13 January 2016 and was
adopted by the EU on 31 October 2017. The standard is
effective for reporting periods commencing on or after 01
January 2019. IFRS 16 will have material implications for
the statement of financial position in particular. If IFRS 16
had been applied to the 2017 financial statements, an
item representing right-of-use assets would have
appeared on the balance sheet, giving rise to an item of a
similar amount on the liabilities side in respect of finance
lease liabilities. This would have had the effect of
increasing the balance sheet total by approximately 10%.
In the statement of profit or loss, there would have been
changes in the items making up the operating result and
in the interest figures (result after tax remaining
unchanged), giving an increase in the operating result of
several million euros, with a similar increase in the
interest expense. Within the operating result, this gives
rise to a movement from operating expenses to depreciation, as a consequence of which EBITDA (earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) will increase.
This movement does not have any effect on the net result.
The impact on equity is expected to be limited in amount
on the date from which the change in accounting policies
becomes effective. The impact on the financial results for
2018 and ensuing years is expected to be of a similar
magnitude.

(4a) Subsidiaries (full consolidation)

(4b) Joint ventures and associates (equity
method)
A joint venture is a joint arrangement in which the Group
has joint control together with other parties, and has a
right to the net assets of the joint venture. The parties
involved have agreed contractually that control is shared
and that decisions concerning relevant activities require
unanimous approval from the parties having joint control
over the joint venture. A joint venture is recognised from
the date on which the Group shares control until the date
on which this ceases.
An associate is an entity over which the Group has
significant influence, but cannot exercise control.

Annual Report 2017 - Heijmans

141

PROFILE & STRATEGY

REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD

CORPORATE GOVERANCE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

APPENDICES

Accounting principles

Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Group
holds 20% or more of the voting rights. An associate is
recognised from the date on which the Group has
significant influence until the date on which this ceases.
Joint ventures and associates are recognised in accordance with the equity method and are initially recognised
at acquisition cost. The investments of the Group include
the goodwill determined during acquisition. The consolidated financial statements include the Group’s proportionate share of the comprehensive income determined in
accordance with the Group’s accounting policies. If the
Group’s share of the losses is greater than the value of the
interest in a joint venture or associate, the value of the
interest is written down to nil. No further losses are then
recognised except insofar as the Group has made a
commitment or intends to recognise the losses.

(4c) Joint operations (proportional
consolidation)
Joint operations are arrangements over which the Group
exercises control jointly with third parties. For its share in
a joint operation, the Group recognises its assets (including its share of the assets held jointly), liabilities (including its share of the liabilities incurred jointly), revenue
(including its share of the revenue from the output of the
joint operation) and expenses (including its share of the
expenses incurred jointly). In practice, the method for
recognising joint operations is comparable to that used
for proportional consolidation.

(4d) Elimination of transactions on
consolidation
Intragroup balances and any unrealised income and
expense arising from intragroup transactions are
eliminated when preparing the consolidated financial
statements.
Unrealised income from transactions with associates,
joint ventures and joint operations are eliminated in
proportion to the Group’s interests in the entities
concerned.

(5) Foreign currency
(5a) Transactions in foreign currency
Transactions in foreign currency are translated into euros
at the exchange rate prevailing on the transaction date.
Foreign currency balances, as well as assets acquired and
liabilities paid in foreign currencies, are translated at the
corresponding exchange rates prevailing on the closing

142

Annual Report 2017 - Heijmans

date. Foreign currency differences resulting from
translation are recognised in the statement of profit or
loss.

(5b) Financial statements of foreign
operations denominated in foreign currency
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are
translated into euros at the exchange rate prevailing on
the closing date. The revenues and expenses of foreign
operations are translated into euros at average exchange
rates.
Foreign currency exchange rate differences arising from
the translation of a net investment in foreign operations
and the associated hedging transactions are recognised
as other comprehensive income that after initial recognition is possibly reclassified to the statement of profit or
loss. When an investment is disposed of, the amount
transferred to equity is recognised in the statement of
profit or loss.
All foreign currency differences arising from foreign
operations are presented as separate equity components.

(6) Financial instruments
(6a) Derivative financial instruments
The Group may use interest rate swaps, cross-currency
swaps and inflation hedges to hedge its interest rate,
currency and inflation risk exposures arising from
corporate and project financing activities. Commodity
hedges may also be used in specific cases. In accordance
with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold derivatives for trading purposes. Interest-rate swaps, cross-currency swaps and inflation hedges are measured at fair
value.
The fair value of interest rate and inflation swaps is
calculated as the present value of the estimated future
cash flows. The fair value of forward currency contracts is
determined using the forward foreign exchange rates as
at the closing date.

(6b) Non-derivative financial instruments
Non-derivative financial instruments consist of investments in shares and bonds, trade and other receivables,
cash and cash equivalents, loans and other financing
liabilities, trade payables and other payable items. These
instruments are recognised initially at fair value, plus - for
instruments that are not recognised at fair value when

REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD

CORPORATE GOVERANCE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

APPENDICES

Accounting principles

their gains or losses are recognised in the statement of
profit or loss - all directly attributable transaction costs.
Thereafter, the current non-derivative financial instruments are measured at amortised cost, using the effective
interest method, less impairment losses.
A financial instrument is recognised if the Group becomes
a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets are derecognised if the contractual rights
to the cash flows arising from those financial assets
expire, or if the Group transfers the financial asset to
another party without retaining control or without
substantially retaining all the risks and rewards of the
asset. The normal purchase and sale of financial assets
are accounted for on the trading date, i.e. the date that the
Group commits itself to purchase or sell the asset.
Financial liabilities are derecognised if the Group’s
commitments specified in the contract expire or are
discharged or cancelled.

(7) Hedges
In principle, hedge accounting is applied to derivative
financial instruments, subject to the cash flow hedging
guidelines.
The Group may use derivatives to hedge its interest-rate,
currency and inflation risks. Changes in the fair value of
the derivatives that are classified as cash flow hedges are
recognised directly as other comprehensive income that
after initial recognition may be reclassified to the
statement of profit or loss, to the extent that the hedge
can be shown to be effective. To the extent that the
effectiveness of the hedge cannot be demonstrated,
changes in fair value are recognised under the item
Finance income and expense in the statement of profit
or loss.
When the hedging instrument is sold or expires, or when
the transaction no longer meets the effectiveness
criterion, the cumulative gains or losses previously
recognised in equity remain there. This amount is
amortised over the original term, unless there is no longer
an expectation that the hedged future interest and
currency payments will occur. In that case, the
above-mentioned cumulative gains and losses will be
immediately recognised in the statement of profit or loss
as a component of finance income and expense.

(8) Revenue
(8a) Sales of goods - mainly residential
property and land
Revenues from the sales of goods - mainly residential
property and land - are carried at the fair value of the
payment received or due to be received. Revenues from
the sales of goods are recognised in the statement of
profit or loss if the significant risks and rewards of
ownership have been transferred to the buyer, it is
probable that the amount receivable will be collected, the
associated costs can be reliably estimated, there is no
continued management involvement with the goods and
the amount of the revenues can be reliably determined.
The transfer of risks and rewards varies depending on the
conditions in the associated sales contract. The sale of
residential construction projects generally involves the
transfer of risks and rewards when the purchase or
contracting agreement is signed, and subsequently in
proportion to progress with the construction work.
Revenues from these residential construction projects are
recognised in the statement of profit or loss in proportion
to the extent of project completion (see accounting policy
15b). Expected losses are recognised immediately in the
statement of profit or loss.

(8b) Work in progress - projects
The revenue and costs agreed in relation to work in
progress are recognised in the statement of profit or loss
in proportion to the stage of completion of the project.
The stage of completion is assessed by reference to the
proportion of costs recorded in relation to the total
expected costs. If the results from a contract cannot be
determined reliably, contract revenue is only recognised
insofar as it is probable that the costs incurred can be
covered by revenue. Expected project losses are recognised immediately in the statement of profit or loss.
Revenue from additional work is included in the overall
contract revenue if the client has accepted the sum
involved in any way. Claims and incentives are recognised in the amount for work in progress where it is
probable that they will lead to revenue and can be
reliably measured.

(8c) Rental income
Rental income from an investment property is recognised
in the statement of profit or loss in proportion to the term
of the lease.

Accounting principles

(8d) PPP contracts

(10e) Finance income and expense

Revenues from Public-Private Partnership (PPP) contracts
concern revenues from construction and operation.
Revenues from construction are recognised in the same
way as revenues from work in progress (see accounting
policy 8b). Revenues from operations are recognised
when the related services are delivered.

Net financing costs comprise interest payable on
borrowings and finance lease commitments, dividends on
cumulative preference shares B, interest receivable on
funds invested, dividend income, and foreign currency
exchange gains and losses, as well as gains and losses on
hedging instruments that are recognised in the statement
of profit or loss (see accounting policy 7).

(8e) Services
Revenues from services are recognised in the statement of
profit or loss in proportion to the stage of completion of
the transaction on the reporting date. The stage of
completion is determined from assessments of the work
already carried out.

Financing expenses that can be directly allocated to the
acquisition, construction or production of an asset are
capitalised as part of the costs of that asset during the
period that the asset is under development.

(9) Other operating income

The interest component of a finance lease payment is
recognised in the statement of profit or loss and is
calculated using the effective interest method.

Grants

(11) Income tax

Grants that compensate the Group for expenses incurred
are always recognised as revenue in the statement of
profit or loss in the same period in which the corresponding expenses are recognised.

(10) Expenses
(10a) Selling expenses
Costs of sales are the costs of sales that are not charged to
projects.

(10b) Administrative expenses
The administrative expenses represent general expenses
that are not costs of sales and are not charged to projects.

(10c) Lease payments under operating leases
Lease payments made under operating leases are
recognised in the statement of profit or loss, evenly
spread over the term of the lease.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for
temporary differences between the carrying amounts of
assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes, and
the values used for taxation purposes. A deferred tax asset
or liability is not recognised for non-deductible goodwill,
assets and liabilities whose initial recognition does not
affect accounting or taxable profit, or differences relating
to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that these will
probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The
amount of the deferred tax assets and liabilities is based
on the manner in which the expected asset and liability
carrying amounts will be realised or settled, based on the
income tax rates that have been enacted or substantively
enacted on the closing date.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are set off against each
other if there is a right enforceable by law to set them off,
and if these tax assets and liabilities are associated with
income tax levied by the same tax authority on the same
taxable entity, or on different taxable entities that intend
to set them off or that will be realising the tax assets at
the same time as the tax liabilities.

(10d) Lease payments under finance leases
Lease payments made under finance leases are apportioned between the finance expense and the reduction of
the outstanding liability. The finance expense is allocated
to each period during the total lease term so as to
produce a constant periodic rate of interest over the
remaining term of the liability.

144

Annual Report 2017 - Heijmans

Income tax recognised in the statement of profit or loss
during the financial year comprises the income tax owed
or refundable over the reporting period and the deferred
income tax. The income tax is recognised in the statement
of profit or loss, except to the extent that it relates to items
recognised in other comprehensive income. In that case,
the relevant portion of the income tax is recognised in
other comprehensive income.
The income tax owed or refundable over the financial year

is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the
financial year, using tax rates enacted or substantively
enacted on the closing date, as well adjustments to tax
payable in respect of previous years.
A deferred tax asset (net of any deferred tax liability) is
recognised only to the extent that it is probable that
future taxable profits will be available that can be utilised
towards realising the deferred asset. The amount of the
deferred tax asset is reduced to the extent that it is no
longer probable that the related tax benefit will be
realised.
Additional income tax that arises from the distribution of
dividends is recognised at the same time as the liability to
pay the related dividend is recognised.

(12) Property, plant and equipment
(12a) Assets in ownership
Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at
cost or estimated cost less accumulated depreciation (see
below) and impairments (see accounting policy 20). Cost
includes costs that can be directly allocated to the
acquisition of the asset. The cost of self-constructed assets
includes the cost of materials, direct labour costs,
financing costs and any other costs that can be directly
allocated to making the asset ready for use, as well as
any costs of dismantling and removing the asset and
restoring the site where the asset is located. The costs of
self-constructed assets and acquired assets include (i) the
initial estimate at the time of installation of the costs of
dismantling and removing the assets and restoring the
site on which the assets are located and (ii) changes in the
measurement of existing liabilities recognised in relation
to the costs identified in (i) above.
If elements of an item of property, plant or equipment
have different useful lives, the component method is
applied.

(12b) Leased assets
Leases for which the Group takes on nearly all the risks
and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
The leased asset is stated at an amount equal to the lower
of its fair value and the present value of the minimum
lease payments at the inception of the lease, less
accumulated depreciation (see below) and impairments
(see accounting policy 20).

(12c) Expenses after initial recognition
The Group includes the cost of replacing part of an asset
in the carrying amount of items of property, plant and
equipment when the cost is incurred. This occurs if it is
likely that the future economic benefits of the asset will
accrue to the Group and the cost price of the asset can be
reliably determined. All other expenses are taken to the
statement of profit or loss when these are incurred.

(12d) Depreciation of property, plant and
equipment
Depreciation is recognised in the statement of profit or
loss using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful life of each part of an item of property, plant or
equipment. The residual values are reassessed on an
annual basis. Depreciation is not applied to land. The
estimated useful lives are as follows:
• Buildings: main building structures and roofs:
30 years
• Buildings: technical equipment: 15 years
• Buildings: interior walls: 10 years
• Office equipment: 3 - 10 years
• Machines: 5 - 10 years
• Installations: 5 - 10 years
• Large-scale equipment and other capital assets: 3 - 10
years

(12e) Investment property
Given its marginal importance, investment property
(property held for its rental income and/or increase in
value) is recognised under property, plant and equipment.
Investment property is measured at cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Cost includes
costs that can be directly allocated to the acquisition of
the asset. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the
cost of materials, direct labour costs, financing costs and
any other costs that can be directly allocated to making
the asset ready for use, as well as any costs of dismantling and removing the asset and restoring the site where
the asset is located. Rental income from investment
property is accounted for as described in principle 8.

(13) Intangible assets
(13a) Goodwill
All business combinations are recognised using the
acquisition method. Goodwill is the amount that arises
from the acquisition of subsidiaries. Goodwill represents
the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the net fair

value of the identifiable assets and liabilities at the time
of acquisition. An impairment test is carried out every
year (see accounting policy 20).

(15b) Residential property in preparation
or under construction
Sold

Negative goodwill arising from an acquisition is recognised directly in the statement of profit or loss.

(13b) Other intangible assets
The intangible assets acquired by the Group that have
finite useful lives are measured at cost less accumulated
depreciation and accumulated impairments.

(13c) Amortisation
Regarding goodwill, an impairment test is systematically
performed every year at the closing date to determine
whether there are any impairments. The other intangible
assets are amortised through the statement of profit or
loss on a straight-line basis over the expected useful lives
of the intangible assets, and undergo periodic impairment
testing (see accounting policy 20). The estimated useful
lives of the intangible asset categories are as follows:
• Customer base: 5 - 20 years
• Order book: 4 years
• Sand quarry concession: 5 - 15 years
• Brand: 5 - 10 years

(13d) Expenses after initial recognition
Expenditure on intangible assets, other than goodwill, is
only capitalised after initial recognition if it is expected to
increase the future economic benefits that are inherent in
the specific asset to which the expenditure relates. All
other items of expenditure are recognised as costs in the
statement of profit or loss when these are incurred.

(14) Other investments
Other investments are measured at amortised cost using
the effective interest method, less impairments.

(15) Inventories
(15a) Strategic land portfolio
The strategic land portfolio represents the reported land
holdings that are managed centrally in the Company’s
strategic land portfolio. These holdings are acquired and
held for future property development. The interest and
development costs for land portfolios that are under
development are capitalised. Land and holdings are
measured at cost or net realisable value if lower.

146

Annual Report 2017 - Heijmans

Residential construction projects where the buyer only
has limited influence on the main elements in the design
of the assets are recognised under inventory. Contracts
with buyers concern purchase/contracting agreements
that have been formulated in a way that the land is
initially bought after which the building is constructed.
By accession, everything that is built on the land is the
property of the purchaser. Moreover, the purchase price is
fixed in advance, so that the economic risk of an increase
or decrease in value is borne by the buyer. The transfer of
risks and benefits therefore occurs continually during the
progress of the project. Revenue and results are thus
accounted for in proportion to project progress - in
accordance with IFRIC 15 - and measured in the same
way as for construction work in progress (see accounting
policy 16). Progress is measured according to billing
progress, as this is linked to previously established
phases.

Unsold
Unsold residential properties in preparation and under
construction are measured at cost, or at net recoverable
value if lower. The net realisable value is the estimated
selling price in the ordinary course of business less the
estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs
necessary to make the sale. Development and construction rights are also recognised under residential property
in preparation or under construction.

(15c) Other inventories
Other inventories includes land and premises for sale, raw
materials and consumables, inventories in production
and finished products.
Inventories is measured at cost, or at net realisable value
if lower. The net realisable value is the estimated selling
price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated
costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to
make the sale. The cost of inventories is based on the
first-in, first-out (FIFO) principle, and includes expenditure
incurred in acquiring the inventories, the production or
conversion costs, and the other costs incurred in bringing
the inventories to its current location and current
condition. The cost of inventories includes an appropriate
share of production overheads based on normal operating
capacity, as well as the attributable financing expenses.
Land and property held for sale are also recognised under
inventories. This concerns land and premises that have

been technically delivered as developed but which on the
closing date were not sold to third parties. The inventories
of land and premises for sale is valued at cost (including
interest and allocated overhead costs), less any writedowns relating to a lower net realisable value as a
consequence of the risk of inability to sell or rent.

(16) Work in progress
Construction work in progress concerns projects commissioned by third parties. These are measured at cost plus
profit recognised to date (see also accounting policy 8), in
proportion to the progress of the project, less expected
losses and invoiced instalments. Total expected project
losses, if any, are directly recognised as expenses in the
relevant period. Cost includes all costs that relate directly
to the projects.
Revenue from additional work is included in the overall
contract revenue if the client has accepted the sum
involved in any way. Claims and incentives are recognised in the amount for work in progress where it is
probable that they will lead to revenue and can be
reliably measured.
Interest and development costs for construction work in
progress are only capitalised if the asset is under
construction. If no construction activities are carried out
over an extended period, the interest and development
costs are no longer capitalised.
The preparation costs and the design and development
costs of major projects are capitalised as work in progress
if the following conditions are met:
• the costs can be separately identified;
• the costs can be reliably determined;
• it is probable that the project will be awarded; and
• there is no longer any competition as regards the
awarding of the project.
If any of these requirements is not fulfilled, the costs are
charged to the result for the period in which they are
incurred. Costs, once expensed in the statement of profit
or loss in the period in which they are incurred, are not
subsequently capitalised if the project is awarded.
The profit capitalised on work in progress is based on the
estimated final result, taking into account the percentage
of progress on this specific work. The progress percentage is
calculated as the ratio between the costs incurred to date
and the total expected costs, on a project-by-project basis.

(17) Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are estimated at amortised
cost less impairment losses due to the risk of
non-collection.

(18) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and bank
balances and other call deposits with an original term of
a maximum of three months. Current account overdrafts
that are repayable on demand and form an integral part
of the Group’s cash management are included as a
component of cash and cash equivalents in the statement
of cash flows.

(19) Assets held for sale and discontinued
operations
Non-current assets (or groups of assets and liabilities that
are to be disposed of), for which it is expected that the
carrying amount will probably be realised within one
year mainly by means of a sale transaction and not
through continued use, are classified as held for sale (or
held for distribution), after it is established that the
relevant conditions have been met. Immediately
preceding this classification, the assets (or the components of a group of assets to be disposed of) are measured
again in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies.
The assets or group of assets to be disposed of are
generally measured at the carrying amount or the fair
value less sale costs, if lower. Any impairment loss on a
group of assets held for sale is first allocated to goodwill
and then pro rata to the remaining assets and liabilities,
subject to the restriction that impairment losses are not
allocated to inventories, financial assets, deferred tax
assets or employee benefits, all of which are measured in
accordance with the Group’s accounting policies.
Impairment losses arising from the initial classification as
held for sale or distribution and gains or losses on
revaluation arising after initial recognition are recognised
in the statement of profit or loss. If the gain concerned
exceeds the accumulated impairment loss, the difference
is not recognised.
A discontinued operation is an element of the Group’s
operations that represents a separate significant business
activity or separate significant geographical business area
that has been disposed of or is held for sale or distribution, or a subsidiary that has been acquired solely for the
purpose of resale. Classification as a discontinued
operation occurs upon disposal, or when the operation
meets the criteria for classification as held for sale, if

earlier. If an operation is designated as a discontinued
operation, the comparative figures in the statement of
profit or loss have been restated as if the operation had
been discontinued from the beginning of the comparative
period.

In respect of other assets, impairments recognised in
other periods are reversed if there is an indication that the
impairment no longer exists or has decreased and if there
has been a change in the estimates used to determine the
recoverable amount.

(20) Impairments

An impairment is reversed only to the extent that the
asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying
amount that would have been determined, net of
depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment had been
recognised.

The carrying amounts of the Group’s assets, excluding
work in progress (see accounting policy 16), inventories
(see accounting policy 15) and deferred tax assets (see
accounting policy 11), are reviewed each closing date to
determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If there are such indications, an estimate is made of the
recoverable amount of the asset concerned.

(21a) Costs of issuing ordinary shares

For goodwill, intangible assets with an unlimited useful
life, and intangible assets that are not yet ready for use,
the recoverable amount is estimated at the closing date.

Costs directly attributable to the issuing of ordinary
shares are charged to equity, after deduction of any tax
effects.

An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying
amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its
recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in
the statement of profit or loss.

(21b) Repurchase of own shares

Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount
of any goodwill allocated to the units, and then to reduce
the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit (or
group of units) on a pro rata basis.

(20a) Determination of recoverable amount
The recoverable amount of an asset is equal to the higher
of its net selling price and its value in use. To determine
the value in use, the discounted value of the estimated
future cash flows is calculated using a discount rate that
reflects current market rates as well as the specific risks
associated with the asset. For any asset that does not
generate cash inflows and is largely independent of other
assets, the recoverable amount is determined on the basis
of its cash-generating unit.

If shares representing capital that is recognised as equity
in the balance are repurchased, the amount of the
consideration paid, including directly attributable costs, is
recognised as a deduction from equity. Repurchased
shares are classified as treasury shares and are presented
as a deduction from total equity.

(21c) Dividends
Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in
which these are declared.

(22) Interest-bearing loans
(22a) Financing of preference share capital
Preference share capital is classified as a liability because
the dividend payments are not discretionary. Dividends
on preference share capital are recognised as interest
expense in the statement of profit or loss.

(20b) Reversal of impairments

(22b) Loans

An impairment loss relating to securities held to maturity
or assets measured at amortised cost is reversed if the
increase in fair value subsequent to recognition of the
loss can be objectively linked to an event that occurred
after the impairment loss was recognised.

Interest-bearing loans are initially recognised at fair value
less attributable transaction costs. Any difference between
the amortised cost and the redemption amount calculated by the effective interest method is recognised in the
statement of profit or loss over the term of each such loan.

Impairment losses in respect of goodwill are never
reversed.

(23) Employee benefits
(23a) Defined contribution plans
Commitments for contributions to defined-contribution
pension plans are recognised as an expense in the
statement of profit or loss when they are due.

(23b) Defined benefit plans
The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit
pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by
estimating the amount of future pension benefit that
employees have earned in return for their service in the
reporting period and in previous periods. The discounted
present value of these pension benefits is determined, and
is reduced by the fair value of the plan assets. The
discount rate is the yield at the closing date on high-quality corporate bonds that have terms to maturity approximately the same as the terms of the Group’s liabilities.
The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using
the projected unit credit method. This method takes into
account future salary increases resulting from employee
career opportunities and general salary increases,
including adjustments for inflation.
If the entitlements under a plan are changed, or a plan is
curtailed, the resulting change in entitlements relating to
past service, or the gain or loss on the closure, as the case
may be, is recognised directly in the statement of profit or
loss.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised directly as other
comprehensive income that will never be reclassified to
the statement of profit or loss.

present value. The discount rate is the yield at the closing
date on high-quality corporate bonds that have terms to
maturity approximately the same as the terms of the
Group’s liabilities. Actuarial gains and losses on these
benefits are recognised in the statement of profit or loss.

(23d) Severance payments
Severance payments are recognised as an expense if the
Group has shown that it is committed to terminating the
employment contract of an employee or group of
employees before the normal retirement date, by
producing a detailed, formal plan, without there being a
realistic option of the plan being withdrawn.

(24) Provisions
A provision is recognised in the statement of financial
position if the Group has a present legal or actual liability
that is the result of a past event and it is probable that its
settlement will require an outflow of funds. Provisions are
determined by discounting the expected future cash flows
at a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market
assessments of the time value of money and, where
necessary, the risks specific to the liability. The accrued
interest on provisions is treated as a financing charge.

(24a) Warranties
A provision for warranties is recognised after the underlying products or services have been sold and delivered. The
provision is made for costs that must be incurred to
correct deficiencies that appear after delivery but during
the warranty period.

(24b) Restructuring
If the result of the calculation is a potential asset for the
Group, recognition of the asset is limited to the present
value of the economic benefits available as possible
future refunds from the plan or lower future contributions. When calculating the present value of the economic
benefits, possible minimum financing obligations that
apply are taken into account.

(23c) Long-term employee benefits
The Group’s net liability in respect of long-term employee
benefits, other than pension plans, is the amount of
future benefits that employees have accrued in return for
their service in the reporting period and in previous
periods, such as long-service payments, bonuses and
incentives. The liability is calculated using the projected
unit credit method and is discounted to determine its

A restructuring provision is recognised (i) when the Group
has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan
and (ii) the restructuring has either commenced or been
publicly announced.

(24c) Environment
A provision for restoration of contaminated land is formed
in accordance with the Group’s environmental policy and
applicable legal requirements.

(24d) Onerous contracts
A provision for onerous contracts is recognised if the
benefits that the Group expects to receive from a contract
are lower than the unavoidable costs of meeting the

contractual obligations. Provisions are valued at the lower
of the present value of the expected costs of terminating
the contract and the present value of the expected net
costs of continuing the contract. Where appropriate, the
Group recognises impairment losses on any assets
associated with the contract prior to forming the
provision.

(25) Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are recognised at amortised cost.

(26) Statement of cash flows
The statement of cash flows is prepared using the indirect
method. The liquidity item in the statement of cash flows
comprises cash and cash equivalents after deduction of
current-account overdrafts that are repayable on demand.

(27) Segment reporting
A segment is a clearly distinguishable operation of the
Group. The segments are identified in accordance with the
classification used by the Executive Board when taking
operational decisions. The Group distinguishes the
following segments: Property Development, Residential
Building, Non-Residential, and Infrastructure. Residential
and Non-Residential Building will be brought under unified
control and integrated in the course of 2018 into a new
segment of Building & Technology (Dutch name: Bouw &

With underlying EBITDA, the Group is referring to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (equal to the
operating result before depreciation/amortisation) adjusted for the EBITDA from joint ventures, property write-downs,
reorganisation costs, gains and losses on the sale of entities, impairment losses on goodwill and other non-operating
results considered exceptional by the Group that are relevant in the above statement. The soil remediation costs in 2017
relate to industrial sites sold off as part of the restructuring. The underlying EBITDA is also used as the basis for calculation
for covenant reporting to the bank consortium.

On 17 January 2017, Heijmans sold its subsidiary Franki to PORR Deutschland GmbH. The purchase price of €14 million
was paid in cash on 16 January 2017. In 2016, Franki generated a result after tax of approximately €0.4 million (before
write-downs of goodwill and property, plant and equipment). The book loss of €6.1 million connected with this disposal was
recognised in 2016. €2.0 million of the loss was treated as an impairment of intangible assets and €4.1 million as an
impairment of property, plant and equipment, before being reclassified under assets held for sale. The amount of cash
included in the sale was nil.
On 25 April 2017, Heijmans sold all the shares of its Belgian companies Heijmans Bouw, Heijmans Infra, Van den Berg and
Heijmans (B) NV to BESIX. The net cash proceeds for Heijmans (selling price of €95 million less cash of €55 million included
in the sale) amounted to €40 million. The book profit on the disposal was €14 million. In the period prior to the date of
disposal, these Belgian entities generated a combined result after tax of €0.5 million.
On 21 April 2017, Heijmans sold all the shares of Heijmans Oevermann GmbH to PORR Deutschland GmbH. The net cash
proceeds for Heijmans (selling price of €58 million less cash of €15 million included in the sale) amounted to approximately €43 million. The book profit on the disposal was €17 million. In the period prior to the date of disposal, Oevermann
reported a loss after tax in 2017 of approximately €2.5 million.
In the statement of profit or loss, the above results on disposal have been accounted for in discontinued operations.
As at year-end 2016, the entities were recognised in the statement of financial position as assets and liabilities held for sale.
The cash flows from discontinued operations (in 2017 up to the date of disposal) amounted to:

The cumulative finance expense for 2017 amounts to €9.1 million, which is €0.3 million higher than the €8.8 million for
2016.
The interest and development costs for land portfolios that are under development are capitalised. The interest rate used for
determining the financing costs to be capitalised is 4.20% for 2017 (2016: 4.20%).
The finance expense in 2017 includes the reversal of an impairment loss previously recognised on an outstanding loan to a
previously sold associate.
The average interest rate in 2017 was higher than in 2016, primarily as a consequence of the increased interest margin on
the syndicate loan contracted as part of the refinancing operation at the start of 2017. The effect was mitigated by a
reduction in the average level of debt, chiefly as a consequence of the disposal of entities outside the Netherlands. For a
summary of the interest rates, see note 6.20.

Other mainly refers to the cash-generating unit Infrastructure (€15 million).
For further details on the impairment of assets held for sale in 2016, refer to note 6.2.
The remaining amortisation term for the intangible asset that was part of the Burgers Ergon acquisition is 9 years.
The remaining intangible assets of the other acquisitions relate mainly to concessions for sand quarries. The amortisation
of the other intangible assets is recognised in the statement of profit or loss under other operating expenses. Goodwill is
tested annually for impairment, based on the relevant cash-generating unit. For an explanation of the calculation of the
recoverable amount, reference is made to the accounting policies.
The impairment tests are based on the value in use calculated by means of the discounted cash flow method. The pre-tax
WACC (weighted average cost of capital) used for this calculation was around 12% as in the preceding year, corresponding to
a discount rate after tax of 9.5% (2016: 9.7%).
The value in use of the cash-flow generating business units is based on their expected future cash flows. The period adopted
to determine the present value of cash flows is indefinite. In the determination of future cash flows, the medium to longterm planning for the relevant cash-flow generating unit is used. The assumptions underlying the medium to long-term
planning are partly based on historical experience and external information sources. The medium to long-term planning
generally covers a period of 5 years. Cash flows after 5 years are extrapolated using a growth rate of 1.5% (2016: 1.5%).
The recoverable amount calculated for the impairment test depends on the growth rate used and the period over which the
cash flows are realised. Other important variables are the expected of revenue growth, probable margins and working capital
requirements.
The expected cash flows are discounted using a pre-tax WACC of around 12%. If the pre-tax WACC were 1 percentage point
higher, this would not result in an impairment. Cash flows after five years are extrapolated using growth rates not exceeding
1.5%. If this maximum were 1 percentage point lower, this would not result in an impairment.

x € 1.000
The cash-flow generating unit Non-Residential - to which the goodwill and other intangible assets of Burgers Ergon and the
majority of the goodwill for IBC is allocated, totalling €60 million (2016: €61 million) - is sensitive to changes in the
assumptions, with the possibility that the recoverable amount could become lower than the carrying amount of €58
million (2016: €45 million). According to the impairment test, the recoverable amount of the cash-flow generating unit
Non-Residential is currently some €20 million (2016: €50 million) higher than the carrying amount. One significant factor
in this context is the change in the EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) margin. For the purposes of the test, revenue has
been assumed to rise to a level of around €430 million in 2020 (2017: €241 million actual revenue), partly on the back of
developments providing mass-produced affordable housing. A key assumption is that the EBIT margin grows to 1.9% (2016:
4.0%) of revenue. If the EBIT margin is only 1.2% (2016: 2.0% , the recoverable amount is equal to the carrying amount.

Together with 3i Investments plc. (formerly Barclays Infrastructure Funds Management), Heijmans has been participating
since June 2013 in the joint venture Heijmans Capital B.V. for the financing of DBFMO (design, build, finance, maintain,
operate) projects. The focus of the collaboration is on sharing the risk-bearing capital and knowledge required for such
projects, from the tendering phase onwards. The project for the National Military Museum was transferred to the joint
venture at the time of establishment. In 2014, Heijmans took on part of the funding for the projects A9-Gaasperdammerweg,
RIVM-Utrecht Science Park/De Uithof and A12-Veenendaal-Ede-Grijsoord. Then in 2016, Heijmans also took on part of the
funding of the A27/ A1 Hart van Zuid projects. The share of 3i Investments plc. in Heijmans Capital B.V is 80% and
Heijmans’ share in the company is 20% (2016: 20%).
The figures presented below were extracted from the financial statements of Heijmans Capital, prepared in accordance with
the Group’s accounting policies. Also shown below is the reconciliation of the Group’s interest with equity.

Measurement of deferred tax assets
At year-end 2017, the recognised loss carry forward was €35.6 million, which relates to the loss carryforward of the Dutch
tax group. This loss carryforward has been set off against the tax group’s deferred tax liabilities.
The losses of the Dutch tax group are subject to a loss carryforward period of 9 years. A deferred tax asset is recognised to
the extent that it is probable, based on forecasts, that sufficient future taxable profits will be available that can be utilised
towards realising the deferred asset. A relatively small number of large problem projects produces the losses, Measures
have been taken to prevent such losses. Most of the activities perform according to plan. The forecasts are based on the order
book, the 2018 business plan, and the long-term forecast. These also underlie the measurement of the recoverable amount
of goodwill (for impairment tests). For the long-term forecast, the average EBIT margin of the Dutch tax group is assumed to
grow to approximately 3% of revenue. The remaining settlement term of 9 years is longer than the period currently used
until 2022. A factor inherent in the measurement of the deferred tax assets is that the utilisation of losses depends on the
realisation of the 2018 business plan and the long-term forecasts, which are the Group’s best estimates. Based on the
projected results for the years 2018–2022 and the current tax rate of 25%, there will be sufficient taxable profits over the
next few years to enable the tax asset recognised as at 31 December 2017 to be realised.

Measurement of deferred tax liabilities
For determining the amount of the deferred tax liabilities, the value for tax purposes of the construction work in progress in
the Netherlands (including residential building projects) is largely treated as being equal to the value under IFRS.
Deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised for any temporary differences originating at subsidiaries, joint operations or
joint ventures. No deferred tax assets or liabilities have been recognised for temporary differences arising from investments
in associates in view of their relative insignificance.
The majority of the deferred tax liabilities have a term of more than one year.

Tax losses not recognised in the statement of financial position
At year-end 2017, the tax-deductible losses of the Heijmans NV tax group amounted to €261.3 million (2016: €266.3
million). An analysis of this figure shows that €44.9 million relates to 2012, €69.6 million to 2014, €43.0 million to 2015,
and €103.8 million to 2016. Out of the total, €119 million has not been recognised. At year-end 2017, the other tax losses
not recognised in the statement of financial position amounted to €40.9 million (2016: €41.3 million). This relates to one
German and two Belgian subsidiaries that conduct no operations.

Strategic land portfolio
The strategic land portfolio comprises land holdings that are measured at cost or net realisable value if lower. The net
realisable value of these holdings may be either the direct realisable value or the indirect realisable value. The recognised
net realisable value depends on the expected manner and time horizon of realisation and in most cases, therefore, is
measured using an indirect realisable value method. The indirect realisable value is the estimated selling price in the
ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale, the
expected cash flows usually being discounted to net present value using a discount rate of 6% unless a different rate has
been agreed, for example on the basis of favourable financing arrangements available within a joint undertaking. In fixing
the discount rate, account is taken of the expected capital structure, operational risks and specific circumstances affecting
Heijmans or the project concerned.
Determining the indirect realisable value involves the use of judgements and estimates. The strategic land portfolio is
affected by several elements of uncertainty, such as demographic changes, location, and details and implementation of
development plans and administrative decisions, with as local a focus as possible. For each site, this results in projections
for land and house prices and for other variables that ultimately have a bearing on the indirect realisable value. The Group
makes a comprehensive internal assessment of the value of its land holdings twice a year.

In general, the risk of deviations from the judgements and estimates is greater for strategic land holdings without planning
permission than for those with. Moreover, this risk keeps increasing the longer the expected delay is before the start of
development.
The net realisable value of the strategic land portfolio was calculated in 2017 and compared with the carrying amount. This
led to a write-down of €5.2 million and a write-down of €1.0 million concerning a joint venture (2016: write-downs totalling
€17.6 million and a reversal of an earlier write-down of €1.2 million concerning a joint venture). The decreases in value are
partly due to specific local conditions that have adversely affected the success of projects, time to completion, expected
margins and the number of homes completed.
In principle, the term of the strategic land portfolio is more than 12 months after the closing date (mostly 5 to 10 years).
Residential property in preparation or under construction usually has a term of 3 to 5 years as from the closing date.
The other items in principle have a term of less than 12 months.

Balance of work in progress

A periodical assessment of the carrying amount of work in progress is made for each project by the project owner and the
management of the unit concerned. This assessment is essentially performed on the basis of the figures in the project files,
the project accounts and the knowledge and experience of those involved. Inherent in this process and the project-related
activities is that estimates have to be made and that the Group is involved in negotiations and discussions concerning the
financial progress of projects, such as contract savings or extras, claims, incentives and penalties, completion dates and the
quality standard of the work. It may turn out at a later stage that actual results differ from the estimates. This will be so
particularly for long-term projects that include considerable customisation. It can also occur if there are unsettled claims or
discussions with clients about additional work that are still continuing on the closing date. For further details on a number
of specific projects, refer to note 6.29.
The degree of uncertainty surrounding these estimates becomes greater the more, for example:
• types of contract and associated specific agreements involve increased risks for the Group. In a DC contract, for example,
the Group assumes the design risk (as well as construction). DBMO contracts also include responsibility for maintenance
and operation;
• projects are still at the design stage. It is possible for substantial changes to occur in the process of turning a provisional
design into the final design, leading to adjustments both up and down compared with the initial projection.
For example there may be extra work, claims or unforeseen circumstances with a potential cost to the Group. For example
there may be extra work, claims or unforeseen circumstances with a potential cost to the Group.
Revenue from additional work is included in the overall contract revenue if the client has accepted the sum involved in any
way. Claims and incentives are recognised in the amount for work in progress where it is probable that they will lead to
revenue and can be reliably measured. In determining the amount to be recognised, account is taken of specific contractual
agreements and the legal framework in the country where the project is being carried out.

For claims and penalties imposed by contractors against Heijmans, because of construction overruns for example, are
recognised if it is likely that they will have an adverse effect.
Bonuses are recognised as revenue from work in progress if the project is far enough advanced and it is probable that the
performance indicators specified will be met, and the bonus amount can be reliably determined. If the bonus can only be
received after expiry of a predetermined period following completion of the project, then that bonus is only recognised when
it is sufficiently probable that the bonus will be received.

Cumulative financing preference shares
At year-end 2017, 4,510,000 cumulative financing preference shares B were outstanding at €10 a share. The annual amount
of the interest payable on these shares, with effect from 1 January 2014, is 7.9% and is payable annually, 14 days after the
General Meeting of Shareholders. The dividend will be reviewed on 1 January 2019 and every 5 years thereafter. The Group
has the right to repurchase or cancel these preference shares before their maturity date in case of an interest rate change or
at any other time subject to payment of compensation. There is no repayment obligation.

Syndicated bank financing
The total committed amount of the syndicated bank facility as at year-end 2017 was €155.9 million. This facility was
refinanced at the start of 2017 with a maturity date of 30 June 2019. Efforts made to achieve more robust balance sheet
ratios, resulting in a gradual reduction in the facility from €256 million to €122 million by mid-2019 (year-end 2018: €145
million). With the disposal of the operations outside the Netherlands and the improvement in the cash flow from operating
activities, the Group was able to bring about a reduction in the facility to the current figure of €155.9 million by the end of
October 2017, which was eight months ahead of the agreed schedule. On 31 March 2017, Deutsche Bank left the syndicate
as planned, and it has since been made up of Rabobank, ING Bank, ABN AMRO Bank and KBC. The further reduction in the
facility to €122 million anticipates the agreed exit of KBC from the banking syndicate as from mid-2019.
The interest rate payable to the banking syndicate is 4%. A cut in the interest rate to 3% comes into effect as soon as the
amount of the facility has been reduced to €125 million. Collateral security has been provided for the facility. This is
predominantly in the form of pledging of trade receivables and bank balances as well as a first mortgage on land holdings
recognised at a combined carrying amount of approximately €75 million.
As a consequence of the substantial project losses incurred in Q4 2016, a different regime was applicable in 2017 for testing
compliance with the financial covenants. As regards the tests as at 30 June 2017, 30 September 2017 and 31 December
2017, minimum levels for EBITDA and solvency were agreed. The applicable minimum EBITDA (cumulative as from 1
January 2017) was €0 million for the first half of 2017, €5 million for the first three quarters of 2017 and €20 million for the
whole of 2017. The solvency ratio minimums were 16% on 30 June 2017, 18% on 30 September 2017 and 20% on 31
December 2017. The solvency ratio calculation involves dividing the capital base by total assets, the capital base being
made up of equity plus the cumulative financing preference shares B. Heijmans operated within the agreed covenants
throughout the year. With the disposal of the non-Dutch businesses, which produced a book profit and a reduction in the
size of the balance sheet, there was a structural improvement in the solvency ratio of approximately 10 percentage points,
meaning that the agreed levels were comfortably achieved.
From 2018 onwards, the financial covenants from prior to 2017 become effective again and, if they are not satisfied, the
facility can in principle be called in immediately. This concerns an interest cover ratio of a minimum of level 4, to be
complied with at the end of each quarter, a senior debt cover ratio of a maximum of 3 on a six monthly basis and an average
leverage ratio of a maximum of 2.5, to be complied with quarterly as from 30 June 2018. Satisfying the covenants is actively
monitored within Heijmans. Based on the 2018 business plan, together with the already achieved quarterly figures during
2017, the Group expects to be able to continue operating within the covenants in the year ahead, the relevant parameters
here being the development in EBITDA and net debt. Changes in the net debt position are a function of fluctuations in
working capital, behind which lie seasonal effects and fluctuations due to specific projects in particular. During the course of
the year, the working capital requirement is traditionally higher than at year-end, leading to an increase in net debt by as

much as €50-100 million. The syndicated loan, which was not drawn on at all as at year-end 2017, is available to fund
fluctuations in working capital.
The leverage ratio is obtained by dividing net debt by EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation).
The interest cover ratio is calculated as EBITDA divided by net interest expense. The definitions of these items include several
adjustments to the reported figures, as agreed with the bank consortium in the credit agreement. The main adjustments
compared with the net debt for accounting purposes are an increase in respect of the net debt from joint ventures and a
decrease in respect of the amount of the cumulative financing preference shares B in issue and certain specific project
financing arrangements where there is no right of recourse against Heijmans. The main adjustments compared with the
accounting EBITDA concern the capitalised interest, results relating to business units that have been sold off, fair value
adjustments, reorganisation costs and EBITDA results from joint ventures. The main adjustments to the reported net
interest expense concern the exclusion of interest expense on non-recourse project financing and cumulative financing B
preference shares.
		
Reconciliation between the underlying results, EBITDA, net debt and net interest expense as reported and in accordance
with the definitions agreed with the bank consortium, and the calculation of the 2018 ratios, is presented below. As can be
seen, Heijmans would already have satisfied the financial covenants applicable with effect from 31 March 2018 at year-end
2017.

Project financing
Project financing arrangements have been entered into in connection with specific real estate and other projects. The project
financing repayment schedules are usually related to the progress on projects. Project financing generally expires no later
than the date of completion and/or sale of the projects. Recourse is limited to project assets only, including future positive
cash flows from these projects, as well as the contracts and mortgage collateral related to the project / project company in
most cases. Heijmans N.V. has guaranteed the repayment of principal and/or payment of interest up to an amount of €0.3
million (2016: €0.6 million) of the total project financing. Heijmans N.V. and its group companies did not have any nonrecourse financing arrangements (2016: €0.4 million).

Other liabilities
The other liabilities concern financing arrangements provided by parties involved in a number of specific investments in
land. As security for this finance, amounting to €14.2 million (2016: €22.0 million), Heijmans has provided guarantees in
respect of repayments/payment of interest.

The employee-related receivable concerns a plan that, in accordance with the Pensions Act funding rules as specified in the
Financial Assessment Framework, has a policy funding ratio of 102.6% (2016: 99.4%). (See Stichting Pensioenfonds
Heijmans N.V. below.) The receivable is based on the assumption that this plan, which is now closed, will gradually wind
down, and on the conclusion that the Group, as the employer, will eventually be the sole remaining stakeholder and
therefore logically entitled to the final balance. However, it is expected that new IFRS rules (a proposed amendment to IFRIC
14 not yet issued, curtailing refunds from a defined benefit plan) could lead to this asset ceasing to be recognised. The
pension fund trustees and the Group are currently engaged in discussions regarding reinsurance of either part or all of the
plan. If it is decided to go ahead with either partial or complete reinsurance, this could mean the amount of the receivable
from the pension plan becomes smaller. In either situation this would, for example, have a negative impact on the Group’s
solvency ratio amounting to several percentage points.

		
Liability for defined benefit plans in the Netherlands						
The liability for defined benefit plans concerns the liabilities recognised for one company pension fund and approximately
15 plans placed with insurance companies.									
			

Stichting Pensioenfonds Heijmans N.V.						
No new members will be admitted to the Pensioenfonds Heijmans plan. Pension rights are currently being accrued at an
insurer on the portion of salary that exceeds the maximum salary threshold of the industry-wide pension fund. This plan
came into effect on 1 January 2012 for new employees. As of 1 January 2013, existing employees have also been accruing
pension rights under this plan. (This concerns employees who have been with the Company since before 1 January 2012
and were accruing supplementary pension rights with Pensioenfonds Heijmans.) The plan is an average pay scheme with
conditional indexation and qualifies as a defined contribution plan. The pension accrual of employees who became
members of the supplementary plan before the end of 2012 remains guaranteed by Stichting Pensioenfonds Heijmans N.V..
While employees stay with Heijmans, the pensions they accrued up to the end of 2012 are subject to conditional annual
increase. Heijmans pays a contribution each year to cover the costs of this. Approximately 23% of the members in the new
plan were members of the former plan who are still employed by Heijmans, and accordingly have a conditional right to
indexation, depending on the salary increase in accordance with the collective employment agreement for the Construction
Industry for a maximum of 4% a year. For the rest, 52% are former employees and 25% are pensioners. The average term of
the pension liabilities is approximately 16 years. Because of the funding deficit in the former plan, Heijmans made an
additional contribution of €5 million in 2012 and a further €3 million in 2013. Heijmans is under no obligation to make

any further contributions. The pension contributions and required buffers are calculated in accordance with the rules stated
in the Pensions Act. In accordance with these rules, the contributions are cost effective, and the funding ratio set by the
pension fund policy needs to be 108% at year-end 2017 (2016: 109%). The actual policy funding ratio as at 31 December
2017 was 102.6%. The pension fund capital is expected to reach the required level by the set date and no further measures
should be necessary. The pensions regulator is De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB), the Dutch central bank. The Board of
Trustees of the fund comprises representatives of the employer, employees and pensioners.

Insured plans						
Heijmans has some 15 insured pension plans in the form of guarantee contracts. Other than the costs of indexation,
Heijmans is not liable for payments due to aggravated mortality assumptions. The risks inherent in the plan of these being
necessary are largely borne by the insurers. It is a responsibility of the insurers to hold sufficient funds to pay out all
benefits. Again, regulatory responsibility lies with DNB. The amount of the additional contribution required to meet annual
increases is calculated on the basis of the assumptions contained in the insurance contract. The average term of the pension
liabilities is approximately 15 years.
						

Industry-wide pension funds
The majority of the pensions have been placed with industry-wide pension funds, the main ones being the Pension Fund for
the Construction Industry (Bouwnijverheid) and the Pension Fund for the Engineering, Mechanical and Electrical
Contracting Sector (Metaal en Techniek). Both these funds operate average pay plans with annual increases. The funding
ratio set by the policy of the Collective Pension Fund for the Construction Industry was 115.2% at year-end 2017 (year-end
2016: 105.4%). The policy funding ratio for the Engineering, Mechanical and Electrical Contracting Sector stood at 100.6% at
year-end 2017 (year-end 2016: 92.8%). These funding ratios have been calculated on the basis of the actuarial assumptions
used by the various industry-wide pension funds, in accordance with the Pensions Act and the Financial Assessment
Framework.
Since their funding ratios have only a marginal effect on the contribution adjustments, these plans qualify as defined
benefit pension plans. Despite this, they are treated as defined contribution plans because the administration of the
industry pension funds is not designed to supply the required information.
With regard to these plans, Heijmans is only required to pay the predetermined contributions. The Group has no obligation
to make up any deficit, other than through future contribution adjustments. Heijmans has no claim to any surplus in the
funds.

Long-service payments						
The long-service payments are a month’s salary, or a portion thereof, for employment periods of 25 and 40 years.

The effects presented apply only to the liabilities and not to the fair value of the investments. For a plan in the form of an
insurance contract, the effect of a change in the discount rate is largely mitigated by an equal but opposite effect on the
plan investments. This is because of the guarantee provided by the insurer.
Heijmans expects to contribute approximately €2 million in 2018 to its defined pension plans and approximately €30
million to defined contribution plans. The expected contributions in subsequent years are likely to be in line with those
expected for 2018, depending on changes in the above-mentioned actuarial assumptions.

Provision for restructuring costs
The provision for restructuring costs relates to the expected severance costs related to organisational changes. Most of the
provision will be used in 2018 and the remainder in the years 2019 and 2020.

Provision for environmental risks
This item represents possible site reinstatement costs. The costs have been estimated by site, based on government
regulations concerning the clean-up method and soil investigation. The periods within which restoration needs to take place
vary by site. In the event that the restoration does not have to take place for another few years, there is an obligation to
monitor the pollution. The expected monitoring costs have also been included in the provision.

Provision for loss-making interests
As at year-end 2017, the provision for loss-making interests amounted to 11,1 million (2016: €10 million). The provision
relates to joint ventures in which the Group’s share is negative.

Other provisions
The other provisions include lawsuits, amounting to €2.2 million (2016: €0.3 million), quarry site reinstatement obligations
of €1.3 million (2016: €1.2 million) and property vacancy amounting to €0.1 million (2016: €0.3 million). Among the
remainder is a provision for potential expenses in connection with occupational disability.

Financial risks and risk management

General
IIn the normal course of business, Heijmans is exposed to various financial risks, including credit, liquidity, market, price and
interest-rate risks.
This section describes the degree to which these risks manifest themselves, the objectives set regarding the risks and the
policy and procedures for measuring and managing them, as well as the management of capital.
The risk policy is focused on the identification and analysis of the risks to which the Group is exposed and the setting of
acceptable limits.
The risk policy and systems are assessed on a regular basis and then modified if necessary for changes in market conditions and the operations of the Group. The objective is to create a disciplined and constructive approach to risk management,
with the aid of training, standards and procedures whereby all employees are aware of their roles and responsibilities.
The Audit Committee periodically reviews the risk management policy and procedures. In addition, the Committee reviews
the risk policy used in the light of the risks to which the Group is exposed.

Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that the Group will be exposed to financial loss if a party against which Heijmans has a claim fails to
meet its contractual obligations. Credit risks arise primarily from receivables due from customers and consortium partners.
The credit risk associated with residential property development is limited, as future residents can only take possession of
the new home once they have met all their obligations and there is pre-financing during the construction stage. The
creditworthiness is assessed in transactions involving the development of commercial property, construction contracts and
infrastructure projects, with additional collateral possibly being requested. Additional forms of security are particularly
important in the case of turnkey projects (paid for on completion), although normally there is pre-financing of transactions
of this kind as well. Where Infrastructure and Non-Residential Building are concerned in particular, Heijmans carries out
many assignments for public authorities, for which the credit risk is considered extremely limited. In these areas of the
business, Heijmans will be part of consortiums working on various large-scale, integrated projects. The more specific the
expertise of a consortium partner, the greater the importance that is attached to the creditworthiness of that partner. In such
cases, a poor credit rating is grounds for not going into partnership, since financial guarantees are not worth anything if
essential know-how is lost.
The assessment of creditworthiness is part of the standard procedure. Credit risk is mitigated by pre-financing arrangements and payments in instalments. Risks are insured with a credit insurer if considered necessary.
The large number of clients, a substantial proportion of which are private individuals and public authorities, means there is
no concentration of credit risk.

The cash and cash equivalents are held at different banks that are assessed as regards creditworthiness. The credit risk is
further mitigated by concentrating the cash as far as possible in cash pools, the cumulative balance of which is predominantly negative over the year.
A provision for doubtful receivables is recognised following an assessment of the potential risks for each individual

Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group cannot meet its financial obligations at the time it is required to do so. See also note
6.20, Interest-bearing loans. The liquidity-risk management assumption is that sufficient liquidity levels will be maintained
to meet current and future financial obligations, in both normal and exceptional circumstances, without incurring unacceptable risks and without endangering the reputation of the Group.					
Weekly 3-month rolling and monthly 12-month rolling liquidity forecasts are among the tools used to determine whether
the Group has sufficient liquidity available. In addition, the availability of credit, including in the form of contingency
funding available from credit insurers or providers of guarantees, is continuously monitored by regularly making projections of the score in relation to financial covenants and engaging in an active dialogue with all financial stakeholders. Based
on this forecast, the Group considers that sufficient liquidity is available to conduct operations.				
To secure the availability of financial resources for both the long term and the short term, Heijmans has access to the
following facilities:
• €45 million in cumulative financing preference shares B without a repayment obligation;
• (year-end 2017) €156 million committed syndicated bank financing, €25 million of which is in the form of a committed
overdraft facility linked to a cash pool. This is being reduced in stages to €122 million by 30 June 2019 (see note 6.20).
The remaining reduction should essentially be achieved by using the spare cash provided by current cash flow trends;
• project financing for which committed financing is available for most of the anticipated principal sum and duration of
the project in question; and
• various operating leases.
In order to satisfy clients’ requirements for bank guarantees, Heijmans has access to guarantee facilities with various
institutions. These facilities are uncommitted. Every two weeks, a projection is made of the use of the available bank
guarantee facilities, based on current tenders and expectations regarding the discharge of existing bank guarantees. Based
on these projections, Heijmans believes that the present extent of the facilities is adequate. 				
At year-end 2017, the bank guarantee facilities totalled € 286 million (2016: € 505 million) provided by a total of 10 parties.
The lower figure was in line with expectations, as a large part of the bank guarantee facilities was held in Belgium and
especially in Germany. As at year-end 2017, there remained €1 million in guarantees relating to the international activities,
with the rest exclusively concerning guarantees for projects associated with operations in the Netherlands.

For the cumulative financing preference shares B, the nominal value has been taken into account on the maturity date and
on the interest rate repricing date. The cumulative financing preference shares B do not have a repayment obligation. In the
liquidity analysis, the nominal value of the loan has been included in the period > 5 years.

Market risk
Market risk is the risk that the income of the Group or the value of financial instruments is adversely affected by changes in
market prices, for example, due to movements in exchange rates, interest rates and share prices. The objective of managing
market risk is to keep the market risk position within acceptable limits while achieving optimum returns.
To manage market risk, derivatives may be bought and sold, and financial commitments may be undertaken. Transactions
of this nature are carried out within established guidelines. .

Price risk
Price risk associated with the purchase of raw materials and consumables as well as with outsourced work, is mitigated by
making price indexation agreements with clients, or where possible by making price agreements with suppliers at an early
stage. If necessary, derivatives may be used occasionally to hedge the price risk of procuring raw materials.

Interest-rate risk
The interest rate policy at Heijmans is directed towards limiting the impact of changes in interest rates on the Group’s
results. For the majority of the project financing arrangements, fixed interest rates are preferred, giving greater certainty
with respect to results on the various projects. Where the syndicated loan is used, financing is at a variable rate. Since this
involves financing of working capital, which is generally not required at the end of the year, there is currently nothing to be
gained from having interest rates fixed for an extended period. The present negative Euribor rate is another factor here. This
policy is subject to constant evaluation.
If the interest rate for 2017 had been 2 percentage points higher on average, the result before tax based on the average level
of debt would have been approximately €1.1 million lower (2016: €2.9 million lower). The effect of a 2 percentage point
difference in interest rates on the Group’s equity (assuming all other variables remained constant) would have been a
decrease of €0.9 million (2016: decrease of €2.2 million).

As at the closing date, 82% (2016: 30%) of the interest-bearing debt had been negotiated at a fixed rate of interest, and 18%
(2016: 70%) at a floating rate. Due to seasonal effects, the average debt during the year is higher than the debt at the closing
date. The portion of the gross debt subject to a floating interest rate is also higher during the year. The gross floating rate
interest debt is offset by items such as cash and cash equivalents, which are also subject to floating rate interest.
The average weighted term to maturity of the project financing is 0.2 years (2016: 0.2 years).		
The interest-bearing loans are measured at amortised cost rather than at fair value. The carrying amount of the loans is
therefore not affected by changes in interest rates.

Currency risk						
The currency risk on sales, purchases and loans is extremely limited for Heijmans, since by far the greater part of the cash
flows within the Group are in euros.

Fair values						
The table below shows the fair values and the carrying amounts of the financial instruments. The fair values are allocated to
different levels of the fair-value hierarchy, depending on the inputs used to determine the measurement methods. The levels
are defined as follows:
level 1: 	quoted (unadjusted) market prices available to the Group on the measurement date, in active markets for identical
assets or liabilities.
level 2: 	input that is not a quoted market price at level 1 but is obtainable for the asset or liability concerned, either directly
(as a price) or indirectly (derived from a price).
level 3: 	input for the asset or liability not based on data available in a market (unobservable input).
Heijmans has no financial assets or liabilities measured at fair value.

* The carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of the fair value.

The above values are based on the present value of future cash flows. The loans with a fixed interest rate are discounted using
the yield curve for 31 December 2017, plus the relevant risk mark-up.
All loans with a variable interest rate are assumed to have a fair value equal to their carrying amount.

Capital management
The policy has been designed to achieve a sound capital position with sufficient availability of credit to be able to ensure
continuity for stakeholders. A sound long-term capital structure is based on operating with sufficient headroom within the
limits of the covenants, in particular the leverage ratio. This means net interest-bearing debt after deduction of cumulative
preference finance shares plus non-recourse finance divided by EBITDA not exceeding 3.0 and an interest cover ratio of at
least 4.0 (see also note 6.20 for a description of the financial ratios in the conditions agreed with the banks).

A charge of €22 million for operating leases was recognised in the statement of profit or loss for 2017 (2016: €24 million).
A charge of €12 million for rental costs was recognised in the statement of profit or loss for 2017 (2016: €14 million).
The lease commitments primarily relate to future instalments on leases for vehicles and equipment. The rental
commitments are for the lease of company buildings. The joint ventures in which Heijmans participates have undertaken
neither rental commitments nor lease commitments.
Approximately 3,300 assets (2,340 cars, 840 vans, and 80 trucks) are leased in the Netherlands on operating lease terms.
In 2017, an umbrella agreement covering the cars and vans was signed with the main leasing company for a term of 4.5
years. The individual contracts covered by the agreement have periods varying from 12 months to 72 months. These
contracts can only be cancelled on payment of the difference between the market value and the carrying amount (if the
market value is lower) and for that portion of the lease payments representing the management fee or administrative
expenses and interest. For trucks, the maximum lease period is usually 120 months.
The above amounts relate to continuing operations.

Contingent liabilities are potential liabilities resulting from events prior to the closing date. The liabilities are potential
because the outflow of economic benefits depends on the occurrence of uncertain events in the future.

(2016: €28 million).
The Group guarantees issued for divested operations (Leadbitter) are not included in the above table. They amount to
€68 million (2016: €78 million). With regard to work completed and work in progress, the guarantees will be taken over by
the buyer if possible. Where this is not possible, the buyer has provided a bank or corporate guarantee.

Other contingent liabilities
The other contingent liabilities of continuing operations with a significant cash impact as at year-end 2017 amount to €17
million (2016: €26 million) and those with a limited cash impact €97 million (2016: €120 million), making a total of €114
million (2016: €146 million). Of the total amount, €18 million 2016: €19 million) is recognised under joint operations. This
relates mainly to commitments to acquire land when the building permit is obtained and/ or a certain sales percentage is
achieved. No Group guarantees were issued in respect of this in 2017 (2016: none).
			
At year-end 2017, the joint ventures in which Heijmans participates had contingent liabilities with significant cash impact
amounting to €3 million (2016: €3 million), and with a limited cash impact amounting to €4 million (2016: €4 million),
making a total of €7 million (2016: €7 million). This relates mainly to commitments to acquire land when the building
permit is obtained and/ or a certain sales percentage is achieved. The aforementioned amounts relate to Heijmans’ share in

Heijmans is affiliated with Stichting Pensioenfonds Heijmans N.V.. The principal function of this company pension fund is to
operate pension plans for Heijmans’ current and former employees and retired staff.
In 2017, some €2.1 million (2016: €1.5 million) in pension contributions was paid by Heijmans to the above-mentioned
company pension fund. Heijmans also made additional contributions of €5 million in 2012 and €3 million in 2013 because
of a prior funding deficit. No additional contributions were made after these. Heijmans is under no obligation to make any
further contributions.

Remuneration of Supervisory Directors
None of the Supervisory Directors hold depositary receipts for shares in Heijmans N.V, nor have they been allocated any
options or depositary receipts for shares. All Supervisory Directors receive a fixed annual fee that is not dependent on the
results in any single year. They also receive a fixed or variable expense allowance. None of the Supervisory Directors has
any other business links to Heijmans from which they could derive personal gain.
The total payments granted to Supervisory Directors in 2017 and 2016 were as follows:

In order to bind directors to the Company for the long term and to encourage a focus on long-term value creation, with
effect from 2010 a Bonus Investment Share Matching Plan has been applicable under which directors can opt to use part of
their variable short-term remuneration to purchase Heijmans shares.
In April 2014, Mr van der Els used 50% of the net short-term bonus awarded to him for 2013 to purchase shares in
Heijmans. Similarly, Mr van den Biggelaar and Mr Hillen each used 20% of their net short-term bonuses for the same
purpose. For each share purchased - in total 2,289 shares - one share is conditionally allocated under the Share Matching
Plan. The allocation becomes vested after three years, following which a mandatory lock-up period of two years comes into
effect. The total expense relating to the allocation of shares is determined at the time of allocation and is recognised on a
time-proportionate basis in the statement of profit or loss over the period until the allocated shares become vested. The
2017 statement of profit or loss includes an amount of €3,210 (2016: €9,629) as a charge relating to the shares awarded in
April 2011. In April 2017, 2,289 shares became vested. The Group issued 2,289 shares in April 2017, granting them to the
existing and former members of the Executive Board concerned. These shares must be held for a minimum of two years.
The pension plan for Mr Hillen is arranged through the industry-wide pension fund and the directly insured average pay
plan. He also receives compensation in respect of termination of the early retirement plan. This compensation is currently
€34,021 (2016: €33,600) and is increased in line with pay increases under the collective labour agreement. In addition, Mr
Hillen received compensation of €97,188 in 2017 (2016: €65,638) for the loss of pension accrual on his salary above
€100,000 and compensation of €50,232 (2016: nil) for the loss of annual increases on the Delta Lloyd average-pay plan. Mr
Majenburg receives a fixed amount in the form of pension contributions. In 2017, this was €72,822 (2016: €85,135) for his
tenure as member of the Executive Board. Mr Janssen receives a fixed amount in the form of pension contributions. In 2017,
this was € 14,667.
The pension charge is calculated in accordance with accounting policy 23.
As at year-end 2017, the members of the Executive Board owned a total of 11,971 depositary receipts for Heijmans shares.
The ownership of these shares is partly a consequence of the Share Matching Plan as described above and partly the result
of the purchase of shares by members of the Executive Board. The ownership of depositary receipts for Heijmans shares by
the individual members of the Executive Board at year-end 2017 is as shown below:

Management estimates and judgements

The accounting information in the financial statements is partly based on estimates and assumptions. The Group makes
these estimates and makes assumptions about future developments, based on factors such as experience and expectations
about future events that may reasonably be expected to occur given the current state of affairs. These estimates and
assumptions are continually reassessed.
Revisions of estimates and assumptions, or differences between estimates and assumptions and actual outcomes, may lead
to material adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities.
Supplementary to the estimates already described in the accounting policies (section 5) and the explanatory notes (6.1 to
6.28), the key elements of estimation uncertainty are explained below.

Measurement of projects				
For more information on the key assumptions used in the measurement of projects, refer to note 6.15, Work in progress. A
higher estimation uncertainty applies for the Wilhelminasluis Zaandam project. With this project, there is a difference of
opinion with the principal mainly concerning the design of the lock chamber. The Construction Industry Arbitration Board
gave its interim decision on this matter in October 2017. The interim decision provides a sufficient basis for completing the
project together. Talks are ongoing with the principal concerning the amount of compensation payable in the light of the
interim decision, a final settlement being the subject of arbitration, and it is expected that this will be decided in 2018. Given
the fact that the compensation has not yet been legally finalised, any estimate of the amount concerned is still subject to
uncertainty. The Group therefore continues to work on the basis of a bandwidth of approximately €10 million up or down,
as disclosed in the previous year’s report.

Financing 					
Note 6.20 discloses the conditions attached to the financing in greater detail. An important condition is the reduction of the
facility (in stages) to €122 million in 2019. Of major importance to the reduction in debt is the effective management of
project risks. This applies equally to the fulfilment of the 2018 business plan and the long-term forecast, especially as
regards achieving the EBITDA and cash flows and satisfying the covenants.

Pensions					
The key actuarial assumptions for the calculation of the pension obligations are outlined in note 6.21.
		

Deferred tax assets					
For more information on the key assumptions used in the measurement of deferred tax assets, refer to note 6.13 Deferred
tax assets and liabilities.

General

The company financial statements are part of the 2017 financial statements of Heijmans N.V.
Please refer to the notes to the consolidated statement of profit or loss and statement of financial position for items in the
company statement of profit or loss and statement of financial position for which no additional explanations are provided.
				

8.2	Accounting policies for measuring assets and liabilities and the determination of results
For determining the accounting policies to use for measuring the assets and liabilities and the determination of results of its
separate financial statements, Heijmans N.V. makes use of the option provided in Section 362, subsection 8 of Book 2 of the
Dutch Civil Code. This means that the basis for measuring assets and liabilities and the determination of results (accounting
policies) applied in the separate financial statements of Heijmans N.V. are the same as those applied in the consolidated
EU-IFRS financial statements. Investees over which significant control is exercised are recognised using the equity method.
Heijmans N.V. is registered with the Chamber of Commerce under number 16004309.
The share in the result of participating interests consists of the share of Heijmans N.V in the result of these participating
interests. Results from transactions where there is a transfer of assets and liabilities between Heijmans N.V. and its investees
or between investees themselves are not recognised insofar as they can be deemed to be unrealised.
For details of the remuneration of the members of the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board, see note 6.28 to the
consolidated financial statements.

Result appropriation

In accordance with Article 31 of the Articles of Association, profit is distributed as follows:
• Subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, the Executive Board transfers as much of the profit to reserves as it
deems necessary;
• Insofar as the profit is not transferred to reserves, it is available to the General Meeting of Shareholders in whole or in
part for transfer to the reserves or in whole or in part for distribution to the holders of ordinary shares in proportion to
the number of ordinary shares owned.
Subject to approval by the Supervisory Board, the Executive Board has decided to add the result after tax, amounting to € 20
million, to the reserves. In view of the importance of the recovery of the balance sheet, the company proposes to refrain from
paying out a dividend on (depositary receipts for) ordinary shares.

Dividend policy
Heijmans N.V. maintains a dividend policy whereby, except in special circumstances, the pay-out ratio amounts to 40% of
the profit from ordinary business operation after tax.

Basis for our opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Dutch law,
including the Dutch Standards on Auditing. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the
“Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial
statements” section of our report.
We are independent of Heijmans N.V. in accordance with
the EU Regulation on specific requirements regarding
statutory audit of public-interest entities, the Wet toezicht
accountantsorganisaties (Wta, Audit firms supervision

for Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to
independence) and other relevant independence
regulations in the Netherlands. Furthermore we have
complied with the Verordening gedrags- en beroepsregels

We believe the audit evidence we have obtained is
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
opinion.

0.5% of the revenues for the financial
year from continued operations

Explanation

Profit before tax is generally
considered as the most appropriate
basis for determining the materiality.
However, the results in recent years
were negative or slightly positive and
not at a level that represents the size
of the company. Therefore we
consider the revenues to provide a
more stable basis for determining the
materiality. The decline of revenues,
and by that the materiality, compared to 2016 is the result of the sale of
the foreign companies in 2017. The
percentage used is at the lower end of
the range.

We have also taken misstatements and/or possible
misstatements into account that in our opinion are
material for the users of the financial statements for
qualitative reasons.
We agreed with the supervisory board that misstatements
in excess of € 350.000, which are identified during the
audit, would be reported to them, as well as smaller
misstatements that in our view must be reported on
qualitative grounds.

were closely involved during the execution of the audit
and reporting by these auditors.
In all, these audit procedures nearly represent the group’s
entire revenues, results and assets.
By performing the procedures mentioned above at
(group) entities, together with additional procedures
carried out at group level, we have been able to obtain
sufficient and appropriate audit evidence about the
group’s financial information to provide an opinion about
the consolidated financial statements.

Our key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of
the financial statements. We have communicated the key
audit matters to the supervisory board. The key audit
matters are not a comprehensive reflection of all matters
discussed.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit
of the financial statements as a whole and in forming our
opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion
on these matters.
The key audit matter Disposal program that we included
last year, is not included because there is no longer a
specific reason for inclusion due to the completion of the
sale of the foreign companies early 2017. No new key
audit matters have been introduced.

Scope of the group audit
Heijmans N.V. is at the head of a group of entities. The
financial information of this group is included in the
consolidated financial statements of Heijmans N.V.
Our group audit mainly focused on the operating
segments, of which Infra is the largest. We performed the
audit procedures at those segments ourselves. We also
used the work of other EY and non-EY auditors when
auditing a number of partnerships. Where we used the
work of other auditors, we have provided instructions and

Significant observations

Recognition of project results and the valuation of work in progress (see notes 6.15 and 6.29)
The valuation of work in progress is
affected by subjective elements such
as estimates of costs and expected
(additional and less) revenue, the
technical progress and (potential)
claims and penalties.
This is partly due to the nature of the
operations, which may be affected by
the complexity of projects, the level of
estimations in the tender process and
developments during the realization of
a project. The process of revenue and
result recognition, including cut-off,
the valuation of receivables and
(potential) claims, as well as all the
completeness of obligations and
provisions related to the projects,
require the Executive Board to make
significant estimates and therefore
have a significant impact on our audit.

220

Annual Report 2017 - Heijmans

We have performed audit procedures
on project management and estimates
related to project results, including the
expected costs and revenue based on
contractual conditions and (potential)
claims and disputes. We also performed substantive audit procedures with
respect to project calculations and the
Executive Board’s estimates thereof.
We discussed the estimates with
various representatives and audited
the evidence of these estimates,
including an assessment of the
outcome of previous estimates. We
also assessed the disclosure notes of
the work in progress and the related
estimates. We paid specific attention to
the Wilhelminasluis project, as the
estimates in the position taken involve
higher levels of estimation
uncertainty.

It is our opinion that the Executive
Board has chosen appropriate
accounting policies for the recognition
of project results and that these have
been applied consistently.
We have determined that the estimates and assumptions used by the
Executive Board are within a reasonable range and that the disclosure
provided is adequate.

Significant observations

Funding and covenants (see notes 6.20 and 6.29)
The availability of sufficient funding to
meet the company’s liquidity
requirements, the safeguarding of
sufficient guarantee facilities, as well
as compliance with financing
covenants are significant to our audit.
Our audit of this is primarily based on
the Executive Board’s expectations and
estimates in this respect.
The assumptions applied are affected
by subjective elements, such as the
estimate of expected future cash flows
based on forecasts for revenue,
margins and other results from the
company’s operational activities.
The estimates are based on assumptions, including expectations of future
economic and market developments.

We paid specific attention to the
assumptions applied and the forecasts
prepared by the Executive Board in its
Business Plan 2018. This includes
assumptions applied with respect to
future revenue and result, including
the backlog, as well as the potential
impact of the realization of a number
of significant projects, to assess
whether the company will be able to
continue to meet its liquidity requirements and the conditions of the
covenants in the year ahead. We also
assessed the disclosure notes prepared
by the Executive Board, as included in
the financial statements.

In our opinion the Executive Board’s
estimates with respect to the availability of sufficient funding are adequate
and expectations and estimates are
within a reasonable range.
We also determined that the disclosure
notes related to available funding and
the prevailing covenants are adequate.

Valuation of intangible fixed assets (see note 6.10)
The intangible fixed assets mainly
comprise goodwill. The Executive
Board conducts an annual impairment
test on these assets. This test is mainly
based on the Executive Board’s
expectations and estimates with
respect to future results and cash
flows. The goodwill related to the
business units Non-Residential and
Infra is the most significant due to its
size. The testing is significant to our
audit given the complexity of the
estimation process, including the
potential developments on a number
of significant projects. The recoverable
value is based on the net present value
of future cash flows.

We paid specific attention to the
expected results and cash flows, as
included in the Business Plan 2018
prepared by the Executive Board. We
also assessed the realization of the
Business Plan prepared in the previous
year, as this gives an indication of the
quality of the estimates made.
Supported by our own valuation
experts, we focused our work primarily
on the parameters that have the
greatest impact on the determination
of the recoverable value of goodwill,
such as the discount rate, revenue
volume and EBIT margin.
We also assessed whether the
disclosure notes contain sufficient
information and provide sufficient
insight into the chosen assumptions
and the sensitivity of the
valuation.

In our opinion the Executive Board’s
estimates with respect to potential
impairments are adequate and the
parameters and expectations used are
within a reasonable range.
We would like to point out that on the
basis of the impairment test carried
out, the company concluded that there
is limited headroom at the NonResidential business unit. We also
determined that the disclosures
provided is adequate.

Significant observations

Valuation of strategic land positions and land in-use (see note 6.14)
The valuation of strategic land
positions and land in-use is strongly
affected by market developments in
the Dutch housing market and other
subjective elements. The land
positions are generally only taken into
development after a long period of
time, partly under influence of
changes in the area of land-use
planning within provinces and
municipalities.
The company runs an impairment test
on these assets semi-annually. This
test is significant for our audit, given
the nature of the activities, the
complexity of the estimation process,
the assumptions applied in these
estimates and the level of subjectivity
involved. The estimation process
requires the Executive Board to make
significant estimates. The net recoverable value is based on the expected
future cash flows, which depend
among other things on the estimated
likelihood of realization, the expected
timing of the realization and the
estimated sales prices and construction costs.
This valuation is evidenced using
qualitative descriptions and key
figures. The calculation models for the
land holdings are also updated each
year.

222

Annual Report 2017 - Heijmans

We performed audit procedures with
respect to the estimates related to the
valuation of strategic land positions
and land in-use. This involved, among
other things, assessing whether the
correct source data was used and
whether the calculation models
applied were used correctly.
In our audit we made use of our own
valuation specialists. We discussed the
estimates with various representatives
and assessed the substantiation of
these estimates, including an
assessment of the outcome of previous
estimation processes. We also paid
specific attention to the assumptions
that have the greatest impact on the
determination of the net recoverable
value, such as the design and
execution of development plans and
the expected development of land and
house prices.
We also assessed whether the
disclosure notes given provide
sufficient information and provide
sufficient insight into the assumptions
chosen for the valuation.

It is our opinion that the Executive
Board’s estimates with respect to
potential impairments are adequate
and that the parameters and expectations they used are within a reasonable
range.
We also determined that the disclosure
notes are adequate.

Significant observations

Valuation of deferred tax assets (see note 6.13)
A deferred tax asset is recognized for
deductible tax losses in so far as it is
probable that there will be sufficient
future taxable profit to offset these
losses. The assessment thereof is
significant for our audit, because the
estimation process is complex and is
affected by Executive Board estimates.
These estimates include expected
operational and fiscal results that are
partly based on assumed future
economic and market developments.

We performed audit procedures with
respect to, among other things, the
assumptions in the forecast that have
the greatest impact on the fiscal result,
such as EBIT and non-deductible or
deferred items. The Business Plan
2018 is also partly based on these
forecasts. In the execution of our
procedures, we made use of our own
tax experts. We also assessed whether
the disclosure notes provide sufficient
information and provide sufficient
insight into the assumptions made for
the valuation.

Description of responsibilities for the financial
statements
Responsibilities of the Executive Board and the
supervisory board for the financial statements
The Executive Board is responsible for the preparation and
fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance
with EU-IFRS and Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.
Furthermore, the Executive Board is responsible for such
internal control as Executive Board deems necessary to
enable the preparation of the financial statements that
are free from material misstatement, whether due to
fraud or error.
As part of the preparation of the financial statements, the
Executive Board is responsible for assessing the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Based on
the financial reporting frameworks mentioned, the
Executive Board should prepare the financial statements
using the going-concern basis of accounting unless the
Executive Board either intends to liquidate the company
or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but
to do so. The Executive Board should disclose events and
circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the
company’s ability to continue as a going concern in the
financial statements.
The supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the
company’s financial reporting process.

Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial
statements
Our responsibility is to plan and perform the audit
engagement in a manner that allows us to obtain
sufficient and appropriate audit evidence for our opinion.
Our audit has been performed with a high, but not
absolute, level of assurance, which means we may not
have detected all material errors and fraud.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate,

they could reasonably be expected to influence the
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these
financial statements. The materiality affects the nature,
timing and extent of our audit procedures and the
evaluation of the effect of identified misstatements on our
opinion.
We have exercised professional judgment and have
maintained professional skepticism throughout the audit,
in accordance with Dutch Standards on Auditing, ethical
requirements and independence requirements. Our audit
included among others things:
• identifying and assessing the risks of material
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due
to fraud or error, designing and performing audit
procedures responsive to those risks, and obtaining
audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to
provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not
detecting a material misstatement resulting from
fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as
fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of
internal control;
• obtaining an understanding of internal control
relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not
for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the company’s internal control;
• evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies
used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates
and related disclosures made by the Executive Board;
• concluding on the appropriateness of Executive
Board’s use of the going concern basis of accounting,
and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a
material uncertainty exists related to events or
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the
company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If
we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are
required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the
related disclosures in the financial statements or, if
such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our
opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit

we do not perform any activities that could result in a
conflict of interest with our independent assurance
engagement. Furthermore, we have complied with the
Verordening gedrags- en beroepsregels accountants

We believe that the assurance evidence we have obtained
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
conclusion.

Limitations to the scope of our review
engagement
Unexamined prospective information
The sustainability information includes prospective
information such as ambitions, strategy, plans, expectations and estimates and risk assessments. Inherently, the
actual future results are uncertain. We do not provide any
assurance on the assumptions and achievability of
prospective information in the sustainability information.
Unreviewed references to external sources
The references to external sources or websites in the
sustainability information are not part of the
sustainability information as reviewed by us. We
therefore do not provide assurance on this information.

Responsibilities of the Executive Board and
the Supervisory board for the sustainability
information
The Executive Board is responsible for the preparation of
the sustainability information in accordance with the
Sustainability Reporting Standards (option Core of GRI
and the applied supplemental reporting criteria as
disclosed in the appendices ‘Reporting Methodology’ and
‘KPI Table’ of the annual report, including the identification of stakeholders and the definition of material
matters. The choices made by the Executive Board
regarding the scope of the sustainability information and
the reporting policy are summarized in the appendices
‘Reporting Methodology’ and ‘KPI Table’ of the annual
report.
The Executive Board is also responsible for such internal
control as the Executive Board determines is necessary to
enable the preparation of the sustainability information
that is free from material misstatement, whether due to
fraud or errors.
The Supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the
reporting process of Heijmans N.V.

Our responsibilities for the review of the
sustainability information
Our responsibility is to plan and perform the assurance
engagement with a limited level of assurance in a
manner that allows us to obtain sufficient and appropriate assurance evidence for our conclusion.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

APPENDICES

Procedures performed to obtain a limited level of
assurance are aimed to determine the plausibility of
information and vary in nature and timing from, and are
less in extent, than for a reasonable assurance engagement. The level of assurance obtained in review engagements is therefore substantially less than the assurance
obtained in audit engagements.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate,
they could reasonably be expected to influence the
decisions of users taken on the basis of the sustainability
information. The materiality affects the nature, timing
and extent of our review procedures and the evaluation of
the effect of identified misstatements on our conclusion.
We apply the ‘Nadere voorschriften kwaliteitssystemen’
(Regulations for Quality management systems) and
accordingly maintain a comprehensive system of quality
control including documented policies and procedures
regarding compliance with ethical requirements,
professional standards and other applicable legal and
regulatory requirements.
We have exercised professional judgement and have
maintained professional skepticism throughout the
review engagement performed by a multi-disciplinary
team, in accordance with the Dutch Standard 3810N,
ethical requirements and independence requirements.

Heijmans Share
Administration Trust

The following report is presented in line with the best
practice provisions 4.4.6 and 4.4.7 of the Corporate
Governance Code.

Methods
To emphasise the independence of the Heijmans Share
Administration Trust (hereinafter referred to as ‘the SA
Trust’), its Board of Trustees first meets in the absence of
the members of the Company’s Executive Board. The
members of the Executive Board and the Chair of the
Supervisory Board then join the meeting.

Number of shares for which depositary
receipts have been issued
The SA Trust has issued depositary receipts for ordinary
shares of Heijmans N.V. with the company’s cooperation.
The SA Trust is an independent legal entity, as defined in
Section 5:71 (1)(d) of the Financial Supervision Act.
As at 31 December 2017, the SA Trust had ordinary shares
with a nominal value of €6,422,748.60 in administration,
for which 21,409,162 bearer depositary receipts with a
nominal value of €0.30 had been issued.

Number of meetings of the Board of Trustees
and most important agenda items
The Board of Trustees of the SA Trust met on three
occasions during the year under review.

Meeting of 22 March 2017
The following subjects were discussed during this regular
meeting of the Board:
• The 2016 annual report of Heijmans N.V. and the press
release of 24 February 2017;
• Discussion of the items on the agenda for the General
Meeting of Shareholders of Heijmans N.V. to be held
on 12 April 2017;
• The annual report of the SA Trust for 2016;
• The evaluation of the Meeting of Depositary Receipt
Holders of 18 November 2016;
• The appointment of a new trustee.

During the meeting, the SA Trust Board made a number
of comments and asked questions of the chairman of the
Executive Board with respect to subjects including:
• The financial bandwidth of the risk projects specifically
mentioned in the annual report;
• The extent to which certain types of contract play a
role in the risk profile of projects;
• The vision of the Executive Board on the Dutch market,
the relationship between client and contracted party
and in particular the distribution of risks;
• The consequences of (persistently) narrow margins in
certain sectors of the construction industry for the
strategic focus of the company.
In the spring of 2017, one trustee stepped down. The
trustee in question was Mr W.M. van den Goorbergh. The
Meeting of Depositary Receipt Holders did not submit a
recommendation for the filling of this vacancy. The Board
of Trustees made use of its discretionary power laid down
in the Articles of Association to deviate from the maximum number of reappointments and appointed Mr. Van
den Goorbergh for an additional four-year period. The
Board took into consideration the importance of continuity within the Board, partly in view of the term in office
of the other board members, and in view of the phase in
which Heijmans currently finds itself. The Board also
considered that the Chair could step down in the interim
if this should prove necessary due to governance
considerations.

Meeting of 13 September 2017
Subjects discussed in this regular meeting included:
• The 2017 half-year results of Heijmans N.V.;
• The resolution to hold a Meeting of Depositary Receipt
Holders on 17 November 2017;
• The composition of the Board: Mr. J.J.G.M. Sanders will
step down as of the spring meeting of 2018.
During the meeting, the SA Trust Board made a number
of comments and asked questions of the chairman of the
Executive Board and the Supervisory Board on subjects
including:

• The results of the sale of the foreign subsidiaries;
• The situation in the sector;
• The results of the various business areas and their

Meeting of 17 November 2017
The extra board meeting focused on the preparations for
the Meeting of Depositary Receipt Holders of 17
November 2017.

Participation SA Trust Board in the General
Meeting of Shareholders of 12 April 2017
The Board of Trustees of the SA Trust was represented at
the General Meeting of Shareholders on 12 April 2017 and
voted in favour of all the resolutions that were put to a
vote.
At the General Meeting of Shareholders, the SA Trust
Board asked questions on subjects including the
management of certain risk projects, in view of the
bandwidth of around € 45 million provided in 2017 with
respect to those projects in light of the ambition to realise
EBITDA of at least € 20 million in 2017. The Board also
asked how much capital Heijmans has available to
absorb additional setbacks and to what extent the
Executive Board itself took the decision to continue the
less-profitable Dutch activities while selling the more
profitable foreign operations. During the meeting, Mr. Van
den Goorbergh also responded to a comment from a
representative of the shareholders association VEB to the
effect that a share administration trust always votes
blindly in favour of resolutions. Mr. Van den Goorbergh
pointed out that the Board of the Trust is guided by how
the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board account
for the supervision and management during the General

Meeting of Shareholders. The SA Trust decides on that
basis which way it votes.
The SA Trust granted authorisation to holders of
depositary receipts who attended the General Meeting of
Shareholders in person or who were represented by a
third party, to vote independently on the number of
depositary receipts reported for shares prior to the
meeting, with due observance of the Articles of
Association and Trust Conditions.
As was the case in 2010 through 2016, in its convening
notice for the General Meeting of Shareholders, the board
of the SA Trust offered holders of depositary receipts who
were unable to attend the shareholders meeting in person
the opportunity to express their view on certain issues via
e-mail or otherwise in writing. The SA Trust is thus able to
take these views into consideration when determining
how it will cast its vote. Once again, there was no
response.

Votes cast at the General Meeting of
Shareholders on 12 April 2017
Of the 21,406,873 (depositary receipts for) shares SA Trust
had issued by 12 April 2017, 4,303,193 (depositary
receipts) for shares were registered as present at the
meeting (approximately 20.1%; 2016: approximately
22.7%). Of the total of 4,303,193, the holders of 1,466,181
(depositary receipts for) shares attended the Meeting, and
the holders of another 2,830,455 had issued voting
instructions to ABN AMRO. SA Trust therefore represented
17,110,237 (depositary receipts for) shares at the AGM, or
approximately 80%.

Participation of the Board of Trustees of the
SA Trust at the General Meeting of
Shareholders of 17 October 2017
During this meeting, the Supervisory Board explained
their intention to appoint Mr. J.G. Janssen as member of
the Executive Board / CFO. This was the sole item on the
agenda and not a voting issue. Mr. Van den Goorbergh
represented the Trust Board at this meeting.

Meeting of Depositary Receipt Holders on 17
November 2017
During the Meeting of Depositary Receipt Holders on 17
November 2017, the Board of Trustees of the SA Trust
gave an explanation of its policy, partly based on
principle 4.4.6 and the corresponding best-practice
provisions of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code.
The holders of (depositary receipts) for shares represented
5,990 shares/depositary receipts. As at 17 November
2017, the SA Trust had issued a total of 21,409,162 shares
or depositary receipts for shares. This means that,
rounded off, approximately 0% of the shares and
depositary receipts for shares issued by the SA Trust were
represented at this meeting (in 2016, approximately
0.04%).

Activities
The activities related to the administration of the shares
or depositary receipts for shares are carried out by the
administrator for the SA Trust, SGG Netherlands N.V. of
Amsterdam.

Costs
The costs associated with the activities of the SA Trust are
primarily related to the costs of administration (which are
charged by SGG) and the fees charged by the auditor EY
for the audit of the financial statements. There are also
expenses relating to the remuneration of the trustees (see
the section Board of Trustees and Remuneration).

The Heijmans Preference
Share Trust

The Heijmans Preference Share Trust (hereinafter ‘the
Trust’) is an independent legal entity as defined in Section
5:71 (1)(c) of the Financial Supervision Act.
As stated in its articles of association of 3 August 2013,
the purpose of the Trust is:
• To promote the interests of Heijmans N.V. (the
company) and of the business that is maintained by
the company and the companies affiliated with the
company in a Group, in such a way that the interests
of the company and of that business and of all those
involved are optimally safeguarded, and that
influences that could compromise the independence
and/or continuity and/or the identity of the company
and of those businesses contrary to those interests, are
defended against to the greatest extent possible, as
well as to take any action connected with or possibly
conducive to the above;
• The Trust endeavours to attain its goal by, among
other things, acquiring and managing shares, in
particular preference shares, in the capital of the
Company and by exercising - in court proceedings or
elsewhere - the rights granted to it pursuant to the law,
articles of association or by virtue of agreement; and
• The Trust may dispose of the shares it has acquired or
may pledge them, provided that the voting rights
associated with the relevant shares do not transfer to
the pledgee, or may otherwise encumber these shares,
on the understanding that the Company’s approval is
necessary for any disposal of shares.

The Trust has the right (a call option) to acquire preference shares in the capital of Heijmans N.V. up to a
maximum of almost 100% of the nominal value of the
capital issued in ordinary shares and financing preference
shares B.
The put option contract that Heijmans Preference
Share Trust entered into with Heijmans N.V., whereby the
Trust could purchase preference shares as soon as
Heijmans N.V. issued them, was terminated in 2016.
The Trust was granted the right of inquiry in 2008.

Tax policy

Introduction
In this section, Heijmans explains its policy with respect
to taxes. This explanation covers: the relationship with the
tax authorities, the taxes Heijmans pays and the company’s views of the current national and international
discussion with respect to the tax policy of multinationals.

Relationship with the tax authorities
Heijmans believes that transparency is part of corporate
social responsibility. This means Heijmans always
operates with full transparency vis-à-vis the tax authorities and always shares all facts fully and completely. This
also applies to the intended fiscal outcome of any
potential points of discussion.
In the context of horizontal supervision, Heijmans has
agreed a covenant with the Dutch Tax Inspectorate
(Belastingdienst). Horizontal supervision equates to equal
cooperation between the tax inspectorate and Heijmans
on the basis of reciprocal trust and highly transparent
communications. These premises are laid down in a
covenant. The tax inspectorate enters into these covenants
only if the company has an effective Tax Control
Framework or seeks to realise same together with the tax
inspectorate in the short term. This means the company
has a solid grip on its fiscal position and fiscal risks and
that the company’s management also attaches great
importance to same. As a result of the horizontal
supervision, Heijmans has several consultations with the
Tax inspectorate throughout the year.

Fiscal planning
National tax laws, international treaties and known
jurisprudence outline which income is taxed and which
costs are deductible. Individual taxable entities have no
choice in this. In its business operations, Heijmans applies
these rules fairly. The fair application of laws, regulations
and jurisprudence is explicitly not aimed at artificially
reducing the effective tax rate. A term such as ‘fair
application of the law’ is obviously always open to
discussion. Because what one considers fair does not go
far enough for another. Heijmans will take into

234

Annual Report 2017 - Heijmans

consideration the views of the Tax Inspectorate when
making definitive fiscal choices that involve potential
discussion points.
Heijmans is frequently involved in alliances and complex
projects that may result in complex financial transactions.
These projects and/or transactions may be difficult to
comprehend and the fiscal consequences can be
substantial for the parties involved, depending on the
interpretation of certain facts. In these projects or
transactions, Heijmans’ policy is to always act in line with
the purpose or spirit of the prevailing fiscal legislation.
This means therefore that certain, legally intended fiscal
benefits are realised in such projects and/or transactions.
However, Heijmans will not cooperate in transactions with
the purpose of realising tax savings that are contrary to
fiscal regulations.

Policy with respect to developing countries
Heijmans has no operational activities in developing
countries. Heijmans therefore has no fiscal structures via
developing countries that result in reduced tax payments.
This also applies to fiscal structures in countries where
(virtually) no taxes are levied (so-called tax havens).
Heijmans has no companies in the Netherlands or abroad
with the purpose of artificially reducing the tax rate within
the group.

Policy with respect to clients and/or
subcontractors
Heijmans believes that its clients and/or subcontractors
bear responsibility for their own fiscal decisions. The
company does, however, expect its clients and/or
subcontractors to operate with integrity. Heijmans will
never knowingly cooperate in setting up fiscal structures
that contravene the purpose and spirit of the law in order
to realise a reduction in taxes.

Tax policy of multinationals
There is growing public attention for both the national
and international tax policy of multinationals.
Multinationals use so-called fiscal planning to seek out

PROFILE & STRATEGY

REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD

CORPORATE GOVERANCE

the limits of laws and regulations. They use a variety of
structures to route their profits to countries with friendly
tax rates and all in a legal manner. However, despite the
legality of these constructions, they have prompted a
broad social debate in the media about the tax planning
of multinationals. This has resulted in various legislative
initiatives on both a national and international level.
Heijmans acknowledges the importance of open and
constructive discussion of tax ethics. Current laws and
regulations and generally applicable and accepted
principles of international tax law should be the basic
premise in this. Heijmans believes that transparent
communications, consideration of the intent of the
legislator and a consistent application of the current tax
policy should form the basis of this public discussion.

Tax rate (income tax)
The tax rate as shown in Heijmans’ financial statements
only refers to income tax, including Dutch corporate
income tax. The nominal tax rate in the Netherlands is
25%. The other countries where Heijmans is liable for
income tax are Belgium and Germany. The nominal rates
in these countries are higher than in the Netherlands. In
the first half of 2017, Heijmans sold the operational
activities in Belgium and Germany. Fiscal profits result in
the payment of income tax. Tax losses also have value
provided certain conditions are met. These losses can be
offset against fiscal profits from other years. In some
instances, tax losses therefore may result in an asset. This
asset is, in principle, recognised in Heijmans’ statement of
financial position. Heijmans has such losses from earlier
years, which can be offset against future profits.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

APPENDICES

These rules are often prescribed and it is therefore not
possible for a taxable entity to make choices in this. For
instance, certain types of income are tax exempt under
local fiscal legislation. And there are also operating
expenses that are not tax-deductible. Heijmans aims for
full transparency and therefore explains its tax position
extensively in its financial statements. The profit shown in
Heijmans’ annual financial statements relates to all
activities of the company (including the foreign activities).
Heijmans files income tax statements in all the countries
where it has operations. The fiscal policy premises are the
same in these countries. This means there is no direct
relationship between the corporate income tax Heijmans
pays in the Netherlands and the group result as presented in the annual financial statements.

Other taxes
The effective tax rate included in the annual financial
statements refers only to income taxes. In addition to
income tax, Heijmans also pays other taxes, such as
payroll tax, property transfer tax, value added tax
(turnover tax), insurance tax and various municipal taxes.
Heijmans has virtually no activities that are exempt from
value added tax. This means that virtually all input tax
can be settled against the value added tax Heijmans is
due to pay. The amount of value added tax that cannot be
offset is therefore very small.

Explanation corporate income tax
Heijmans’ financial statements are drawn up in line with
IFRS. However, there are numerous differences between
the accounting principles of IFRS and local tax regulations
that apply to the calculation of the fiscal result. The
differences between the various principles clearly have a
significant impact on the income taxes Heijmans is liable
to pay.

Reporting methodology

Scope

236

In view of the divestment strategy, Heijmans is reporting
key figures only for its Dutch activities in 2017. Combined
projects have not been included in the non-financial
information of the annual report, with the exception of
safety-related information.

Lastly, reporting also includes data originating from the
certified management systems ISO 14001, ISO 9001 and
VCA. Although we have implemented several procedures
for the reporting of incidents and we have actually
received reports of incidents, Heijmans cannot be entirely
certain that every incident has been reported.

Information gathering and verification

Reporting methodology

Those involved in preparing the content and design of
this report held regular consultations during the year.
They organised a kick-off session in October at which they
shared experiences from the previous year, together with
targets and ambitions. Those involved reached agreements regarding content, ambition and planning. This
formed the basis for the underlying report. The data used
originate from the various administrations, systems and
databases in the Heijmans organisation, including a
number of management systems and the registration
data on operating processes those systems produce.
Examples include Prinsys for HRM-related aspects, energy
management systems, as well as the likes of SMILE
software for quality-related information and accident
statistics. Information is also derived from other sources,
such as the ERP systems and information from suppliers,
including those supplying the company’s vehicle fleet,
companies providing timber and waste processing and
energy companies. The environmental reporting of the
asphalt plants is verified externally and the data are
submitted to the competent authority.

Sustainability-related disclosures are presented in line
with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI Standards, Core
option). Where possible, Heijmans uses the same
terminology used in ISO 26000 and the Integrated
Reporting Framework of the International Integrated
Reporting Council. The report covers the reporting period
01-01-2017 through 31-12-2017.
The Global Reporting Initiative GRI standards were used
as a basis for the report. Heijmans also used the supplement for the Construction sector. With respect to the
reporting on CO2 emissions, we used the Greenhouse Gas
Protocol. Information came from the consolidated data in
the company’s business systems. Heijmans assigned
Ernst & Young Accountants LLP to provide limited
assurance. The assurance report they issued has been
included in this report.

Specific remarks per KPI:
• Financial health. This includes financial base
indicators according to the definitions in the IFRS
accounting manual.
• Strategy and implementation. These indicators are
included due to their high scores in the materiality
matrix and because they provide insight into the
number of improvement processes currently ongoing
in the organisation, expenditure on innovation and the
number of new patents applied for.
• Satisfied customers and end users. Client satisfaction
is measured in a number of ways at Heijmans, which
means there is no overall figure available.
Components that contribute to client satisfaction are
project evaluations, customer satisfaction measurements at residential building, number of snagging
items.
• Health and Safety: this includes data about absenteeism, accidents and prevention agreements with
subcontractors.
• Procurement and chain integration. This indicator is
also an expression of the strategy aimed at operating
in a more integrated manner with a smaller number
of suppliers.
• ‘Greenification’ of internal business operations and
chain. Aspects such as energy consumption at offices
and the proportion of energy-efficient lease cars are
measured as part of the total Heijmans CO2 footprint.
Data on waste are reported according to the ENCORD
methodology.

Safety
The calculation method for these KPIs changed as of
2017, which means figures for 2016 and 2017 are not
suitable for comparison.
• The IF figure for 2017 includes combined projects
calculated pro rata.
• The IF figure for 2016 is exclusive of combined projects
• The number of accidents stated for 2017 includes
combined projects, calculated pro rata
• The calculation of the number of accidents in 2016
includes 100% of combined projects, as far as accidents
relating to those combined projects are concerned.

Transparency benchmark
This is an annual survey of the content and quality of
CSR reporting at Dutch companies. In 2017, Heijmans
ranked 17th in the total of more than 250 companies
included in the survey, based on the survey of reporting
on the 2016 financial year.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Disclosure and methodology for CO2
calculation
Heijmans measures and reports its CO2 emissions using
the scopes classification of the Green House Gas (GHG)
protocol.
• Scope 1 covers the emissions from the fuels we
purchase and use ourselves (mainly gas, petrol and
diesel)
• Scope 2 includes CO2 emissions from electricity usage
(this CO2 is emitted by the energy company, not by
Heijmans itself) and business traffic.
• Scope 3 (not included in this annual report) includes
CO2 emitted by commuter travel and public transport.
The primary focus is on scope 1, with a secondary focus
on scope 2. These are the scopes that are the most directly
influenced by taking measures. The majority of Heijmans’
emissions occur in these scopes.

Footprint in the Netherlands
CO2 emissions in the Netherlands amounted to 51,088
tonnes in 2017, a decrease of 2.8% compared to 2016
(52,563 tonnes).

Target for 2016-2020 in the Netherlands
Heijmans has set a target for the reduction of its CO2
emissions in relation to revenue by at least 10% over four
years, and uses 2016 as the reference year for both
emissions and revenue. The new EMP (Energy
Management Plan) 2017-2020 includes supplementary
measures aimed at a further reduction in CO2 emissions
during this period. The main focus will be on reducing
emissions from asphalt plants, projects and leased cars.
We have included specific measures in the plan, which
Heijmans will use to reduce energy consumption and
thus CO2 emissions in the coming years. In 2017, the
entire Heijmans organisation was assessed against the
criteria of the CO2 performance ladder, with the purpose of
gaining a CO2-aware certificate for the entire group. This
certificate will be issued in the course of 2018.
Heijmans uses the conversion factors from the www.
co2emissiefactoren.nl website. The reporting methodology Heijmans uses means these are updated every four
years. This update was implemented in 2017. This annual
report is based on the updated conversation factors for
the CO2 figures from 2017. We have not adjusted the
comparable figures for 2016 due to non-material
differences.

Key Performance Indicator

Explanation specific KPIs
1: The indicator complaints received at NV level has been replaced with a more effective indicator directly related to larger clients
2: Total amount of waste material is a material aspect and is therefore reported in the annual report. It has not been possible to link this with
concrete reduction targets for the past few years due to the strong dependence on the nature of contracts offered (including or excluding
demolition). Through activities in LEAN design and circular building, Heijmans is already working towards high-grade processing of waste flows
and on minimising waste in the design phase.

Summary of
stakeholder meetings

In 2017, Heijmans held a number of stakeholder
meetings with a mix of representatives from stakeholder
groups relevant to Heijmans. In these meetings, Heijmans
discussed and assessed current and strategic themes
relevant to the materiality analysis. We used a qualitative
analysis method, which resulted in the following
recommendations:

Residential Building
The meeting addressed a number of key aspects of the
materiality analysis: sustainable mobility, energy
transition and material innovations. Those present also
discussed demands from customers and users and how to
turn these into solutions. The participants recognised the
themes in relation the market and Heijmans and
confirmed the prioritisation of the aspects in the materiality analysis. More specifically, the energy and material
aspects stood out as key themes. With respect to these
aspects, it was indicated the developer is expected to have
a high level of knowledge on this front and expectations
included continuous improvement of energy efficiency.
There is demand for a comprehensive vision that
combines sustainability aspects and energy efficiency.
Another topic discussed at the meeting was the trend
towards digitalisation, both in terms of sensors and smart
technology and in terms of production methods that can
be optimised using robotics. This would enable the
company to structure processes differently, which would
also improve the working method and transparency
towards customers. This would also lead to different
business models, which would in turn simplify developments such as energy sharing. Those present at the
meeting see a clear relation between digitalisation and a
sustainable, more circular economy.

Non-residential/company-wide
This meeting was held in the spring of 2017, and was
attended by Heijmans’ CEO, which prompted discussion
of a number of company-wide themes.
In the meeting, participants discussed a number of
themes from the materiality analysis, including safety
and health in the workplace, a distinctive profile,

242

Annual Report 2017 - Heijmans

partnerships for innovation and co-creation, satisfied
customers and knowledge intensity. Another topic of
discussion was the trend towards digitalisation and smart
buildings. These are buildings equipped with various
integrated technologies that function more efficiently on
the basis of connectivity and data collection, and increase
comfort levels for users. Digitalisation is becoming an
increasingly important theme in the materiality analysis,
which was recognised and confirmed by those present.
They indicated that this goes beyond technological
developments and the aspects related to same, and
includes aspects such as the people needed for it, learning
potential, collaboration and contract forming in this new
kind of business, as well as the handling of data in
relation to ownership and privacy.
The conclusion was that Heijmans’ Non-Residential
business area can play an important role in the development and management of Smart Buildings. In addition to
the hard side, this also demands clear vision on people
and human capital in the broadest sense of the term.
According to those present, this should be more prominent in the continued development of the ‘contours of
tomorrow’ vision. Knowledge development and technology together should improve how people feel in their
working environments.

Infra
In the Infra stakeholder meetings, the emphasis was on
the theme of ‘circularity’. This theme has major impact in
the infra business, where Heijmans works with manufacturers and which is seeing increasingly high demands
being set for materials and material uses. Heijmans
assessed whether the group of stakeholders also see the
importance of this aspect, how this perception is manifested, how they themselves are dealing with it and what
they expect from a builder. Most (public/governmentrelated) client groups recognise the theme and have set
goals on this front. This pertains to the procurement of
circular materials or striving to be energy neutral. A
circular approach and developing circular solutions make
an important contribution to this objective. In tenders and
projects, principals and clients are already asking for

concrete solutions.
The group informed Heijmans that they are not seen as a
frontrunner, but that an initiative and collaboration such
as Madaster does show that Heijmans is taking the
subject seriously and developing solutions. The conclusion of the meeting was that the circular proposition as a
material aspect should be given a higher priority in the
matrix, seeing as there is real demand for this in the
market.

and continuity

Scope is the Dutch market,
in which Heijmans is often
dependent on public
tenders to win contracts.
Many activities are also
framed by legislation and
regulations.

In the annual report,
Heijmans reports
extensively on the financial
values and management
processes within Heijmans
for economic performance.

Satisfied customers and
users (Chapter: Strategy)

The client stakeholder
group is of course crucial to
Heijmans. In meetings,
clients indicate that
delivering added value for a
good price creates
satisfaction.

Most of Heijmans’ clients
are Dutch, and their users
are almost entirely in the
Netherlands. Heijmans
mostly acquires projects
through tenders for which
the design and client
specifications have already
been established.

Heijmans measures
customer satisfaction in
different ways, but there is
no uniform total figure

ensure customer
satisfaction is measured are
project evaluations,
customer satisfaction
measurements in
residential building and
delivery points.

As part of the ISO 9001
quality management
system, Heijmans has
implemented mechanisms
for evaluation.
Measurements are often
very different per section.
Infra and Residential
Building are reported on
the basis of the KPIs in this
report.

Health and safety in the
workplace (Chapter: People
and organisation)

A safe workplace is one of
Heijmans’ key priorities.
From the perspective of the
stakeholder group,
employees are of primary
importance. Many
construction activities are
also dangerous due to large
masses and numerous
vehicles.

Heijmans operates almost
exclusively in the
Netherlands, which means
that Dutch labour
legislation governs the
creation of a safe and
healthy working
environment.

Within Heijmans,
employees are trained
according to SCC methods.
Subcontractors are also
expected to have SCC or
comparable certification.
Heijmans also takes
physical precautions on
building sites to promote
safety. Finally, Heijmans
has a semi-internal health
and safety service (ASC).

Evaluation is part of the
SCC system. Different
indicators are also
measured by the specific
organisation of Quality &
Safety. KPIs include the
number of accidents,
subcontractors’ SCC
certification and the IF.

Strategy implementation
(Chapter: Strategy)

The shareholder
stakeholder group in
particular believes that the
communication and
implementation of a
strategy is important.

The strategy is aimed at
the Dutch market. The
speed at which the strategy
is implemented is partly
dependent on the financial
health of the organisation.

Heijmans has reported
(qualitatively) in various
parts of the annual report
on the progression of the
strategy. It is aimed at
improving and renewing
the core activities and
processes. It is expressed
through reports from the
LEAN system.

The strategy is evaluated in
the quarterly reports of the
various business units.
Progress is also tested
within the executive board
and reports to the
supervisory board.

Procurement and chain
integration (Chapter:
Strategy)

Procurement is an
important aspect of
business operations,
because a large part of the
revenue is procured in the
form of materials and
labour.

Procurement is handled
per cluster. Suppliers are
evaluated (administratively
and on-site). The sourcing
of foreign materials is only
evaluated administratively,
usually via certification and
labels.

Heijmans has a procurement system, creates
standardised contracts with
larger parties in which
sustainability aspects are
also handled, and evaluates
suppliers via an evaluation
system.

The evaluation of
procurement processes
takes place within the ISO
9001/14001-certified
system.

Increasing sustainability in
business operations and
chain (Chapter:
Sustainability
achievements)

Clients and the government have expressed a
desire for more sustainability. This is expressed in
targets with respect to
Heijmans’ business
operations and those of its
chain partners.

The scope of increasing
sustainability is the built
environment in the
Netherlands and focuses
on three priorities. The
products/services we
produce, our own business
operations (NL only) and
the initiatives in the chain
for the most important
procured materials.

Management of processes
takes place within the
framework of the certified
management system and
is reflected in various
reports and KPIs.

The evaluation takes place
within the ISO
9001/14001-certified
management system.

Knowledge intensity
(Chapter: People and
organisation)

The nature of contracts are
becoming more comprehensive and technologically complex. By
responding to this with
sufficient knowledge and
expertise, the organisation
is becoming increasingly
knowledge intensive.

The scope of this aspect is
the Dutch market, and is
decided by the nature of
the contracts on the
market.

The regular HR processes of
inflow, through-flow and
outflow and participation in
the knowledge platforms
within the organisation
stimulate the building of
knowledge.

The evaluation takes place
during project evaluations
as part of the management
system and during specific
HR assessments.
