Some chapters in the Risk, funding & capital section of this Annual Report contain audited information
‘audited’ in the respective headings. In this section, capital metrics and risk exposures are reported
under the Basel III (CRD IV/CRR) framework. Some chapters in this section contain information according
to Pillar 3 and Enhanced Disclosure Task Force (EDTF) requirements. Additionally, the quantitative

for offsetting with effect from Q2 2016. The bank offsets balances if it is legally entitled to set off the
recognised amounts and intends to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability
agreements. The adjusted offsetting policy has been applied consistently to all assets and liabilities,
if applicable. In addition to the offsetting changes in notional cash pooling, ABN AMRO concluded
that offsetting should no longer be applied to bank savings mortgages. To ensure a correct historical
interpretation of the bank’s performance, the comparative figures for the net interest margin (NIM)

Introduction

Strategy and performance / Group performance / Financial review

Large incidentals1
A review of the treatment of credit risk allowances and interest income on impaired
loans resulted in an adjustment of EUR 74 million (net interest income).

Sale of Private Banking Asia

Release of mortgage penalty interest resulting from interest
rate renewals

In Q2 2017 ABN AMRO concluded the sale of the Private Banking business in Asia
(the PB Asia divestment). The total gross sale proceeds amounted to EUR 263 million
(tax-exempt), recorded as other operating income. Costs related to the sale were
EUR 21 million in personnel expenses and EUR 35 million in other expenses
(both tax-exempt). The 2016 figures included a full contribution from the business.

Provision for Euribor mortgages
In December the Amsterdam Court of Appeal ruled against ABN AMRO in a case
where ABN AMRO raised surcharges for mortgages with Euribor interest rates.
Given the nature and scope of this ruling, the figure for 2017 includes an increase
of EUR 52 million (net interest income) in the existing provision. The associated
handling costs were EUR 2 million (other expenses).

A change in the accounting policy for mortgage interest rate renewals prior to the end
of the interest period led to a release of EUR 49 million of mortgage penalty interest
in net interest income. This mortgage penalty interest is now being amortised over
the original interest term instead of over the new term.

Provision for ICS

The figure for 2017 includes EUR 164 million in restructuring provisions for further
digitalisation and process optimisation, compared with EUR 348 million in 2016.

The figure for 2017 includes an addition of EUR 8 million (net interest income) to
the provision for ICS, associated handling costs were EUR 1 million (other expenses).
The figure for 2016 included a provision for ICS of EUR 47 million, booked as net interest
income. The associated handling costs in 2016 were EUR 16 million (other expenses).

Book profits and revaluation gains
The figure for 2017 includes the proceeds of the sale of the remaining equity stake
in Visa Inc. The sale of these shares resulted in a EUR 114 million pre-tax gain.
The figure for 2016 included a EUR 116 million pre-tax gain on the sale of Visa Europe
shares and a revaluation gain of EUR 52 million on the stake in Equens.

In Q2 2016, the addition to the provision for SME derivatives-related issues of
EUR 361 million gross (EUR 10 million net interest income and EUR 351 million other
operating income) was classified as a special item. This provision was taken following
ABN AMRO’s decision to adhere to the advice of the committee of independent
experts on the reassessment of SME interest rate derivatives. In addition, the provision
for 2016 included an adjustment of EUR 10 million in net interest income, EUR 25 million
in other operating income and EUR 89 million in other expenses. The provision
for 2017 includes an adjustment of EUR 21 million for other operating income

Sustainable growth

4. To emphasize our sustainable growth ambition we treat our
employees as our most valuable asset. Therefore we focus on our
employee’s ambition, expertise, development and well-being and
have a performance management approach which is strength-based
and forward-looking. Moreover, we aim to promote cost awareness
and balance a healthy payroll versus revenues.

Moderate risk profile

3. ABN AMRO adheres to all applicable rules and regulations on
remuneration. Performance criteria should not provide any incentives
for excessive risk taking. We pay our employees in line with the
relevant market. Our total pay package is at the median of the market,
but we have the possibility to differentiate to reward specific skills
or talents. Our pay levels are positioned at internal and external
equity via job grading and benchmarking.

Annual Financial Statements

Invest in the future

2. We need to have a more flexible and agile workforce and want to be
an attractive employer for which talented people are eager to work.
Therefore we want our employees to be able to work any place,
any time and in any way. We support our staff with the tools and
resources they need to do their job (now and in the future) and to focus
on their physical and mental well-being, so that they are well equipped
to deal with the ever-changing environment. Our reward offering
reflects the need of flexibility and agility.

Governance

Client-driven

1. Our clients’ interests come first in everything we do. We make sure
that our employees understand the client’s needs, deliver high-quality
advice, service our clients in a more flexible and fast manner and
focus on long-term relationships with our clients. In order to ensure
our clients’ interests are met, we look closely at what kind of
performance is being rewarded. We use a balanced set of KPIs to
assess employee performance in which acting in the best interest
of our clients is essential.

IFRS 9 replaces the ‘incurred loss’ model by the ‘expected credit loss (ECL) model’, which is
designed to be forward-looking. The IFRS 9 impairments requirements are applicable to financial
assets measured at amortised cost or FVOCI, as well as to loan commitments and financial
guarantee contracts. These assets will be divided into three groups, depending on the stage of
credit risk deterioration:

Strategy and performance

Impairments

ÅÅ Financial assets without a significant increase in credit risk (stage 1): the portion of the lifetime
expected credit losses associated with default events occurring in the next twelve months

(LECL) is recognised. Interest revenue is recognised, based on the gross carrying amount;
ÅÅ Credit-impaired financial assets (stage 3): these financial assets are defaulted and consequently
a LECL is recognised. Interest revenue is recognised, based on the amortised cost.

(12M ECL) is recognised. Interest revenue is recognised, based on the gross carrying amount;
ÅÅ Financial assets with significantly increased credit risk (stage 2): lifetime expected credit loss

ABN AMRO has chosen to apply the same default definition under IFRS 9 as it currently uses for credit
risk management purposes (see Risk Management chapter). The key quantitative metric determining
(LPD) from the date of origination to the reporting date. The LPD represents the likelihood that a
counterparty will default during the lifetime of the financial instrument and depends on credit risk
drivers such as characteristics of the financial asset, the financial condition of the borrower, the number
of days past due, the geographical region and future developments in the economy. Due to limitations
in the availability of historical data, the LPD cannot yet be determined for certain financial assets.

ABN AMRO makes a distinction between two types of calculation methods for credit loss allowances:
ÅÅ Specific LECL for credit-impaired (stage 3) significant, individual financial assets: if significant

the expected future cash flows;
ÅÅ Collective 12M ECL and LECL for non-credit-impaired (stage 1 and 2) financial assets and
collective LECL for credit-impaired (stage 3) insignificant, individual financial assets that have
similar credit risk characteristics, that are clustered in portfolios and that are collectively assessed
for impairment losses. ABN AMRO has introduced new models to quantify the Probability of Loss
(PL), Loss Given Loss (LGL) and Exposure at Loss (EAL) for calculating the collective 12M ECL

Based on the current status of the IFRS 9 implementation, the transition to IFRS 9 is estimated
to result in the following at 1 January 2018:
ÅÅ The classification and measurement requirements will result in an estimated reduction
of approximately EUR 200 million in the carrying amounts of specific financial assets;

ÅÅ The impairments requirements will result in an increase of approximately EUR 200 million
in credit loss allowances. This increase is mainly based on the difference between the combined

The combined effect, net of tax, will be deducted from equity. The CET1 ratio, after adjustment of

The regulatory transitional arrangements which allow for gradual phasing-in of the negative impact

Retail Banking
Net interest income rose by 3% to EUR 3,439 million (2016: EUR 3,355 million). Interest income on
increased competition was offset by relatively high margins on the repricing portion of the mortgage
book. Income from savings and deposits benefited from improved margins following the reduction
in the rate paid on main retail deposits. Lending income declined on the back of lower volumes and
margins. Income in 2017 was negatively impacted by a EUR 42 million provision for the Euribor claim
and a EUR 8 million provision for ICS (2016: EUR 47 million).

Net fee and commission income at EUR 406 million (2016: EUR 463 million) decreased by 12%.
This decrease was partly due to lower fees being charged for payment packages to small businesses

Other operating income amounted to EUR 116 million (2016: EUR 93 million). Other operating
income was mostly driven by the sale of the remaining equity stake in Visa Inc., resulting in a pre-tax
book gain in 2017 of EUR 114 million. The figure for 2016 included a EUR 116 million pre-tax gain on

the sale of Visa Europe shares, of which EUR 101 million was booked within Retail Banking.

The increase was due to a restructuring provision for ICS of EUR 24 million. Excluding the impact
of the provision, personnel expenses decreased due to the lower numbers of FTE (5,192 compared
with 5,266 in 2016). The FTE reduction was supported by an increase in online and mobile banking
and an associated reduction in the number of branches (202 branches versus 221 in Q4 2016).

Personnel expenses increased by EUR 16 million to EUR 486 million in 2017 (2016: EUR 470 million).

General and administrative expenses at EUR 530 million increased by EUR 17 million in 2017,
mainly owing to higher regulatory levies (EUR 155 million compared with EUR 136 million in 2016).

Annual Financial Statements 2017 / Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements

Net interest income
Strategy and performance

Accounting policy for net interest income and expense
ABN AMRO applies IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. Interest income
and expenses are recognised in the income statement on an accrual basis for all financial
instruments using the effective interest rate method, except for those financial instruments held
for trading. The effective interest rate method allocates interest, amortisation of any discount or
premium or other differences, including transaction costs and qualifying fees and commissions,
over the expected lives of the assets and liabilities. The effective interest rate method requires the
Group to estimate future cash flows, in some cases based on its experience of customer behaviour,
considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument, as well as expected lives of the assets

Risk, funding & capital

and liabilities. Due to the large number of products, there are no individual estimates that are
material to the bank’s results or financial position. Interest income and expenses of trading balances
are included in net trading income. Interest paid on assets with a negative interest yield is classified
as interest expense. Interest received from liabilities with a negative interest yield is classified as
interest income.

Governance

Excluding the impact of the PB Asia divestment, net interest income rose by EUR 223 million.
Positive volume developments on mortgages, improving margins on deposits (consumer and
corporate) and growth of the loan book were offset by lower net interest income at Global Markets
and increased buffer and steering costs at ALM.

Annual Financial Statements 2017 / Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements

Interest income amounted to EUR 12,502 million in 2017, a decrease of EUR 149 million compared
with EUR 12,651 million in 2016. Interest income from items not at fair value through profit or loss

Strategy and performance

amounted to EUR 9,775 million (2016: EUR 9,906 million).
The 2017 results were impacted by positive incidentals such as a review of the treatment of credit
risk allowances and interest income on impaired loans, which resulted in an adjustment of
EUR 74 million. A change in the accounting policy for interest rate renewals of mortgages prior to
the end of the interest period led to a release of penalty interest of EUR 49 million in interest
income. The figures for 2017 also included a provision for ICS of EUR 8 million (2016: EUR 47 million).
A negative incidental was the ruling of the Court of Appeal against ABN AMRO in a case in

Risk, funding & capital

which ABN AMRO had raised surcharges for mortgages with Euribor interest rates. This resulted
in a provision of EUR 52 million.
Other includes interest income on hedging instruments for an amount of EUR 1,945 million

The interest expense on ABN AMRO’s participation in TLTRO II is linked to the interest rate on the
deposit facility (-0.4%), subject to certain conditions. In 2017 ABN AMRO concluded that these
conditions would be met with reasonable assurance, thus leading to the recognition of a government
grant. A discount of EUR 29 million was recognised in interest expense due to banks.

Net fee and commission income
Strategy and performance

Accounting policy for net fee and commission income
ABN AMRO applies IAS 18 Revenue. Fees and commissions are recognised as the services are
provided. The following fee types are identified:
ÅÅ Service fees are recognised on a straight-line basis over the service contract period; portfolio and
other management advisory and service fees are recognised based on the applicable service
contracts;
ÅÅ Fees arising from negotiating or participating in the negotiation of a transaction for a third party
are recognised upon completion of the underlying transaction. Commission revenue is recognised
when the performance obligation is complete. Loan syndication fees are recognised as revenue

Risk, funding & capital

when the syndication has been completed.
Fees and commissions dependent on the outcome of a particular event or contingent upon
performance are recognised when the following criteria have been met:
ÅÅ The fees are realised and earned;
ÅÅ The earnings process is completed by performing according to the terms of the arrangements,
not simply by originating a revenue-generating arrangement;
ÅÅ If services are rendered or rights to use assets extend continuously over time (for example,
are commonly available, revenues may be recognised as time passes.

(EUR 50 million) and because of lower fees from payment services due to a reduction in client rates
for payment packages. Lower fee and commission income was partly offset by a reclassification of

In accordance with IAS 39, trading positions are held at fair value, and net trading income includes
gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of financial assets and liabilities. The latter
comprise trading financial assets and liabilities, interest income and expenses related to trading
financial assets and liabilities, dividends received from trading instruments and related funding costs.

discontinued securities financing activities (Group Functions) and SME derivatives-related issues
(Corporate & Institutional Banking). For more details, please refer to note 29 Provisions.
Interest income from instrument trading increased by EUR 403 million in 2017 compared with 2016.
The increase was driven by the provisions for SME derivatives-related issues in Corporate &
Institutional Banking in 2016, and the effect of CVA and DVA results (EUR 83 million in 2017 versus
EUR 0 million in 2016).

Leadership structure

Equity trading income increased to EUR 76 million compared with 2016, owing to a tax-exempt
provision related to discontinued securities financing activities.
Foreign exchange transactions results decreased to EUR 146 million in 2017, down by EUR 37 million
compared with 2016. The decrease was mainly due to lower client activity levels in 2017 compared
with 2016.

Other operating income

Accounting policy for other operating income
Other operating income includes all other banking activities such as leasing activities and results
on the disposal of assets. It also includes the change in fair value of derivatives used for risk
management purposes that do not meet the requirements of IAS 39 for hedge accounting,
designated at fair value through profit or loss, and changes in the value of any related derivatives.
For liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss, it includes changes in own credit
spreads Dividend income from non-trading equity investments is recognised when entitlement

Disposal of operating activities and equity accounted investments increased, mainly due to the
PB Asia divestment in the first half of 2017.
The result from financial transactions increased by EUR 171 million in 2017 compared with 2016,
mainly due to hedge accounting-related results at Group Functions. The figures for 2017 include
the proceeds of the sale of the remaining equity stake in Visa Inc. The sale of these shares resulted
in a EUR 114 million pre-tax gain. The figures for 2016 included a EUR 116 million pre-tax gain on the

Agency staff, contractors and consultancy costs decreased by EUR 113 million, mainly due to lower
consultancy fees (EUR 67 million lower than in 2016).
In the line item Other, provisions for legal matters increased by EUR 85 million. This was mainly due
to the provision for SME derivatives-related issues, which rose by EUR 139 million in 2017.

10 Income tax expense, tax assets and tax liabilities
Accounting policy for income tax expense, tax assets and tax liabilities
ABN AMRO applies IAS 12 Income Taxes in accounting for taxes on income.
​ABN AMRO is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Income tax expense consists
of current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement in the period in

Risk, funding & capital

which profits arise. Withholding taxes are included in trading income. Income tax recoverable on
tax-allowable losses is recognised as a current tax asset only to the extent that it is regarded as
recoverable by offsetting against taxable profits arising in the current or prior period. Current tax
is measured using tax rates enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised for qualifying temporary differences. Temporary differences represent
the difference between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes
and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the

Leadership structure

expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using
tax rates enacted at the balance sheet date. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent
that it is probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only when there is both a legal right to offset and
an intention to settle on a net basis.

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will
allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. Recognition is based on estimates of sufficient taxable
income by jurisdiction in which ABN AMRO operates, available tax planning opportunities, and the
period over which deferred tax assets are recoverable. In the event that actual results differ from
these estimates in future periods, and depending on the tax strategies that ABN AMRO may be able
to implement, changes to the recognition of deferred tax assets could be required, and these could
impact on our financial position and net profit.

Annual Financial Statements 2017 / Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements

ABN AMRO does not have any dilutive potential ordinary shares. Therefore only basic earnings per ordinary
share is disclosed. Basic earnings per ordinary share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to

Strategy and performance

the shareholders of ABN AMRO Group by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding.
The earnings per share in 2017 amounted to EUR 2.89 (2016: EUR 1.87). This is an increase of
EUR 1.02, or 55%. A final dividend of EUR 0.80 per share will be proposed for 2017 (2016: EUR 0.44).
Including the interim dividend paid on 8 September 2017 (EUR 611 million), the total dividend will
amount to EUR 1.45 per share (2016: EUR 0.84).

Cash and balances at central banks increased by EUR 7.9 billion to EUR 29.8 billion at 31 December 2017,
mainly due to higher outstanding overnight positions placed at the Dutch central bank and other central
banks in Europe. Part of the increase is due to a reclassification in the balance as per 31 December 2017

Financial assets held for trading remained stable at EUR 1.6 billion at 31 December 2017.

Strategy and performance

Government bonds decreased slightly by EUR 0.1 billion, mainly related to changes in Dutch and
Belgian bond positions. These portfolios are mainly a result of the primary dealership in these
countries and held for the purpose of client facilitation. These contracts are hedged with short
positions in corporate debt securities, government bonds and futures.
Equity securities increased slightly by EUR 0.1 billion, driven by an increase in derivative contracts
used for client facilitation.

15 Hedge accounting
ABN AMRO enters into various derivative and non-derivative instrument transactions with
external parties to hedge risks on assets, liabilities, forecasted cash flows and net investments.
The accounting treatment of the hedged item and the hedging instrument depends on whether
the hedge relationship qualifies for hedge accounting.

investments. A non-derivative financial asset or liability may be designated as a hedging instrument for

However, these are generally not included in hedge accounting relationships.
Both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, ABN AMRO formally assesses whether
the derivatives used in its hedging transactions have been highly effective in offsetting changes in
the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item by assessing and measuring whether changes in the
fair value or cash flows of the hedged item are offset by the changes in the fair value or cash flows

portfolio. In 2017, ABN AMRO managed the interest rate risk by unwinding approximately
EUR 8 billion of swaps in the cash flow hedges and by entering into EUR 1 billion of new swaps. This
led to the notional amount of cash flow hedges decreasing from EUR 36.3 billion to EUR 29.1 billion.

Introduction

Annual Financial Statements 2017 / Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements

The decrease in the fair value of the interest rate derivatives was mainly caused by the increase in longterm interest rates in 2017 and the clearing of a large part of the interest rate swaps portfolio at a CCP.

Strategy and performance

The market value of these swaps is settled on a daily basis, which results in a fair value of nil. This
applies to all swaps in the cash flow hedges and the majority of the swaps in the fair value hedges.
In 2016, the economic hedges included opposite interest rate swaps with different counterparties
to manage the exposure on a large counterparty. In 2017, these swaps were cleared by a CCP and
subsequently cancelled, which explains the decrease in the notional amount of the economic hedges.

Fair value hedge accounting
Risk, funding & capital

ABN AMRO applies fair value hedge accounting to individual hedged items (micro fair value
hedging), as well as to a portfolio of hedged items (macro fair value hedging).

Micro fair value hedge accounting

Macro fair value hedge accounting
ABN AMRO hedges interest rate exposures of fixed-rate mortgages on a portfolio basis, using interest

which it designates interest rate swaps as hedging instruments and fixed-rate mortgages as hedged
items. The hedge accounting relationship is reviewed and redesignated on a monthly basis.

Introduction

Annual Financial Statements 2017 / Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements

Hedged mortgages are fixed-rate mortgages with the following features:

ÅÅ ​​​​​​​denominated in local currency (euro);
ÅÅ fixed term to maturity or repricing;
ÅÅ pre-payable amortising or fixed principal amounts;
ÅÅ fixed interest payment dates;
ÅÅ no interest rate options;
ÅÅ accounted for on an amortised cost basis.
Mortgages with these features form a portfolio of which the hedged item is designated in a fair value
hedge accounting relationship. More than one group (or portfolio) of mortgages can be identified as
the hedged item within the fixed-rate mortgage portfolio. Hedged items are designated on a monthly

Risk, funding & capital

basis to maintain an effective hedge accounting relationship.
Mortgage cash flows are allocated to monthly time buckets, based on expected maturity dates.
ABN AMRO models the maturity dates of mortgages, taking into account a prepayment rate applied
to the contractual cash flows and maturity dates of the mortgage portfolio. If the swap notional
exceeds 95% of the expected mortgage notional in any given month, mortgages that mature one
month earlier or one month later are designated to the swaps.

Leadership structure

Changes in the fair value of mortgages which are attributable to the hedged interest rate risk are
recorded under fair value adjustment from hedge accounting in order to adjust the carrying amount
of the loan. The difference between the fair value attributable to the hedged interest rate risk and the
carrying value of the hedged mortgages at de-designation of the hedge relationship is amortised
over the remaining life of the hedged item.

assets differ slightly from the characteristics of the hedging instruments.

Cash flow hedge accounting
ABN AMRO applies macro cash flow hedge accounting by which it designates interest rate swaps as
hedging instruments and future cash flows on non-trading assets and liabilities as hedged items. The hedge
accounting relationship is reviewed on a monthly basis and the hedging instruments and hedged items are
de-designated or re-designated, if necessary, to maintain an effective hedge accounting relationship.

Future cash flows are derived from the projected balance sheet. This projected balance sheet is

conditions of financial assets and liabilities and combines these with estimated prepayments, growth
rates and interest scenarios, based on statistical market and client data and an economic outlook.

230
Introduction

Annual Financial Statements 2017 / Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements

The primary interest-sensitive positions in the balance sheet stemming from the non-trading book
are loans and receivables, liabilities due to banks and customers, and issued debt securities.

Strategy and performance

Within the projected balance sheet, new assets and liabilities and the future repricing of existing
assets and liabilities are grouped, based on the specific interest rate index on which they reprice
(i.e. one month, three months, six months or one year). For each repricing index, all assets and
liabilities are allocated to monthly clusters in which they reprice up until their maturity. Interest
rate swaps are designated to these clusters, based on their repricing index and maturity.
The notional amounts of pay- or receive-floating swaps are designated to repricing all or a portion of
current and forecasted assets and liabilities, respectively, in the clusters described above. These swap

Risk, funding & capital

transactions are designated for hedge accounting purposes as a hedge of a gross position of a cluster
of projected cash flows. In addition, the swap will only hedge the applicable floating swap rate portion
of the interest repricing and reinvestment risk of the cluster. The availability of projected cash flows in
the clusters is not constant over time and is therefore evaluated on a monthly basis. Changes in cash
flow projections may lead to revision of the designation. Back-testing is also performed on the interest
rate risk sensitivity models. Historical data are used to review the assumptions applied.

Accounting policy for available for sale investments
Available-for-sale assets are held at fair value with unrealised gains and losses recognised directly in other
comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. Interest earned, premiums, discounts and qualifying trans­
action costs of interest earning available-for-sale assets are amortised to income on an effective inter­est rate

Annual Financial Statements 2017 / Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements

For financial instruments where no active liquid market exists, or quoted prices are unobtainable,
recent market transactions are used or the fair value is estimated using a variety of valuation
models such as discounted cash flow calculation or option pricing models (e.g. Black Scholes).
When portfolios of financial assets and liabilities are measured on the basis of the net exposure to
the credit risk of a particular counterparty, any existing arrangements that mitigate the credit risk

using a discounted cash flow model. The main inputs are the interest rate curve, liquidity spread and

The total amount of notes sold to external parties amounted to EUR 1.3 billion at 31 December 2017,
a decrease of EUR 1.1 billion compared with EUR 2.4 billion at 31 December 2016. The decrease was
due to the calling of several securitisation transactions.

Approaches to calculating risk exposure amount
ABN AMRO does not achieve significant risk transfers for any of the mortgage securitisations.

Strategy and performance

Therefore, the look-through approach is used and RWA (REA) reduction is not applied.
Monitoring process
ABN AMRO periodically monitors changes in credit risk relating to securitisation exposures.
The significance of the amount of credit risk transferred to third parties by securitisation of own
originated assets is assessed on a monthly basis in accordance with the regulatory significant risk
transfer test. For investments in third-party securitisations, the risk is monitored by reviewing the
investor reports of these transactions. Additionally, third-party securitisation positions are included in
the firm-wide comprehensive stress tests in which the downgrade and default risks under stressed

market conditions are assessed.

Overview of securitisation positions and securitised assets
The total amount of assets securitised in true sale securitisations decreased to EUR 32.8 billion
at 31 December 2017 (31 December 2016: EUR 39.7 billion). No securitisation transactions for
the purpose of capital relief were originated in 2017.

23 Property and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets
In accordance with IAS 16, property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation
and any amount for impairment. At each balance sheet date, an assessment is performed to
determine whether there is any indication of impairment. Subsequent costs are capitalised if these
result in an enhancement to the asset. Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a
straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of items of property and equipment, and of major
components that are accounted for separately. ABN AMRO generally uses the following useful lives

Accounting policy for intangible assets
Goodwill
Goodwill is determined in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations and IAS 36 Impairments
of Assets. Goodwill is capitalised and stated at cost, being the excess of the consideration paid over
acquisition, less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of calculating goodwill, the fair
values of acquired assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are determined by reference to market
values or by discounting expected future cash flows to present value. Goodwill is not amortised, but
is reviewed annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that impairment may
have occurred. In the test the carrying amount of goodwill is compared with the higher of the fair
value less costs to sell and the value in use, being the present value of the cash flows discounted at
a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the risk of the cash-generating unit to which the goodwill relates.

Introduction

Annual Financial Statements 2017 / Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements

Impairment of goodwill
Impairment testing on goodwill is performed at least annually by comparing the recoverable amount

Strategy and performance

of the cash-generating units (CGU) to their carrying amount. The CGU is the smallest identifiable
group of assets that:
ÅÅ generate cash inflows from continuing use; and
ÅÅ are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.
Identification of an asset’s cash-generating unit involves judgement. If recoverable amount cannot be
determined for an individual asset, an entity identifies the lowest aggregation of assets generating
largely independent cash inflows. The recoverable amount is determined by the higher of the value
in use or fair value less costs to sell. The type of the acquired entity determines the definition of

Risk, funding & capital

the type of CGU.
The value in use of a CGU is assessed through a discounted cash flow model of the anticipated
future cash flows of the CGU. The discounted cash flow model uses assumptions which depend
on various financial and economic variables, including the risk-free rate in a given country and a
premium to reflect the inherent risk of the entity being assessed. The values assigned to each key
assumption reflect past experience, modified based on management’s expectation for the future,
and are consistent with external sources of information.

Leadership structure

Besides the discount rates stated in the following table, calculation of the value in use was also
based on cash flows, projected based on past experience, actual operating results and the 5-year
budget plan. Cash flows for a further 5-year period were extrapolated using the long-term growth
rate stated for the CGU.

Introduction

Annual Financial Statements 2017 / Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements

Unit-linked investments are investments on behalf of insurance contract policyholders who bear the
investment risk. Minimum guaranteed rates are agreed for certain contracts.

Strategy and performance

As at 31 December 2017, unit-linked policyholders decreased to zero as a result of the ‘held for sale’
classification of its private banking subsidiary ABN AMRO Bank (Luxembourg) S.A., including its fully
owned subsidiary ABN AMRO Life S.A., and the non-consolidation of investments owned by
policyholders of ABN AMRO Pensioeninstelling, where ABN AMRO concluded that these assets
should be treated as a silo as defined by IFRS 10.
Reinsurers’ share, trade and other receivables include the amount of the receivables purchased
by ABN AMRO (the factor) from its clients under non-recourse factoring contracts.

Other assets in 2017 and 2016 include a net receivable of EUR 204 million, mainly related to the
bankruptcy of DSB Bank.

28 Issued debt and subordinated liabilities
Issued debt securities and subordinated liabilities are recorded at amortised cost using the effective
interest rate method, unless they are of a hybrid or structured nature and irrevocably designated

instruments are held to reduce an accounting mismatch, are managed on the basis of their fair value

liabilities where the substance of the contractual arrangement results in ABN AMRO having a present
exchange of a fixed number of equity shares. Preference shares that carry a non-discretionary coupon

current and future liabilities of ABN AMRO and its subsidiaries.

Strategy and performance

The measurement of liabilities held at fair value includes the effect of changes in own credit spreads.
The change in fair value applies to those financial liabilities designated at fair value where own credit

29 Provisions
Accounting policy for provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when ABN AMRO has a legal or constructive
obligation as a result of a past event, and it is more likely than not that an outflow of economic
benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount of the

Leadership structure

obligation can be made. If the effect of time value is material, provisions are determined by
discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market rates and,
where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
A provision for restructuring is recognised when an obligation exists. An obligation exists when
ABN AMRO has approved a detailed plan and has raised a valid expectation in those affected by the
plan by starting to implement the plan or by announcing its main features. Future operating costs are
not provided for. Provisions for insurance risks are determined by actuarial methods, which include

Provisions are established for certain guarantee contracts for which ABN AMRO is responsible
to pay upon default of payment.

ABN AMRO sponsors a number of pension schemes in the Netherlands and abroad. IAS 19 applies
to the accounting of these schemes. These schemes are mainly defined contribution plans. The
majority of the beneficiaries of the plans are located in the Netherlands.

For defined contribution plans, ABN AMRO pays annual contributions determined by a fixed method

33 Transferred, pledged, encumbered and restricted assets
Transferred financial assets are arrangements/transactions for which ABN AMRO has:
ÅÅ transferred the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset to a third party, or;
ÅÅ retained the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of that financial asset, but has
assumed a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to a third party; or
ÅÅ alternatively, transferred a financial asset when the counterparty has the right to re-pledge
or to re-sell the asset.

In principle, pledged assets are encumbered assets. The following differences apply to ABN AMRO:

ÅÅ Encumbered assets exclude assets pledged for unused credit facilities with central banks at the

Significant restrictions on assets may arise from statutory, contractual or regulatory requirements

This disclosure provides insight into the relationship between these transferred financial assets and
associated financial liabilities in order to show which risks the bank is exposed to when the assets
are transferred.
If transferred financial assets continue to be recognised in the balance sheet, ABN AMRO Group is
still exposed to changes in the fair value of the assets.

ABN AMRO expects most acceptances to be settled simultaneously with the reimbursement from
clients. Acceptances are not recognised in the balance sheet and are disclosed as commitments.

A financial guarantee contract requires the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder
for a loss it incurs if a specified debtor fails to make payment when due under the original or modified
terms of a debt instrument. Initial recognition of financial guarantee contracts is at their fair value.
Subsequent measurement is the higher of the amount initially recognised less cumulative amortisation,

A legal demerger may cause so-called cross-liabilities. Pursuant to section 2:334t of the Dutch Civil Code,
the acquiring company or companies and the demerging company, if it continues to exist, are jointly and
severally liable for the obligations of the demerging company at the time of the demerger. The acquiring
companies and the continuing demerged company will remain fully liable for indivisible obligations. In the

Introduction

Other / Definitions of important terms

Market risk in the banking book, mainly interest rate risk, is the risk of a yield curve development that is unfavourable
for the bank. Other market risks are limited in the banking book, either through hedging (foreign rate exchange risk)
or in general (other market risk types).

Market risk (trading book)

Market risk in the trading book is the risk of loss resulting from unfavourable market price movements which can
arise from trading or holding positions in financial instruments in the trading book.

Medium-term notes (MTN)

Medium-term notes are unsecured funding instruments with maturities up to ten years and issued in several
currencies.

Net Promoter Score (NPS)

This metric shows the extent to which customers would recommend ABN AMRO to others. The customer is
regarded as a ‘promoter’ (score of 9 or 10), as ‘passively satisfied’ (score of 7 or 8) or as a ‘detractor’ (score of 0 to 6).
The NPS is calculated by subtracting the percentage of ‘detractors’ from the percentage of ‘promoters’. The score
is expressed as an absolute number between -100 and +100.

Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR)

The objective of the NSFR is to promote resilience over a longer time horizon by creating additional incentives to fund
activities with more stable sources of funding on an ongoing basis.

NII-at-Risk

The NII-at-Risk metric indicates the change in net interest income during the coming 12 months, comparing the NII
calculated using a constant yield curve with the NII calculated using a yield curve that is gradually shifted to a total
of 200 basis points. The net interest income is negatively impacted when rates rise.

NLFI

Stichting administratiekantoor beheer financiële instellingen (NL Financial Investments). On 29 September 2011 the
Dutch State transferred its shares in ABN AMRO Group N.V. and in ABN AMRO Preferred Investments B.V. to NLFI.
NLFI is a foundation and was set up to avoid potential conflicting responsibilities that the Minister of Finance might
otherwise face, as a shareholder and as a regulator, and to avoid political influence being exerted.

Operational risk

Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people or systems or from
external events.

Past due exposure

A financial asset is past due if a counterparty has failed to make a payment when contractually due, if it has
exceeded an advised limit or if it has been advised of a limit lower than its current outstanding.

Past due ratio

The past due ratio shows which fraction of the gross carrying amount of a financial asset category is past due
but not impaired.

Permanent modification

Terms and conditions of a contract such as interest, principal, repayment terms, tenor or financial covenants
are changed permanently.

Preference share

A share that receives a fixed rate of dividend ahead of ordinary shares.

Qualifying revolving exposures

Qualifying revolving exposures are revolving, unsecured and uncommitted exposures to private individuals that
meet additional criteria specified in the CRD. These outstanding balances are permitted to fluctuate, based on
decisions to borrow and repay, up to a limit set by the bank.

Refinancing

A contract is considered to be refinanced when the objective of the new contract is to enable the repayment
or partial repayment of an existing contract where the counterparty is unable to meet the existing obligations.

Risk-weighted assets (RWA)

Total assets and off-balance sheet items calculated to reflect the risks relating to the various balance sheet items.

Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS)

The Royal Bank of Scotland N.V., formerly known as ABN AMRO Bank N.V. prior to the Legal Demerger.

Savings mortgages

Savings mortgages are mortgages with a separate savings account, whereby the savings balance is used to repay
the principal at maturity.

STAK AAG

An independent holder of shares in ABN AMRO Group’s issued share capital, for the purpose of administration
(ten titel van beheer) in exchange for depositary receipts.

Standardised Approach (Basel II)

This approach measures credit risk in a standardised manner, supported by external credit assessments.

Sustainable client assets

Sustainable client assets are assets that ABN AMRO invests for its clients in investment funds, products and
securities that explicitly base their investment approach and decisions on sustainable criteria. These investments
explicitly factor in the social and environmental effects of investments.

Temporary modification

Terms and conditions of a contract such as interest, principal, repayment terms, tenor or financial covenants
are changed temporarily.

Tier 1 ratio

Tier 1 capital, the sum of the bank's CET1 capital and AT1 capital, expressed as a percentage of total
risk-weighted assets.

Trust Monitor AFM/NvB

A survey conducted by market research institute GfK on what people in the Netherlands think about banks
in general and their own bank and how they experience various aspects of services provided by banks.

Uniform Counterparty Rating (UCR)

The UCR is an obligor rating and refers to the probability of default by an obligor, i.e. the likelihood that a counterparty
will fail to pay interest and/or principal and/or other financial obligations to the bank.

Value-at-Risk banking book

Value-at-Risk banking book (VaR banking book) is used as a statistical measure for assessing interest risk exposure.
It estimates potential losses and is defined as the predicted maximum loss that might be caused by changes in risk
factors under normal circumstances, over a specified period of time, and at a specified level of statistical confidence.
A VaR for changes in the interest rate for the banking book is calculated at a 99% confidence level and a two-month
holding period.

Annual Financial Statements

Market risk (banking book)

Governance

The LCR is intended to promote resilience to potential liquidity disruptions over a thirty-day horizon. The LCR requires
banks to hold sufficient highly-liquid assets equal to or greater than the net cash outflow during a thirty-day period.
